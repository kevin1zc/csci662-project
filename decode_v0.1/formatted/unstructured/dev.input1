<0> I havven't been to Florence before.
<0> i dont collect stamps im into sports
<0> I don't even know!  She does that sometimes,  and just badgers you.  I can't figure out what fires her up.
<0> That seems to happen a lot. I wonder what causes hair to change color like that.
<0> I did,  I can't remember,  I either made an A or a B in there.
<1> I think it stems from too much education. Kids should spend more time working on the farm and less time learning in schools.
<1> Snoop Dogg  came to light on his own. and has his own label.
<1> Well I think the market for weight loss programs goes up during that time because they know people will be feeling bad about overeating probably, there's even 12-step programs for overeaters like Overeaters Anonymous.
<0> I think they look best in grey, it's an awesome balance between black and white
<1> Oh my gosh that's horrible. I hope they caught the person who hit her!
<1> Fruit flies play an important part in the ecosystem and shouldn't be killed indiscriminately. 
<1> That would be a great one. Oooh that's a great question, at this moment tortilla chips with a hint of jalapeno 
<1> I gave my kids smartphones, and now I have time to play tennis! We all get more time on our own - win, win!
<1> Good, you just need to be radical and a little crazy with her.
<0> i just made to turning 18 years old yesterday .
<1> that is strange .. but i want to redo them , i have been thinking about it
<0> She passed last year. She is in a better place.
<0> I am a graduate student. What about you?
<1> But I don't prefer 80s music.
<1> that is fantastic
<0> Black hair is dominant in black people,it is usually associated with black people
<0> I hate both concerts and museums, they are very boring.
<1> Brown hair can look great on older people as well. I always thought that light colored hair shows the grey more. 
<0> Oh man, I wonder how much that would be worth right now if you had one in pristine condition!
<1> that would be fun . my best friend could play too
<0> That's okay I am afraid of animals.
<0> There are not a lot of jobs here.
<1> wow, not really, Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as "one of America's original 
<1> That's unfortunate. What do you think about Uber?
<0> fancy teas are overrated. 
<1> no i sadly do not . i never been one to hold a steady relationship
<0> I do too on most days but this week has been bad for me.
<0> i am a fan of orange , which is why i've pet clown fish .
<1> Yeah, I hope it rains this weekend. 
<0> but I dont want to travel.
<0> Its top speed is not very well known, since only 39 250 GTOs were manufactured between 1962 and 1964.
<1> It's great. I kind of don't like organic food.
<0> I wonder. A lot of people take shark cartilage, but there's no science supporting that as a treatment.
<1> ah well it sounds like i hit the nail on the head
<0> i haven't been to a baseball game
<0> I don't think it would be terrifying at all. Clowns are so fun and amusing.
<0> I am trying to gain weight though for strength.
<1> i think that's really boring, what's so good about a promotion?
<1> I like to drink beer
<0> In salon
<1> lol . i play with my cats . what could be funner ? ! ?
<1> Well, there were a lot of rough episodes in the season, but I thought the final epsidoe did a pretty satisfying job of wrapping things up.
<1> I've never even heard of Doggstyle before 
<0> It is and yellow is also the color at the end of the visible light spectrum
<0> Fresh pasta was produced by hand but today it is available in most supermarkets. If you buy frozen pasta meals they have fresh pasta.
<1> I do. Just last week I won $1000!
<1> I think Harely is very bad choice.
<1> i loved listening to rock music while growing up
<1> Mainly horses and a lot of times I play poker right after work. 
<1> I hear that red pandas have black and white fur.
<0> It was rare - only 39 were made between 1962 and 1964.
<1> Ooooh, football is a good one. It's a great one for sure. Who's your favorite team?
<0> I really hate the fuji apples as they are just not tasty at all.
<0> His boss felt he was under-performing.  It's a shame because he was fun to work with
<0> I wish I had a boyfriend...
<1> Yeah it's easy to find a good man.
<0> Me too do that but in a salon as their charges are very cheap.
<0> Since cosmetologists cut and color hair, I'm thinking that might be a good career to get into!
<1> I don't like spaghetti at all but some kinds of pasta are great.
<1> I still thing living with a relative is the cheapest way to go.
<1> I'm glad you have something that helps keep his memory alive. :)
<1> We just have a guinea pig in our classroom.
<0> I'm super ready for it! I spent so much time studying over the last week.
<0> I know, I was so excited when I saw the letter from her in the mail!
<0> I wanted a sister sibling but only got a brother

<0> His album Doggy style has alot of fine songs
<0> I have three beautiful kids and you?
<0> Thanks, but I think I have a chronic fatigue just now, talk to you later.
<1> Oh I would love to witness a tornado and videotape it would be so neat!
<1> You shouldn't fall for it, therapy is for crazies.
<0> Yes, I heard gospel music for the first time a few days ago and have been hooked ever since.
<0> Do the flavors change depending on the color. What about red wine?
<0> Oh, well I actually hate target. 
<1> i have a black hair
<1> I have never dyed my hair, but If i would, it would not be black, I hate that color.
<0> I wonder in which parts of the world brown hair is most common
<1> Making fresh pasta actually doesn't take to long. You should try it. 
<1> I find being a software engineer always makes me think in new ways, I enjoy it
<0> Wow, that sounds awesome! How hard was it to learn?
<0> Not really, the game was so horrible that my nephew's team didn't even make one score.
<0> it can be hard to find time, it seems like the world is just so busy sometimes
<0> that i have everything i wished for.
<1> I would eat there as well but I don't have a job and cannot afford it.
<1> I think adding pepperoni would be great.
<1> ok good . but why dye your hair ? that is , like , drugs for your hair .
<1> Plus, it sounds so boring.
<1> I was always told that the reward for a "good deed" can actually be found in the deed itself.  You sound like a very responsible individual.  
<0> Well,  I did my best to save what I could. A lot of irreplaceable things were destroyed however,  photos among other things.
<0> I don't have a best friend. I'm kind of a loner.
<1> I'll be having spaghetti as soon as I'm done meditating.
<1> I'm actually not the biggest fan of Superman, he is probably one of the worst superheros there is. It's all about Batman, am I right?? 
<1> He wishes it was that exciting lol! 
<0> I love to just eat whatever I want to and I use working out as my excuse!
<0> I don't really like the color red at all.
<0> i have not no horses. i have only dogs.
<1> I live out in the woods but I hate hiking.
<1> Appreciate it, play any other instruments?
<1> Yes, once I buy a tv I'll be doing that as well.
<0> Well that's awesome lets go ahead and drink I did yesterday.
<0> Maybe just a bit, Just make sure its finely grated before use, and dried up into powder in a large container or a paste also sounds good. 
<0> oh that's where it came from, i always wondered
<0> I see, how is pizza sold? 
<0> That comes along with the job.  I am also an attorney.
<1> Yeah it’s very pleasant at that time. I hate it when sun is above me shining very bright and I get dizzy sometimes while walking.
<0> cali , it gets hot over here
<1> I do as well!  I really enjoy snorkeling and diving for scallops!  
<1> Did you tell him how nice he is?
<1> I agree, as long as you have friends you don't need money for anything.
<0> Hm I like him too, he's one of the best lyricist ever probably.
<1> You can buy lives again no problem.

<0> It's not made of plants, but synthetic chemicals
<0> I never watch Game of Thrones. 
<1> Don't worry if you do not, it's not the end of the world. I dropped out of high school and made a successful career running my own business.
<0> i feel terrible like always
<1> You should not be so hard on your neighbor.Be more patient!!
<0> I know right. I hate cats so I don't usually go to his house.
<1> I think that if things get hard, go ahead and get a little crazy and worked up. It helps to show others what is going on.
<0> I know nothing about stocks its all gibberish to me.
<1> Not as much as me, I walk 15 miles a day
<0> I was running on a road with a sidewalk,  I turned the corner and saw a deer staring at me. Can't believe I found one in my small suburban neighborhood.
<1> I do the same thing. Sushi while gaming at home, every weekend.
<1> I bet they would since Oregon is the one and only place to have a Bridal Veil falls. There aren't any, anywhere else in the United States.
<0> yes...maybe i will make that tonight!
<0> I'm not too knowledgeable about cars at all so I really can't help.
<0> Interesting.     Four leaf clovers are not as rare as some think.
<0> a big weeding you mean ? no .
<1> Yeah I agree, men always have been better and they always will be.
<1> Well just think that they try to entertain large audiences, and not try to kill people in most cases.
<0> The sky at sunset can have deep reds in it which is due to Rayleigh scattering
<0> aww that's not very nice of them . have you told the teachers ?
<1> Yeah, it’s never good to dwell on the past
<1> Don't worry I hate the beach! 
<1> Thats my favorite also. I cant stand all the new rock and hip hops stuff out right now.
<1> I wish he would've gone to GSW
<1> Those cars usually don't run well, right?
<1> does she own dogs like me ?
<1> I actually sold my Ford a couple of years ago, they're expensive to maintain.
<0> Luckily not the bar yet! Just the end of summer class.
<0> No, I'm not really into dogs, or pets, really.
<0> Sorry about that. What would you like to discuss? 
<0> Thank you. I attribute the success of our relationship to being good friends and having a good sense of humor. Are you married?
<0> Yeah. Unfortunately,  it was a monster! I am just ugly!
<0> Yes, I try to pick organic whenever I can, there are too many chemicals in our diet.
<0> I wish that I had played sports when I was younger
<1> i have never seen the flinstones! it is kind of Animation
<0> chona and she only eats veggies
<0> Being diabetic must make it hard. How do you handle the holidays? I am such a sweets person!
<0> Do you like that thumpy techno stuff, then?
<1> Good thing I don't have any kids
<0> I couldn't believe that no one let the cat out of the bag. It must have been hard to plan.
<0> I don't need car insurance. I'm lucky that I live in a city and don't own a car. I save a lot of money that way.
<0> You don't need much in order to bake bread.  All you need is dough of flour and water, plus a heat source of course.
<1> I wouldn't get him a watch, no one wears watches anymore. I sell phones for a living, maybe you can get him a new phone?
<0> I enjoy training any service animals, they do such great work and live such happy lives.
<0> I have not seen that show, other than the commercials for it. What color is his hair in that show?
<1> I agree, I will not let one single spider enter my household.
<0> I will turn 35 in two months, but i think im going to take out the grill and cook some stakes!
<0> A couple people. Fewer as the years go by,  unfortunately. 
<1> You're right. It probably wouldn't be too expensive.
<1> I guess. I just wish I could get a sign that I have a purpose.
<0> That's nice that you have an activity to do with your kid.
<0> Yes! I think group therapy is what would help me the best. I feel better when I talk about my overeating with others.
<1> they sang life is a highway in the movie cars !
<1> baking is not an old one. It started recently
<1> Perhaps I should find the local shelter in my community and do the same. I have never done that before and I feel like I should be giving back to those less fortunate in some capacity.
<0> now i will go lunch. after the lunch i will give tips
<0> Thanks! It's been a nice 10 years as a vegan maybe I can get a veteran card :D
<0> Thanks I am super excited I know I will have a great outcome I have goals to meet.
<0> I'm not looking to make a good or bad impression. I just want to do my job and go home. 
<1> Never, we haven't visited there before but we really want to.
<0> Hey, whatever puts bacon on the table.
<1> That's cool. It's nice to have these things

<0> He was an American communications magnate. In 1969 Fiat acquired 50% of Ferrari and now own 90%.
<0> I am.  I love my job, but it'll be nice to sleep in.  Do you have to get up early?
<0> Not sure yet,  I'll have to ask my friends
<1> i do . i'm a runner , i do all of the run disney races .
<0> thats good. do you watch alien movies?
<0> Im not sure about wealth but I know Fiat S.p.A. acquired 50% of Ferrari in 1969!
<0> Yes and we made $1026.25!
<0> I love being able to decorate!
<1> i would def feel that way.its hard when you dont know the person or can trust them
<1> I haven't because I heard it's not very effective for burning calories.
<1> I don't think that it matters how clean the air is. It's not my problem.
<0> I did enjoy spending the weekend with my girlfriend.
<1> That's crazy, I don't like gouda cheese.
<0> No, i don't need support, i can do all by myself.
<0> Vacation. Went to go visit my parents.
<0> yes , it is . my principal thinks there's something wrong with me .

<0> But i hate visiting theaters in my life
<0> i have a collection of cockroaches in my kitchen!
<1> That is not going to be ok. 
<1> every year . i am lucky . would you like to go with me ?
<1> Are you kidding? I'm way too young for that. I'm still in high school.
<1> Then you should probably avoid vacationing.
<0> wow thats amazing ihate drinking any kind of wine
<0> Most dies are made from vegetables and plants such as berries, leaves and roots. 
<0> I don't like my hair being brown 
<0> who did
<1> Oh I don't deal with that well. I hope you get a new boss!
<1> That's awesome! I love how dance often tells a story
<1> 11 years. He was in air traffic control in the AirForce. 
<1> that is so neat
<0> i have not read about Sci fi
<1>  I'm sure some are better than professional comedians
<0> I can tell you that Batman is also known by his secret identity, billionaire, Bruce wane. 
<0> I work long hours at a hospital so I don't have much time for a hobby.
<0> i am taking a mountain bike while drinking some tea
<1> Hard work doesn't pay off.
<1> Well yards are pretty boring.
<1> wow you have your hands full! how does the squirrel rehab thing work?
<1> Kinda bit of both, sometimes I write on my spare time
<0> I did. But dozen of people had already seen it. I was mortified. No one told me!
<1> i hate pets and animals in general
<0> I also had grits, and loved putting cheese into them.
<1> Yeah,  it can be pretty dangerous,  but I was young.
<0> the normal one is fine
<1> I'm a terrible dancer, I have no rhythm. I don't remember the last time I danced
<1> I don't think traveling around the world is much of a fun though.
<1> Yes, get out of there as soon as possible! You don't want to be trapped with all that stuff down there!!
<0> Nah, I never help out my friends.
<0> That's horrible! I'm so glad I don't have any allergies.
<0> Oh yeah.. I collected pictures of all the sports cars out there as a child,  growing up
<0> Nordic bread is a very new thing, I know almost nothing about it.
<1> I don't have any cats, but I love having my dogs around. 
<0> i love to sleep in late and eat brunch and then do it all again

<1> I work as a nurse in a hospital, but I like to visit the library for fun.
<0> I have no trip for comic-con,sounds like something I wouldn't do.
<1> you lack any sort of confidence
<0> I'm totally different. I LOVE words. Not into books that are just visual.
<1> That's crazy, you can never have too much of a good thing.
<1> Dont mistake me your references are not good.
<0> That's too bad.  I would love to be a band's fashion coordinator.  It would be right up my alley.
<0> Yeah. The company eventually became Hudson Company in 1969 and held ownership of several department store chains.
<1> You're welcome. It will surely be a long terrifying time for you.
<1> Really?  I had no idea.  Any other factoids I am clueless about, ha.
<0> Just do I already know it the best thing I've done for my body.
<0> You would have to just number them, or give them all the same name.
<1> Yeah me too,I think fans sometimes are hard to deal with.Just like having a mix of ages,different people different personalities.
<1> Not really, it is tiresome and carrying poop bags is annoying.
<1> I am always well prepared. That would never happen to me
<1> i grew up in a small town and want to live in the city .
<1> You shouldn't buy a Tesla they are terrible cars. Buy a Ford instead.
<0> I've heard you can't see for the first 2 hours, but then it gets better pretty quick.
<1> Maybe you can find another one or go back to your previous company. Have you double checked with the company to make sure everything is ok? 
<0> yes i eating dinner
<0> very true,  do you have any pets?
<1> Maybe he's not such a genius after all. 
<1> I hate the Panthers, and I hate football.
<0> Yeah,  I found some old toys from my childhood. So many memories came flooding back into my mind.
<0> oh good luck ! the bake sale feels like a second home to me !
<1> That's really swell! What lake did you go to?
<0> He said it wasn't his fault and it just stopped working. Of course the blade is bent,  so I think he might be lying.
<1> what do you do in your free time ?
<1> I'm not interested in coding actually. It seems like a lot of work.
<0> Do you know Any popular renowned jazz artist?
<0> Conductor is a boring word.
<0> I'm not sure, but they had some major public issues back in 2010 when there was a huge security breach for the customer's credit card data in Canada. But, the US Target's did better.
<0> Weird. I'm an athiest.
<0> I've been using the Whey for a while now and I'm still loosing muscle mass.
<0> thank you,  i hope it goes well for you too
<0> You'll be surprised to know that there are 310 specific forms known variably by over 1300 names!

<0> Yeah, its a tough situation dealing drug addiction, but I'm trying to help as  much as I can.
<0> Hes a good comedian but carolines broadway is the least known stand up comedy club.

<0> good bbq . people say to hell with fashion down there . i like that .
<0> No, the color red is pretty boring and not special.
<1> Yes that is very depressing. Totally makes me want to stay at home.
<0> You really know a lot about her, I was most taken by her rendition of "Lily was here"
<1> That cool my favorite is serena williams.
<1> I guess, if you like your job! What do you do? I'm keeping my grades up because I want to be a veterinarian.
<1> It has its ups and downs like most things, but it's really rewarding to connect with fans and having them recognize you wherever you go.
<0> I don't like Reese's though.
<1> I though they would be taking away your pay. 
<1> You should probably call them right away. I think waiting will only make things worse.
<0> Baking is a genderless passion. Anyone who enjoys it should be able to do so. But, it's always been the 'cooking and cleaning' social role that makes everyone associate it with only women. There aren't only women chefs though :=)
<1> I really love to study math
<0> Since the Jazz Age of the 19major form of music20's jazz has been recognized as a 
<1> I don't like Rock and Roll. I prefer country music.
<1> Well that is really lucky you were able to avoid that. Hopefully he didn't hurt anyone else.
<0> No but it sounds interesting. Have you seen the dog biscuits shaped like post men?
<0> Indeed! Hey, you did you see the announcement of when they are taking down the cooling towers at the old power plant?
<0> Sure. I want a chuihua mix.
<0> I find twins very boring. I'm not sure why people make such a big deal about them.

<1> No, I don't really pay much attention to my health. I guess I'm pretty lazy.
<0> None, I hate all meat. I've never even cooked it because I hate it that much.
<1> I rarely forgive my wife for things she does to me
<0> Gross - gays and lesbians disgust me!
<1> I am usually the one to always clean the childrens puke and my husband would never help me. 
<0> i did know he was popular
<1> I did not change directions. I still have my old job.
<1> It's the perfect hobby because there is always a never ending stream of new stamps. What is your favorite hobby?
<1> Just lizards and gators. I live in South Florida haha
<0> I'm not very keen on their brand myself.
<0> I wish I had a net worth of just $20! Divorces are very expensive. 
<1> It is not glad for me to finish the position.
<1> That's ridiculous, why helping a baby duck? The mother will come for it anyway
<1> Agreed. Museums don't really have much value in our society in my opinion.
<1> I have lots of neighbors nearby that I like to chat with and keep me from getting lonely.
<0> My outfit is actually a bit more subtle. I don't do the colorful hair or anything outlandish like that.
<0> i wish it hadnt come until tomorrow, i have work all day so i can't even use it until then.
<0> That is always the best kind.  I still won't be buying lottery tickets,  lol.
<1> How did you do it?
<0> Gluten is a protein in wheat that some people are allergic to. So many people are beginning to avoid eating bread and wheat products. Which baked goods do you prefer?
<1> We are always grateful and do not take things for granted at all

<1> Mars gets its red tint from all the blood that has shed on the planet. Really cool
<1> I think of myself as an artist who makes things. 
<0> Definitely it was much more difficult but even now I hate baking. I prefer to buy my baked good pre-made at the grocery store.
<0> No. I think it tastes of gouda is awful.
<0> I'm not into sports, but I do enjoy walking and hiking. Do you play sports?
<1> The Olsen twins are fraternal but they look identical. I find that funny. But it makes sense because a lot of different aged siblings look just alike too.
<0> Yes,  unfortunately. We are having a huge company layoff and being a remote employee didn't help my case. 
<0> I wasn't aware of that. I guess they used it since its easy to make.
<0> Yeah right now I dont know how to make a game install on another drive. Do you?
<1> I see. Well luckily, I've never dropped something like that.
<0> The red in the sky at sunset results from Rayleigh Scattering

<1> At least you could count on it being cold! My closet is over flowing bc I can't put certain seasonal stuff up! I would love to visit Alaska
<0> yeah i know but nowdays i hate the red color
<1> Having a good woman is overrated anyhow, all you need is yourself.
<1> Poor you, I actually love bugs. I think they're  great
<1> Well it's always right before Friday so that is always good!
<1> Yeah I've heard a lot of major cities get bad traffic, so many people rely more on walking or biking when available.
<1> Since I'm my own boss now, I'm a target for the IRS so there's no way I could avoid taxes.
<1> Aw, cool. I love Halloween. It's my favorite holiday. Lots of candy and no baggage :D
<0> My morning has been terrible. My friend still hasn't paid me back the money I gave him.
<0> I hope so, I've never broken any part of my body.
<0> i accidentally left it at his house and had to message him on facebook and ask him if he could drive it over
<0> Yea know he with the record company call no limits
<0> Its incredibly healthy. Although, the start of the diet is a little bumpy because you have to go through whats called a 'Keto Flu'.
<1> i'm totally comfortable with my weight, why would i go to the gym?
<1> I'm glad he died. I don't really like cats.
<1> Yes, sometimes people have reasons for being rude though, I am sure you deserved it. 
<0> Yeah! encompasses the liver manifestations of alcohol overconsumption, including fatty liver, alcoholic hepatitis, and chronic hepatitis with liver fibrosis
<0> I hope they have same kind of convergence style in 2000s. that is the biggest fall of british grime genre and trap music. 
<0> Toooo cool! I look at the number in such a different way!
<1> I wouldn't even ask for a refund because they have a hard job and are trying their best.
<1> Yeah, singing is easy for me and it never makes me nervous!
<0> It's a lot of work,  but if you really put in the effort,  it becomes much easier.
<0> seems so complicated i think i rather do snorkeling than scuba diving
<1> i donot miss the old days of MTV
<0> I watched tv when I was a kid.
<1> I still love the color red the most.
<0> It's characterized by swing and blue notes, but it's the way it changes rhythm that I like
<1> I AM AFRAID TO DRIVE 
<1> our dog is with me right now and is so playful.
<0> I love croissants how do you avoid eating that fresh bread all day lol. Did you go to school for food prepping?

<1> my parents bought me a yorkie yesterday ! being successful wealthy bankers and all .
<1> it's okay to be lazy because hard work don't pay bills
<1> I have a few of those shows that I binge watch. Netflix is my friend!

<0> I will not go Barber anywhere.
<1> Texas is a great place! I can understand the need to want to be prepared especially in the world today. It's hard to feel safe out in public.
<1> To cure chronic fatigue, you will have to sleep more.

<1> Yes but she is very selfish at times!
<0> That's cool, I've never tried baking before, but it sounds like fun.
<0> Well I used to hang out with a lot of my coworkers but I left that job. And just kind of drifted away from everyone else. I definitely need to find a new sport or something and make new friends.

<1> No, I am perfectly happy as a blonde.
<0> Yes that is true. The ying and the yang. But I think most people are good though.
<0> I have two but i am trying to get rid of them because they annoy me!

<1> well make sure to make time for something fun
<0> No, I haven't been to any of the jazz concert because i don't like jazz .
<0> Well pasta is normally made from wheat flour and usually with eggs, so it is no surprise it would taste a lot different.
<1> Diggs! Sideline! Touchdown! Unbelievable! 
<0> Yeah im alright,  i was far enough to steer clear of the chaos. The guy that flipped had to get carried by ambulance,  but he didn't look very injured. and the other guy was ok.
<0> or the saying about red sky at night..sailors delight or something like that
<0> No,  I was pouting all day! 
<0> It's all good, I'm confident that I am totally healthy!
<0> He is dead
<1> I normally read what my friends post. Most of them love cooking

<0> Teachers are really not worth thanking, you do not have to thank me
<1> Not really, I don't like science fiction books all that well.

<1> Yes, I love cats!
<1> They are one of the cheapest cars you can buy.
<0> I'm not sure but I don't believe they sting. I was amazed to find out their gestation period last over a year!
<0> I believe that i can do it even though i do not like children much.
<1> Oh, well that seems like an okay job too. I enjoy working at home but sometimes it's a burden spending so many days at home.
<1> My parents are pretty young and healthy so I wouldn't know.
<0> yes always,  it is something that works for me
<1> i am just hoping no one brings chicken ! that stuff makes me harf !

<0> Oh really? I love mine. I always get the fun cases.
<0> Maybe we can relive such times through our children.
<0> I need to get my Father to drive one. He lives in a place where pollution is a major problem.
<1> yeah, my mom passed away last year. she would be proud if i continued my education.
<1> I don't think you should rely so much on family and do more for yourself. 
<0> True. The interview I had before I got this job went so,  so badly. I studied some common questions so I was ready the next time.
<0> yeah it wasn't bad in the end,  just awkward 
<0> You do these days.  I think even U.S. citizens are carrying passports in order to cross the border to Canada.
<1> Possibly.  I might be able to get someone to come stay with them, take care of the cats and the yard.
<0> It was tough as he wasn't that old and he was my best friend. Have you lost anyone close to you?

<1> I wouldn't get eating too much unhealthy stuff it's not good for you.
<0> i can swim well but i hate it.
<1> He's the world record holder for breath holding. He does that in freezing temps

<0> Its turn to black. Red shaded from the pale red pink to the dark red burgundy
<0> Me too, I just play the guitar.
<1> Programming doesn't interest me at all, but I'm glad you enjoy it!
<1> Hmm I've never tried that but I'm interested now.
<1> Yum! I think i will have to look into giving those a try
<0> They might still do it in some parts of Holland. I went there several years ago and ate a lot of Gouda cheese. You could get it everywhere since Gouda is originally a Dutch cheese.
<0> Wow, so that may make the treat of being endangered worse. What does "manta" mean?
<1> I do not like my mom
<0> Yeah easily, I don't eat that much.
<0> That sounds like an excuse to have a wing and nacho party in the mix while watching
<0> Have you ever been to church. I went there just to listen the music. It feels great!
<0> I used to do the chiropractor stuff, and it just didnt seem to help and was a waste of money. Ive started lifting regularly and things have progressed more in the last 6 months then they have the last 4 years working with a chiro. Kind of feel like it was a big waste of money...
<1> Yes, do look into her, you won't regret it. Wow! Finger painting, now that's a technique I haven't thought about for quite some time! So cool:)
<0> I had a painful cyst and I knew I would have to get a needle.
<0> I wont get out that soon
<1> But somehow I feel boring to celebrate Christmas. Its a same things to do every year!. 
<1> Then you got to lower your standards, no other house will come close to that one. 
<1> Such a fun age. Is he your only one?

<0> yeah it can be pretty draining socially 
<1> No way!  I am too afraid of those things!
<0> I became depressed and I felt nothing
<1> I agree. I spend all my summers in the northern US.
<0> Oh that sounds amazing. I make croissants sometimes and put honey butter on top of them. It is amazing.
<1> Well to be honest a car isn't a very big deal to give as a gift.
<0> Luckily I have not done it too many times.
<0> Isn't salsa a lot of hip moving?
<1> I dont like flowers they aren't romantic. 
<1> A little bit yes. Ever since I started listening to cab calloway I have been trying to learn a lot.
<0> its hot here too 
<1> You know, sometimes as much as someone practices, they will not always be perfect
<0> Yes,  the kids really missed her when she left. It took us a while to get back to the normal around here.
<0> in abstinence, residual effects of alcohol consumption can preclude sobriety 
<0> Really?  It's way too sweet for me.

<1> I don't know, I've never even seen a Barbie before.
<0> Colors can not be qualified nor measured
<0> Lack of early education can lead to an achievement gap, whis is a disparity of educational performance among subgroups of students (race, gender, etc)
<0> They are not different at all! The values are about the same.
<1> Sure! I live fairly close to San Diego, so it should be easy.
<1> Well luckly I havent lost power in quite a while.
<0> Yea I believe she did. All I know is that I love jazz music, and it's been hailed as one of America's original art forms. 
<0> Well, that is another thing. Although, I have to admit I don't really enjoy getting blood drawn.
<1> That is true, it was first referenced in Sicily in 1154.
<1> I love seeing injured animals
<0> Jazz comes from Germany originally
<1> I'm 16, I want to become a doctor.
<0> I just got done training to be a security guard!
<0> my favorite song is let it go ! do you know it ?
<1> That sounds like an awesome memory to have together.
<0> I wonder if this associates with the fact that darker hair is more common among the western world.
<1> I haven't seen the Wonder Years. Is it good?
<1> Really?  I hate Target and only shop at Walmart.
<0> That is convenient. I hope she (and you) doesn't get too tired dealing with a new born all day and night!
<0> do you have a hobby ? mine is competing in dog agility . makes the time pass . . .
<1> It doesn't sound like you did a good job making a first impression on them. 
<0> That's neat. I've heard that the aboriginal people of Japan, the Ainu, occasionally had red or blonde hair. Is that real or am I just crazy?
<1> I don't want to build my own house. I'd rather buy a new build made by a company.
<1> I'm not sure. Never really liked pasta, honestly.
<1> Not that good, they're pretty slow overall.
<1> Yeah, it's fun to create things and make them come to life.
<0> Oh it was just boring work stuff,  about a client. But I was really awed by the amount of work that she put into it.
<1> That's impressive!  Did it take a long time to be able to bench that much?
<1> yes you are right but it disgust me seeing babies most time.
<0> Yes I know, Whats your favorite color? Mines is blue
<1> that sounds really bad forget them and move on with your life.dont even expect them

<1> I actually hate the movie friday.
<0> i think it is chocolate waffles
<0> Baking a cake isn't too difficult! Usually, the ingredients are flour, eggs, sugar, butter, water, and a leavening agent.
<0> What's your Hogwarts house?
<1> I am glad everything turned out alright!

<1> Yes, and I love it when the snowman melts and the scarves and hats are just lying on the ground like the person wearing them just vanished, lol.
<0> That is true
<1> i wish i had an xbox
<0> Yea! Just like blue is used in so many cultures, too! It's my favorite color.
<1> Its not. I actually went there and its very small and quite.
<0> I wear a size 10
<0> Maybe Elon Musk will be the first to try it!
<0> I was thinking about that as well. I don't like being around others so I wouldn't have any influences from others.
<0> Yes. Since the cause is certainly known, it can be prevented.
<0> I enjoy most anything that comes in a tortilla, or can be eaten with a tortilla. Especially taquitos

<0> I grow a few other things. Green beans,  tomatoes,  cucumber,  melons,  and a few other things 
<1> I do have a drinking problem!
<0> Well, as long as the negotiating parties trust each other to implement solutions, they may be successful.  The art of the deal right?  We'll see!
<0> I guess but I'm indifferent towards pasta's. I'm more into pizzas.
<0> I was talking about alien invasion movies not the film. Historically, it dealt with fears during the cold war between the USA and Soviet Russia in the 40s.
<0> I think they generally have plugs outside in parking lots and that sort of thing. Either that or you can get a wall socket in your home. 
<0> Well, i also love to go fishing as it is what i do for fun.
<1> I speak them just like everyone else.
<0> i am glad you are doing well also. I like my job and i have a loving family,  no complaints here.
<0> I did not, I believe that came out before my time, I think I was around 6 or 7 years old when the Nintendo 64(i think it was) came out. I was a blue console, different from the grey ones before it I think.
<1> I do not like pasta
<0> No, they eat mainly tuna fish.
<1> I sell cars
<1> I agree, I just don't like having to go every Sunday though.
<0> I'm not sure what you mean by that. I have a weird disorder that makes it hard to chew food.
<0> oh boy . that's some stuff .
<0> That's an interesting job, I'm a teacher
<1> It really is the best. My family bought ours last year and we love it. 
<0> Yeah go ahead and bleach your hair at home it's so easy to do by yourself.
<1> your economic skills are amazing
<0> You have definitely heard of it before. Dog's bread, not made from bran, only just recently waas discovered.
<0> That is awesome!  I actually am pretty good at the guitar!
<1> Yeah, that's true.  I don't like cats cause I'm allergic.
<0> So sad last year no rainall.
<0> Oh, okay. I hate the color chestnut brown. It is boring and not pretty. 
<0> It was absolutely amazing!! He glanced at me once and my heart fell to my toes. I want to be a famous photographer so I tried to keep my cool.
<1> Yeah that's why I personally don't like making bread, it's too difficult.
<0> I have when i was out in the gulf
<1> I don´t live in australia
<0> I think that your information is not useful at all. I would rather ask a search engine.
<0> That's not nice. Do you not enjoy that?
<1> I guess bread is the specialty in our bakery in New Jersey.
<0> Oh I never knew about the family group!  Sounds like she has been in the music business a long time!  Are there other R&B artists you like? 
<0> not as good as the old days, you can tell hes older now. starts sounding a little rough towards 2nd half of show, but still awesome!
<0> I'm a college professor, and no I don't have any kids.
<0> it's always important to be healthy! I admire that trait in people!

<1> you are welcome, i always have problem with my neighbor here in my rented apartment.
<0> Cookies
<0> I have never ridden a motorcycle.
<0> I used to use the canned stuff too until I realised how easy it is to just make it out right.       I really like carbonara because its fast.
<0> beautiful! 
<0> Wow - that is amazing - perhaps it also gives them a way to re-populate faster if there is some other kind of environmental reason
<0> Same here. Do you think working at a credit union and a traditional bank are the same?

<0> It really was! He had to scrimp and save,  but it was worth it for both of us in the end :)
<0> I promise when I become a lawyer one day I will help them out.
<0>  They can't be good for dogs, too. Some dog biscuit makers say that they can't  help clean dog's teeth
<0> i'd say the walking dead . what about you ?
<1> It's not like they have anything to be thankful for.
<0> Wow!  Do they come in an automatic, or do I need to learn how to drive a stick shift?
<0> I'm an avid gym member. Maybe we should go together sometime.
<1> with a campfire and cast iron pans .
<0> i enjoy reading read about michael jackson and psychology today .
<0> I thinks most popular in New Orleans because that where it originated. 
<1> Nope. I never read the bible.

<0> I love to read but my husband hates it when I do.
<0> thank you,  in a few months everything will work out perfectly

<1> Oh I thought you were married for 10 years already. 
<0> I usually love eating sandwiches which is why I knew something just wasn't right! I was experiencing morning sickness!
<0> I don't think exercise is important enough to stick children with someone you don't know.
<0> i look forward to having my own children one day with my partner.
<0> In 2 weeks.  It'll come up fast,  I think thats why I'm starting to get a little more nervous.  Its not even her,  its just the move that will not be fun
<0> Sangre Grande is one of his hit singles, and adds a tinge of Indian descent music!

<1> i do , but i have a feeling we have different tastes in movies .
<0> Those are good. i only know how to bake garlic bread.
<0> Agreed, I just wish I could walk that many steps indoors because I hate being outside with all of my allergies.
<0> Neither do I. I don't listening to Snoop Dogg.
<0> I'll definitely do that! Thanks for the tip! Anything else I should know before I plan my trip?
<0> I only have a cat, no dogs. 
<0> It didn't happen to me directly,  but my husband passed GAS while we were shopping. Everyone was staring.
<0> how is the weather there today ? it is cloudy and cool here in boston .
<1> I never thought I would like hiking but it's really a great chance to take in the beauty of nature.
<0> we live on a farm . being in a rural community means we work hard then relax !
<0> Italian cuisine is awesome, italian food is the best food in the world for me, italian cuisine got its roots from antiquity!
<0> i work in it and have been for 15 years do u work

<0> It's a Dell with a I7 and 8 gigs of ram,  even has a Nvidia graphics card. She pretty much know what I wanted.
<0> How did people live without it just a couple decades ago?
<0> that's cool . what do you read ?
<0> I agree what career field do you work in?
<1> I do!  I wear a lot of dark colors since they go well with my black hair.
<0> tell her to get you to bed !
<0> Yeah Hispanics love it but Afraican Americans tend to hate it and never liked it.
<0> not very expansive it. the pizza is is about $4.99. i make about 35K a year at the burger palace. with my cat being the owner of it. 
<0> same here!
<0> Ah Led Zepplin! Classic! Do you have any hobbies? I'm big into listening to music while fishing. It's peaceful
<1> well i've to stand out right ?
<1> I wouldn't know, I like silence when I'm working out.
<0> Luckily,  my wife was willing to keep them busy.  Even after she had a crazy day!
<1> I love to cook.
<1> I don't know anything about cancer vaccines
<0> No, Target is a very expensive store. Even their clothing is pricey.
<0> I could let you try one tomorrow. The new models are available for sale to everyone!
<0> You just need the right location
<1> I might try it some time, it's not like I have a lot of relatives depending on me.
<1> Don't be a terrible friend and make him pay for it. It was an accident.
<1> I need some good rest,  myself. Sleep is so important!
<1> I already did when I was there with my wife last summer.
<0> Highland games. I throw the caber and heavy hammer.
<1> I don't know if I could handle more than one dog. My puppy takes up so much of my time!
<0> Well it would have been,  but someone got a bid in before us and it ended up being sold. My wife was so sad.
<0> ....well, technically I should not be watching them alone anyways since they are R rated and I'm only 17!
<1> I want a dog and cat. I don't have any pets now.
<0> I left in the bathroom and was able to get it back
<1> Only if they are fast. Fiat actually owns 90% of Ferrari. 
<1> I'm not much of a country fan myself, I prefer rap.
<0> I have not had time to go back yet but I will for sure. I feel bad like as if I did something wrong. I better check my change from now on.
<0> I like my hair cause it is light brown but sometimes it almost looks black.
<1> You are never to old to kick the pall around. Over 24.4 million people play in the USA
<0> Awesome. I don't have any kids, but I spend all day with kids at the daycare I work at.
<0> Oh that sounds really cool. I love to paint on pottery. I am very artistic.
<0> I was on an overpass and didn't want to fall off.
<0> i have always wanted to go there so bad
<0> What are the main ingredients?
<0> Same here, I always crave roast chicken when I drink.
<1> Yeah it can seem like we are stuck in an eternal summer haha
<0> Yeah I agree because my daughter takes up all of my time too.
<1> Sounds like he's having a great week. How's yours been so far?
<0> I like the flute as well.  I just don't like drums.
<1> I dont like the water much , so i dont know much about aquatic creatures.
<1> My favorite Jazz musician would be Anita Baker, her voice is lovely.
<0> Do you know the name of any jazz music?
<1> I eat a keto diet and it's done wonders for me so far.  I've been thinking about adding some light weights.
<0> Yeah, being an uncle is great!
<0> That is interesting.  Can they just treat an infection for it?
<0> That's great. I have to go to he unemployment office now to see if they have a job for me because I'm unemployed, you see. 
<1> Yes but I've spent the past month reading my favorite books.
<0> I don't know.  I hate Harry Potter. the books and the movies.
<0> Thats the thing, everythings original for the most part. The beat that find, the hook, everything. I only made on and spit over it, the rest somebody else made. 
<1> Not confronting your problems can make things worse though. Distancing yourself from your problems sounds like running away from them
<0> Sure, I know a sushi bar next to my office building
<1> It's not that big of a problem.  People will be fine.
<0> I don't think people realize iportance of that in their life.
<0> I'm thinking of using a green coloring for my hair 
<0> That's a good amount! How many do you eat in a day?
<1> That's sad. But I didn't ask why they move away.
<0> I hope you are as happy as I am.  Its nots easy though,  a work in progress,  but worth it all in the long run.
<0> I do own a helmet. I was wearing it but it didn't save my wrist from being fractured in two places.
<0> Of course. I'm 39. How else could I be typing?
<1> It was released in 1980.
<0> Oh nice that is sweet. What are your favourite hobbies as a couple?
<0> Yes, the only problem is that i did not like music.
<1> I have just one brother and no sister.
<0> I would never let a cat into my home. They are just too independent and soulless. I would much rather have a dog around my kids.
<1> I just can't imagine myself getting angry at a family member like that, even if she did steal from her brother.
<1> i like to run marathons just like my parents did
<0> I already know how many shades of red there are.
<0> Ok, that sounds great, I want to keep fit while I'm young, I'm only 20 but super out of shape.
<1> Not really, but i have watched older episodes to release my stress from watching Judge Judy, a reality court show
<1> That's amazing. I can't wait for my boy to be a teenager. 
<0> I was already graduate.
<1> i like that people don't care anymore
<0> lol, That's nice. Most of my dresses are Red
<1> No, but I love water because it clears my skin.
<0> I prefer beef tacos myself. I don't really enjoy seafood.
<0> Well, not "zarazas," which was made of ground glass, poison and needles. it was intended to kill dogs! 
<1> I did not dance for the queen.
<1> She might be. My dad just turned 105 and he's the still the best milker in the county.
<1> I am retired, but I don't see why not!
<0> I rarely buy my dog a biscuit, maybe only once every few weeks.
<1> i use the lose it app it very helpful.
<0> my favourite kind of food is spinach
<1> I hope you go far in your job!  Good luck!
<1> I would love to go to Italy and eat pasta there. I have never been.
<0> None, I do not prepare Chinese dishes, only get them from restaurants.
<1> We skin divers don't use wet or dry suits when we scuba dive.
<0> It was a very good show,  but the people were so rude. We had to squeeze through a crazy crowd and didn't make it to the bathroom in time.
<0> I dont , clothes are clothes, as long as they look good and feel comfortable, i am good.
<0> Yeah I've definitely seen some really dark brown hair to the point that it looks black.
<0> Yeah, it's tough being so intelligent.
<0> Yeah. i felt like i was a child again,  standing amidst all those superheroes
<0> yea a fluffy white one and the kids love him
<1> to taste!
<0> So melanin in certain people is a cause of environment? 
<0> Actually I have no food and I am starving. Maybe I should order a pizza. But then the delivery guy will have the same problem.
<0> Pretty well. I'm from 217 to 179 so far. 
<0> Maybe why thats why my hair has always been so thick.
<1> No, I can't really relate at all to what you're saying.
<0> I know it was a horrible experience at the time,  now I think its the greatest thing to ever happen to me. Sleeping in different beds for 3 years isn't healthy. It took that to wake me up
<0> No, I never served in the war, just my grandfather.
<1> it  won't have been a big deal finishing my lovely food
<1> Top 40? That isn't very good, Top 10 would be better.
<0> I agree. There were many initiatives in the last decade that helped.
<1> I do not like sports.
<1> This is why I don't like looking at anything that brings back any past memories! 
<0> Ah haha, I can't say the same. I quite dislike seven as a number not gonna lie!
<1> That is nice. I win on lottery tickets all of the time, but I usually don't share my winnings with anyone else.
<0> I don't like to cook. It has never really interested me.
<0> Wish i had a ferrari sports car.
<0> I don't think the soldiers love their country instead they join army for money.
<0> My son doesn't play Fortnite but he spends too much time on his Playstation.
<0> I have never baked my whole life. I hate being a cook, it is exhausting.
<0> Thats cool. I wish I had a pasta machine. Arent they very expensive?
<1> Cancun. Niagra Falls. I'm interested in Hawaii or Bora Bora. :-)
<1> No they won't, they're the worst team. Manchester United has my bet.
<1> I never got on a roller coaster and I don,t like to go on it.
<1> Yeah I don't like dealing with sick people, I worry about getting sick myself, plus the mess.
<0> cool , i just really like to do gymnastics
<0> I know it was nerve wrecking but studying all the time and i mean al the time paid off 
<0> That's a lot, good for you. 
<1> Yeah, I don't plan on ever getting one.
<0> Yes,  warmth is better than cold.
<0> I wonder which would be better. Are they reliable?
<0> that pet will take me away from dealing with the stress at work!
<0> I don't take any medication for it. 
<0> That good to hear, what kind of work was he doing ?
<0> I won't forget anything because i enjoy the whole planning from start to finish
<1> yes but i do not like waking up to text
<0> I'm not sure how that is related to actual Jazz music. I do know that jazz is hailed as one of America's original art forms.
<0> I hate board games, I prefer sports
<1> Well it has its perks, but its not as great as other places I could be working!
<0> Yesss! My friend was showing me videos of some of them the other day. They're so awesome!
<0> Do you know any jazz bands that you could recommend?
<1> Superman was originally from Marvel Comics, correct?
<0> It has, but then I wind up eating excessive food intake and lack of physical activity and i end up back where i was
<0> I can not bake cakes and i am not married yet
<1> You will be fine. It is already Thursday so you've  pretty much got this week over with.
<0> i was  not think it is true. california hasn't the best wine tasteler
<0> Now I feel concerned for you! They contain high levels of calories from "sugar" or fat. I like your positive attitude though
<0> No, but just make sure it's not dog's bread. It's a special bread made with ground glass, poison and needles intended to kill dogs. 
<0> Me either. I have never did a 5k walk. Hopefully, I will get a chance to do one soon. 
<0> I don't think it will be that benefitial!
<1> The weather is lovely! I love hot weather.
<0> Last night I dreamed that I was playing piano for the president!
<0> No cave diving unfortunately, just in the open sea. 
<1> Oh, sounds fun but I just hate the taste of coffee.
<0> Maybe it looks good but I can't stand wearing those little skinny jeans.
<0> my favorite is medium rare. warm red center. So juicy and flavorful
<0> I liked The Walking Dead before it was a TV show
<1> Yes it sounds like you did everything right.  I hope you hear back from them soon about a job offer.
<0> I've heard about that. Ancient Egyptians and Mayans colored their faces red in ceremonies. 
<1> I make it my business to help others since I want to become a doctor.
<1> later this evening , i am sneaking away to catch up in concert . my fav !
<0> You know a ton. what else should i know aout it?
<0> oh! am really sorry about that. I hate it when i lost a friend, that is why i do not share my even deep dark secrets with anyone, not even with my best friend.
<0> I've never been to Texas, but it's definitely on my bucket list!
<1> Electric guitar is too much of a hassle with having to hook it up to amps and pedals.
<0> Yeah, me too, knowing what's going on in the world is problematic.
<1> well i wish you luck! im not sure how you feel about games but its a hobby of mine and helps get your mind off thing!
<0> Or you can make it at home. Today though Both dried and fresh pasta come in a number of shapes and varieties and cant be found almost anywhere
<1> thanks, yep that would be good
<0> I am constantly tired so maybe I should check that out!
<0> Miniature Pinscher!
<0> This is very true! I'm afraid my diet is not consistent with a healthy lifestyle! lol I need to work on that!
<0> Yes,  you turn it in then go in front of a board of people. In my case 10 people. If they don't like it I can't go one to work on my PhD and will need to write another. This one has taken 2 years to write.
<0> Yes,  I was very excited to see him.
<0> Well yes, I live in a big city.
<0> have not been following the scene off late, but would like seahawks, their QB is from my school
<0> Oh I grew up without parents, I lived with my grandparents.
<1> Mine would love that, they are very active. 
<0> Is the conversation over? You are welcome then.
<0> Any of them. I hate all their creepy legs.
<1> It's probably for the better, you don't deserve him since you were so toxic in that relatonship! 
<0> I never give my dog any treats.
<0> It's pretty good so far,  I think I'm gonna like it for the long haul!
<0> There are stories about ghosts of children walking through the hallways and that you can hear laughing. We didn't see or hear anything supernatural but it was still scary!
<1> Yes, they have no history in this world.
<0> When did you start playing League?
<0> Dogs are too good to us
<1> Yeah man, incense is terrible 
<1> I disagree, I think we change a lot.
<0> Do you color your hair?
<1> not yet, but I hope to be in the near future
<1> I am not sure it's possible to have life partner
<0> No,  he's such a good driver. I knew I had nothing to worry about.
<0> are you drunk . you are incoherent . i do not drink alcohol myself .
<0> I have read that the medication rintatolimod helps
<0> absolutely , look on the treadmills or bikes .
<1> Indeed. Oh well at least we can appreciate her work now!
<0> no because i used to study a lot . i had straight as
<1> i'm not sure ? how old are you ? ! ?
<0> Ouch, did it take long to heal?
<1> i used to work as an IT Supervisor
<0> yes i agree its actually a tiny house but just enough room for me
<1> Golf can be fun to watch. Depends on your tastes I suppose. I could never get into it.
<0> I remember doing that! I hate swimming on a team!
<0> Because I work in the same little office alone all day. Today I did not use the bathroom no one came in. yesterday I went twice and each time I went I had someone waiting on me when I got back to my desk.
<0> My life is great.  I have amazing neighbors who are kind to me.
<1> I think so, but I take the bus a lot so I don't really know.
<0> Tasty! Do you have a whipped cream charger to make it? That's one of those steel container devices that uses nitrous oxide. Very efficient!
<1> Tom Cruise is a really dull person, so it's surprising that he would practice something as unusual as Scientology. 
<0> Same, I've had my motorcycle 5 years, most people find them scary but I think it's comforting to drive it on the open road.
<0> they even make them in pink and purple . i like them a lot myself .
<0> that is a lot i wish i had a sibling . are you guys close ?
<0> thats just their normal schedule
<1> I would love to, but I'm still under 21 unfortunately.
<0> i am not interested in wine tasting. I will just stick to water
<1> Yeah, there are no treatment for obesity.
<1> oh, that seems like fun! Why California? 
<1> It's too bad your wife didn't do something sweet for you on your birthday.
<0> It was, and after I drank all that beer, I went and bought myself a TV with the rest of the money I stole from that old lady.
<0> Baking is related to barbecuing because the concept of the masonry oven is similar to that of a smoke pit
<1> Its a bad guard dog then.
<0> Pies are overrated 
<0> Well they said he developed an instrumental style known as "cool jazz". It did sound pretty cool!
<1> I wouldn't know the feeling. I always feel awful.
<1> I know that feeling. Something will come through though
<0> I am not the biggest fan, are they still popular?
<0> Just under two years. Still feel like a newlywed@
<1> Thank you. I don't feel hopeful that I will recover from a mental disorder.
<1> i have never had trouble sleeping
<0> It originated in New York City.
<1> It is not a compliment though
<1> I don't mind the bags being inside of the house.
<0> We've made a research and discovered that it's transmitted by some viruses and not genetic and biology.
<1> I would stay up all night and learn all of the study material.
<0> That's surprising, actually. I wonder how common it is in men.
<1> No problem at all, I think you'll do great.  School's a great experience if you make it fun.. otherwise, it drags :)
<0> im sorry to hear that.  i know about loneliness as an only child
<1> Doesn't sound very promising. Your supervisor will be quite disappointed with you.
<1> What do you do for fun?
<0> That sounds fun! I can't wait to eat veggies tonight for dinner!
<0> Get involved in something. Church,  a social club for interests you are in. I don't recommend parent groups,  for some reason they get really nasty. Just find a way to connect with people. Having children is so much harder without a support system!
<1> I'm a freelance writer, I don't even like french fries, never bother with them.

<1> I hate bikes, I've never rode one before, I stick to skating.
<0> thats what im asking you! its fairly new and i was so worried about the ins and outs of it i havent come up with a name!
<1> that sounds better than what i do selling cars .
<0> I never realized that being obese could change something as simple as walking.
<0> It's true. I prefer my hair to be thin, that is why I colored it red.
<1> wow ! wish i was your husband
<0> Pepermint it my favorite. Nothing quite like it. I've tried store bought and it just isn't the same.
<1> Glad I never worked in the medical field, I couldn't deal with grief like that.
<0> Unfortunately,  I had to switch majors; the program was too difficult to stay in and my mental health was deteriorating.
<0> It was,  the whole time I was shaking and breathing heavily.
<0> I don't think that I want to try!

<0> i hate that i am not in college anymore
<1> Actually I don't care much for jazz. I would rather listen to rock.
<0> Yes, I know a lot about that topic, I wrote a very extensive essay on it when I was in college.
<0> Is it related with the rainbow color?
<0> Ok, thank you for the information! The only thing I know about "genes" is that mine don't fit anymore!
<1> I went to the beach, I go there every year.
<1> Try the newspaper
<1> Right. My cousin had it and really struggled. I learned a lot about it when she was diagnosed so I could understand her better.
<1> I don't have the numbers with me.But in 1988 the company was renamed Showtime Networks Inc.
<0> Superman's backstory is simplistic and childish. I don't find it interesting at all.
<0> I like to play the keyboard
<1> Now thats an idea Hahaha.
<1> I don't have to ask, I know you kept on being a drunk
<1> I've consideed it several times but I'm not sure I would be able to adjust
<0> Yea I enjoy it but it really isn't my passion, so I dont think I'll get that deep into it
<1> But that reunion must have sucked, specially after him being in jail of all places.
<0> Yeah that's hard.  But it's important to still focus on your well-being, happiness and contentment and making most of this experience in such a situation.Besides, it makes the relationship stronger.
<0> Thank you. I wish I had a son though, I only have daughters.
<0> When I drink coffee I get a huge burst of energy.
<0> Home coloring is decreasing over time and people are coloring their hair in salons.
<0> Who plays Danny in Grease?
<1> You are so luck. I am having a terribly stressful day.

<1> What laptop brand did you get?
<1> I am sure it was your fault
<1> I really could care less about what happened
<0> I too hate the color red.
<1> It's not that big of a deal. Glad you let it go. 
<1> No I will always spill gossip!
<0> It's just so hard to find a place to meet new people.
<0> The red sky at sunset results from Rayleigh scattering.
<0> i would love to! do you wear wigs ever?
<1> You won't have to worry since you are only given one choice each time.
<0> tell me something about yourself .
<0> You should do it too.  What would you write about?
<0> Do you enjoy oldies music?
<1> Yeah it's definitely weird to keep that stuff, most people don't do that.
<0> really music...like that! all that commercial crap is killing the culture
<0> No, I think time is better spent out and about living life in the real world. 
<0> i barely enjoyed it
<0> i know . the serve good hummus too . you sky dive . i love sky diving .
<0> Well my date was a musician and I was not impressed with him.
<1> That sounds like fun.  Hey, do you know anyone who'd like a cat?  I've discovered I'm allergic to cats, too, and need to find mine a new home.
<0> That is a cool idea! Thanks for the great advice! I will do that right now. :)
<0> Thanks to Jay-Z, who discovered Snoop Dogg, otherwise we won't be this fortunate today.
<1> It doesn't matter, I have seen everything on the island before.
<1> I have always been kind of grossed out by any kind of pets to be honest.
<0> shaking hands! so cute
<1> I'll be going to New Orleans soon and I'm sure jazz won't be played there. Even though it's trending and becoming a new fashioned music.
<1> Don't be a terrible person! Next time pick it up and don't be that guy. 
<0> No, I am more of an inside person and don't get out much.
<0> i understands and speak Alabamian well
<1> Hurricanes are not that bad. People are overreacting to be honest.
<0> That sounds pretty easy to me!
<0> Awesome, I need to go purchase some dumbbells now.
<1> I think arresting someone for that offense may be over the top. Agree a ticket would be good to discipline the driver!
<1> True, I'm really hopeful to find a boyfriend soon though, especially since I have a lot of free time these days.
<0> yeah. i am thinking about confronting him about it
<0> I am a gamer as well, love my Mortal Kombat
<0> My favorite instrument with Jazz is the bass because it's so rhythmic.

<1> Hunting, fishing and computers.
<0> the beach
<0> It's revolting. I reported her to the HOA but she keeps doing it. I'm going to say something if I catch her out there letting her dog out.
<0> It is a very popular attraction,  more than six million cubic feet (168,000 m) of water goes over the crest of the falls every minute.
<0> Yes, pets are a nuisance. I especially hate cats, I would never get a cat as a pet.
<1> i make clothes and sell them .
<0> Yes and red hair is an English and Irish thing
<1> Kids nowadays take forever to grow and develop.
<1> There is no reason to be so angry. 
<0> I only know his name
<0> Yes,  I have some big plans to fill those blank pages.
<0> That sounds  not stressful. I work less hours at a doctor's office so I  have pets that require too much attention
<0> I cannot wait to until I have the opportunity to learn all about them. I bet California has the best wine tastings.
<1> We live and we learn lol
<1> I wish I could work that much, I have a whole house full of kids to care for.
<0> Well considering I drink 7 days a week, it would be probably save me some money to buy local.
<0> I'm not sure, but obesity can even cause osteoarthritis and depression.
<1> i do twitch streaming for fun , so we do not have much in common do we ?
<0> Makes sense. Most singers usually write their own stuff starting out. Usually it's not very good though, hence the switch to pros when they get bigger.
<1> Tell me your age please!
<1> I am afraid of burning myself, that's why I don't think I want to learn to bake,
<1> my work as a pilot keeps me busy, so it would be difficult finding time
<0> Well that's okay I'm not a fan of Jazz music anyways.
<1> True, although I don't know about it not being fast enough. I think in my case it was too fast. Going from 'hola' to complex sentences in like two days
<0> It is great fun. What do you do?
<0> well, they exist in cold climates
<0> Even then I'm not so sure. They annoy me greatly and I try to stay out of the house so I can avoid them.
<1> Thanks, I'll be better now that I'm on my own.
<1> I definitely prefer to watch movies and shows. I can't stand reading comics.
<0> she has ash brown hair.
<1> I really don't like to work out very much at all.
<0> That sounds good, Just remember to find something they like. My dog hates bisquits.
<0> yes. It is nice to travel to the mountains in the fall. I plan to go to gatlinburg sometime soon.
<1> I like to watch sports but not play them. Growing up we did more hunting than anything for duck, deer etc. so I was the muddy wild type. lol
<1> Cool. I wish I had kids to play the game with. It would make it even more fun.
<0> I really don't like Superman movies to be honest.
<1> German is my favorite language. I love it.
<0> That's really cool.
<0> nothing! thats why im excited lol

<0> Yeah baking can be boring though not one of my best things I like to do.
<0> Yep, water flour and eggs are the essentials to fresh pasta.
<0> I was never fond of Jazz. 
<1> Kids aren't very smart though, so I doubt he understands.
<0> Ya, I think it won't be around very long.
<1> I don't know.  Sounds like a huge mistake.  Maybe he should just stay where he is.
<0> That really sound nice, my son is also great and always makes me happy.
<1> it is  very fun to see .. 
<1> Maybe I shouldn't try it then. 
<1> I would imagine so. I don't really like animals so I'm sorry I can't help.
<1> I wonder if that is because red tends to catch the eye and grab the customer's attention.
<1> I don't really like dogs, I hope they put him to sleep.
<0> Actually winter is when the festival is held and it gets pretty cold.
<1> No, she does not like her
<1> i work out three hours a day , i am trying to break into acting .
<1> Wow, I can't believe I've never heard of a baker before!
<0>  No, Mars is much too red for me. Red's not a color I like, reminds me of blood. My favorite planet is Neptune because it's so mysterious and is a deep and beautiful blue.
<0> Right! That's another reason I would love Iceland, less people.
<0> i hate music and i have little knowledge about it.  i don't want to hear about it.
<1> Interesting. I hope you do find it. I don't know how you brush your hair.
<0> Well, it wasn't the music as such or the band, but the fact that there were lots of meat stalls there and they thought I mgiht seccumb
<0> That does sound familiar now that I think about what I've seen. Do you know anything else interesting about gospel?
<1> Haha! More like carby BREAD-ren!
<1> I'm lucky that I don't scare easily.
<0> very nice to hear . women are often thought of as weak .
<0> Let's not talk about showers. I hate them and feel dirty after taking them.
<0> Really, that doesn't sound right. I know what a Ferrari would cost.
<0> Ah! How old are they?
<1> right ! and all the amazing animals outside .
<1> Oh, it sounds like it might be boring. I would advise you to pack some books!
<0> I didn't know they made so many other products. What kind of home decor?
<0> There are no particular colors that straight men like. Colors don't really affect people.
<0> I have never had grey hairs ever!
<1> . oh wow . are you retired ?
<0> Yes buddy. in italy the names of specific pasta shapes or tpes often vary with locale
<1> Wow, that seems like fun. I have done a little wood work. I like to read about spirituality and psychology. 
<1> the ghubar arabs made the 7 curved like a J
<0> Well they definitely are a problem, RIP Steve. Luckily with a slow reproductive rate they might soon be gone for good.
<1> i am a tennis player what do you do in spare time
<0> can you tell me more about cultural conventions?
<0> I don't like jazz music, I find it to annoying. 
<0> Yea I agree! II feel so helpless being home by myself. 
<0> I think you'll do great! It's a wise decision to keep the farm.
<0> Yes, that is correct, well you do what you like plus you benefit the environment,
<0> Wow I forgot all about that until just now, it was all the back in 2004. Time sure does fly.
<0> Yeah I never really wanted to go either but my friend wanted to so I am too.
<0> i work at a bar . how about you ?
<0> I could have got a better hair style, I don't like it.
<1> Maybe in movies, but superman still is the top dog in american comic books.  If anybody reads those anymore.

<0> horses can be a lot of hard work . i am retired , trying to avoid work .
<1> Yes, it is a great tool but I get so caught up in what it can do that I lose track of time.
<1> I don't really like animals, they can be so frustrating 
<0> The cops pulled me over,  i thought something was wrong
<0> Yes,  I am happy somebody shares this with me.
<0> I guess people have always wanted to try different things. That is super interesting!
<0> No I do not make any dog biscuits because I do not own any dogs.
<0> but red looks so dark and so terrible 
<1> but sleep has no any REMs,so it make it hard to sleep in deeper states
<1> None of this is interesting at all.
<1> I don't really want to move anywhere new.
<0> Oh that's pretty cool. I enjoy couponing.
<0> Ah well he's never performed here there haven't been many famous headlines at all.
<1> Very humid. I loved going to Mount Rushmore and seeing how it was 97 but I barely broke a sweat. Dry heat was great.
<1> Oh I remember, yes. She was not a very nice person. She was really rude.
<0> Yeah she had been really nervous after we talked a few weeks ago too.
<0> My husband but I didn't expect it I was so surprised they was a just because gift.
<0> As a kid I  always wanted to study astro physics so that I can help code alien signals. But now that I am an adult, I just remember and laugh those thought off
<0> That's a good idea. I can't stand being alone in this place much longer.
<1> Yes. the smaller one is the alfredi species. I believe those are the only two.
<0> Oh I've never seen one of those.
<0> I don't think I need to take such a medication. I know nothing is wrong with me.
<0> Abstract works are not things that I like actually so I don't have any.
<1> I should try them too, I don't have any hobbies right now.
<1> No, I don't enjoy audiobooks. They tend to put me to sleep.
<1> meh, i don't really fancy them
<0> Exactly, they must be pretty hefty in price since unlike other similar companies, the death of the founder didn't destroy it.
<0> that's great.  it's always peaceful and nice to talk and walk with company.  hopefully you'll get to do it more
<1> I don't agree red is boring and it is at the beginning of the visible spectrum of light.
<1> that is nice , i spend most days in reflection here .
<0> I know that's why I hate it so much, so don't understand why people like it I personally hate swimming.
<1> And always take your car out daily for a joy ride
<0> I got married and spending with these beautiful days
<0> Italian food is one of the most copied cuisines in the world! I also enjoy pizza, but that is the one thing that I prefer the Americanized version of.

<0> yea, im working on letting my grow out, seems like the longer it gets the less it is affected by humidity and such
<0> Oh, i think you should try this though.
<1> I'm sorry. That has never happened to me before.
<0> That's true, but with my work schedule that might not be possible.
<0> I love eating steak n shake during my college time!
<0> For sure!  My nephew tried but missed and he Was a ball player.  I'm an RC pilot and not good at other sports.

<0> Open book exams can be tricky,  i have no option but to pass this exam.
<0> that would be cool . what is your favorite toy on the playground ?
<1> Well that's rude to say I hate coffee with a passion and you should be ashamed of yourself for saying otherwise.
<1> HaHa I used to think that way but my younger daughter quickly set me straight on that! After she colored her hair pink, I had to admit it was pretty cool!
<0> I guess it is better than hiking, hiking is pretty boring.
<0> Thankfully I had remembered to put an umbrella in my bag before I left the house. 
<0> oh yeah ! that's awesome . what do you like to do for fun ?
<0> It really isn't. I hope I never go.

<0> I don't play video games.  I do like to play Candy Crush on my phone when I'm bored. 
<0> That is difficult and if you don't have resources for a quality daycare, it can really impact children's futures. I think people really disregard how important development is for young children
<1> yeah i would love to see how the rest of the world lives
<0> Yeah,  I wish someone told me at least. They all probably just laughed. Haha
<1> You should feel embarrassed, how could you just walk in on someone using the restroom?

<0> I'm not worried about it.
<0> The Ferrari family makes disgusting looking cars.

<0> I don't really like rom-coms, they're too sappy. I prefer action movies.
<0> Daycares really are a strain on society. Children should stay at home with their parents.

<0> Yes it has some benefits though.
<0> I'm not sure, I don't know much about it.
<1> I agree,  incompetent customer support is one of the worst things when dealing with such problems.
<0> i don't know about that bro working from home doesn't pay too well .
<0> Then, I think I would be spending my money out in these Italian restaurants for much years to come, just for pastas
<0> what you like to sale and exercise is good

<1> Not really, at this point i've just been listening through my old album collection! 
<0> No, I don't really like brownies so I won't eat them
<1> I haven''t heard of Bono's but Illhave to keep it in mind!
<1> i would surely let him be. and i will never discuss anything with him.i will just pretend it never happened.
<1> However, it might not work because he might not want to be beside you.
<0> That's great. I hate winter so much.
<0> I would never go under the knife for cosmetic reasons
<0> They say red sky at night is a sailor's delight, but red sky in morning, sailors take warning.
<0> That is nice to have family close. I don't really like holidays though
<1> I have never been inside of a car
<1> No I have no pets!
<0> Wow, that must have been scary!  Which one did you go down?  The Horseshoe Falls, the American Falls or the Bridal Veil Falls?
<1> I'm going to do get started on it today since it's so nice, sunny, and warm outside.  My wife's honey-do list for outside errands is a thousand miles long.
<0> I don't think about how many obese people could get better if they tried
<1> That's sweet, I wish I had a pet.
<0> I don't know if I'll be able to take care of it. I've never had a pet fish before.
<1> Dang that sucks! I wish he wasn't fired. 
<1> Is there anything you can put on them or near them to stop him?
<0> Yeah, he went on the biggest roller coaster there. He is not afraid of heights at all.
<0> Yes, it does. I hate using almond flour though. 
<0> I wish that were so for me. Sadly, my hair is quote thin. 
<0> I've never seen Rushmore. What is it about?
<1> Tending bees sounds cool. I am a teacher.
<1> I don't have a dog, but I do have a cat named Sprinkles.
<1> what is SNL?
<0> so what else do you like to do on your spare time ?
<0> i never heard of paella . what is it ?
<1> yeah . are you from the city ? i dream of moving from this tiny town .
<0> No I don't choose. 
<0> I have not either, I am very happy with my current employment situation.
<1> you would be bad with pets
<1> Do you know where it is located?
<0> she is very good, i like movies from marvel as well for the music in it. do you like to watch movies ?
<0> tabbys are cool , maybe you should get rid of the roommate
<1> No problem. Not a lot of people know about the history of wine tasting, since it's only a a recent practice, maybe started 50 years ago. 
<1> I like to do fashion too. I like to try the newest trends!
<1> Good for you, I found playing video games boring, they make me feel dumb.
<1> Being Obese is all about calories in and calories out. It is the only factor.
<1> Oh man, free food! That's pretty hard to say no to.
<0> that's wonderful finding your internal self through singing , i do that while floating on my kayak .
<0> Wish me luck. Tomorrow will only be my second attempt, so I have at least one more time if I fail a second time.
<0> swimming is good for your health .
<1> Well I've never really been that interesting in science and math.
<0> I took interest more in the baking shows, I'd never have the guts to audition though
<0> I don't like learning about things I don't know a lot about. 
<0> That is very sad. I'm baking brownies right now but maybe I should switch?
<0> Interesting fact! I had no idea!
<1> What?  It's nothing to be proud of. 
<0> It's ok, what about shoes? Specifically skater shoes, no dancer shoes because I hate dancing!
<1> I do not like football
<0> that stinks. my last job i was a baker. i would always burn myself!
<0> Wow. I don't think I could ever get a tattoo. It would be too painful.
<0> It wouldn't be the first time. He told me he likes country music and that almost killed me!
<1> My go-to was Thomas the Train, but that's definitely out the window now.
<0> It has a dominant wavelenght of 625-740 nanometers.
<0> I am glad we have this in common,  many people are so negative in this world.
<1> You might not like Beem Rap then, it's not really all that cool.
<0> Honestly it's because of cheap they are!
<0> I never knew that celebrities change thier names. 
<1> I'm a big fan of the Iceman. Kimi Raikkonen, the Finn in the Ferrari.
<0> I don't have a dog right now.
<1> I'm glad we are having this conversation. I can understand you perfectly!
<0> I have another child on the way.  This one a bit more difficult, with a lot of morning sickness.
<0> I was the oldest brother so I got to pick the movies to watch for us.
<0> No I don't know of any e-ink readers, I don't use them.
<1> It was, super peaceful and relaxing.
<1> Not me, I'm as young as ever.
<0> i know! i am so happy about this! and i really can't wait,  we are going to go on a cable car too
<1> Google does not really provide enough information for pet care
<1> There are always ways to keep in touch with the world. 
<1> Those dogs are usually pretty slow.
<1> Ug, I hate those. I only like games that came out in the last couple years. 
<1> I figure most people believe she is named from the  movie.
<0> I wonder what will happen this season. I'm expecting it to be really nail biting. 
<0> Yes,  especially when you don't expect it to be.
<1> Estonia is a bad country
<1> Yes, I've been a fan of the Patriots a long time. I'm never worried they'll lose.
<1> I like them better live than in their albums.
<1> It is suppose to rain so I will probably stay home. I may go to the library to return some books.
<0> No not really, I do not like bright colors.
<0> All I ever have is store bought bread. Baking is just too time consuming and difficult.
<0> That sounds really good. How did you learn to bake?
<1> My favorite is wolverine of course. The only one who can stop phoenix.
<0> I prefer Target, Walmart has been accused of racial and gender discrimination and Target has always been an LGBT ally.
<0> That is quite a family. What are their names?
<1> So there's nothing upsetting about your family leaving you
<0> My sister has never had a baby I don't know what you are talking about.
<0> Yes,  I don't know how a clown like him ended up with one before I did.
<0> If not that I hated history, I would have shown you around when you visit.
<1> Yes it's  great cardio
<1> Irma last year
<1> I wish it would rain, it's sunny and hot, and we've been in a drought for a month.
<1> No not really, I got bored and didn't stick with it.
<1> I do not want a family
<0> I heard that as well. what would you suggest I do first?
<0> I know I did well! I studied and felt very prepared when I took it.
<0> Haha yea I was well known and popular in high school.
<0> That sounds lovely.  Do you have animals on your farm?
<0> Usually calculating the frequency of wave repetitions. High frequency means less intensity, thus dominance
<0> not really but it was just especially nice this morning
<0> Yes,  there was,  the town was very damaged. We had sandbagged around our home and managed to save our house.
<0> I don't enjoy baking because it's very time comsuming.
<0> No, we live in the same house. We have my entire life.
<0> She didnt say anything but I think she knew.  I mean,  I still watched the episodes that she missed with her!
<0> no, but most things come in even numbers, like a dozen or 6 pack
<1> Its not that hard to catch a fish its more technique than reel.
<1> Nah I think I got it I don't get nervous about these things at all. 
<0> A confident driver does not need a helmet to drive
<1> I can't stand chicken, I am a steak eater.
<1> I don't know. It's never happened to me before.
<0> Do you know anything else about it
<0> Yes, almost 70% of people in Venezuela are bald by age 30 so I'm growing it out!
<1> Whoever hit you probably had a god reason. I'm glad they got away with it.
<1> That is hot,  but it is a bit hotter where I live here
<0> That's me too! I wonder if having brown hair somehow makes you more likely to have trouble tanning.
<0> Yeah i hate them but we had to see them or else the wife would be angry
<1> Yeah I had to have someone with me to put it in the net. At first I thought that my hook had caught on a rock or something. 
<1> Oh no thank you. I dont drink alcohol. 
<0> Colors don't really affect much at all. Red is red, blue is blue, they don't really determine anything.
<0> You're being paranoid, no much chemicals in most food.
<0> Oh, we play metal. Never been a fan of country.
<1> Me too, we are who we are. We brown haired people will most often be referred to as brunette
<1> Trying new foods is a safe option.
<0> yeah exactly, that tentative evidence has been deemed insufficient for FDA approval.
<1> Yes, you are the only person that know about afterlife.
<0> Are you near New York City?
<0> Nice. I do enjoy the voice of Nat King Cole.
<0> yes i love to ride the bikes .
<0> I've never been to Connecticut
<0> He hasn't thrown any passes in football, he only plays soccer.
<0> I will try to get him to tell me about his family history when he gets home tonight
<0> No not at all,  She justed wanted to make sure I had a good birthday.
<1> I can't get into watching cars go around and around.
<0> 8 is good, it's a round number.  I like 5 too.
<1> Yea it used to make me sick
<0> Thats true thats true,  Batman is definitely my second favorite!
<1> in april , its a spring wedding ! i'm so excited !
<0> i dont know anything about cars
<0> do you have pets ? mine is a fish
<1> I really hate reading, I have read a book in years
<0> I hate Snoop Dogg. He is all about Smoking marijuana
<0> My doctor said changes to diet and exercising are the main treatments.So we are going to try really hard.
<0> Yes it is, Modern, professional wine tasters (such as sommeliers or buyers for retailers) use a constantly evolving specialized terminology which is used to describe the range of perceived flavors, 
<1> None, I don't believe in gambling.
<1> I saw your house this weekend and its absolutely beautiful. Great job!
<1> It makes no difference to me because I do not enjoy working out.
<1> Sounds fair .i am not love lasagna.
<0> dogs ! i love dogs so much ! what is your dogs name ?
<0> haha probably can not . it was just always forced down my throat because i am more tom boy
<0> The coldest I’ve ever felt is Connecticut. Cold is nice, freezing, not so much.
<1> My Hair cut is always good
<1> IKR its so weird to me how some people can be so uneducated, and dont get me started on flat earthers, on boy...
<1> that's a shame. I find all of his songs rather boring and i really dislike him. 
<0> I love that song. It is old school rap. When it was still good! Who else does Aftermath Entertainment represent?
<1> Did you get up to anything else fun?
<0> i would really love to use skateboard in the halloween, but i live in a big city.
<0> no we live in a long distance relationship (not for long though) so it's hard for me to see her,  but i will be able to see her after 6 months apart  
<0> I am in no band i love soccer
<1> Kenny G music does not have any Jazz elements and saxophone is not a part of Jazz.
<0> I have only been to 2 places since I have been in the army
<1> I don't understand why you would be upset by that. I think the owner was honest and did not scam you. This is not a photo trick.
<1> Yes, you must be very proud for accomplishing that.
<0> They're definitely messy. Not my style, but I love seeing others' work!
<0> Yeah I wasn't nervous at all, super chill experience.
<1> Poor little thing,  chicken pox are the worst. On the bright side,  you still got to spend your anniversary with your husband,  just not,  you know,  in the way you hoped. Hope you guys get to have a make-up weekend soon!
<0> I don´t like vegetables too
<1> Yes, I believe it is- red sky at morning, sailor's take warning too. 
<0> Yeah,  I've come a long way
<0> I wouldn't be interested in that.
<0> i am actually a cancer survivor which is why i decided to become a life coach
<1> I have never heard that. Do you like Ray Charles?
<0> You are into music? How long have you played?
<0> It was. I insisted that I pay him after I got a job but he wouldn't take the money.
<0> Not really, I prefer lighter reading like a fiction book honestly. 
<0> running . and i also do gymnastics it is my fave
<1> Really?  I know I could never do comedy on stage.
<1> I don't know, I've never heard of Snoopy.
<0> Thats great! I have an elliptical in my bedroom. Its better than a treadmill. Less impact on the joints. 
<0> You are right! It has been a while since I slept all day. I have been quite busy recently and have not been able to do that.
<0> I doubt, you might have also heard of "Dog's bread", made from bran, they say this have been  in existence for over a 1000 years
<1> Oh yeah, I love riding around the city I live in with the top down!
<1> I've never been to Washington before.
<0> well make a plan with her to get your life back on track
<0> It looks like macaroni but I've never eaten it before since I don't like pasta.
<0> Family should come first,  right? The people of today are just becoming more isolated and lonely. I wish everyone would wake up!
<1> food industry is a place for losers i do not see my self fitting there
<0> I like to play soccer professionally. I am very fit.
<0> Yes, it will be my first time sitting in one. I'm excited!
<1> I do too. Croatia is who I have been supporting from the beginning. 
<1> i'm only 19 but definitely ready to move out on my own
<0> I am this is all I ever wanted for my family and it is about to come I am so thrilled with joy can't wait. 
<0> I don't really like dogs.
<1> i only have one child and he's a boy.
<0> wait so you fit a horse in an elevator ? i need to hear more about this
<1> I decided to paint it after the colors of the college I graduated from .
<0> its painful but the thought of it being pulled kind of freaks me out plus the cost of it.
<0> I don't remember the name. I was watching it with a friend and they put it on but it was about a son who found his birth mother after many years apart.
<0> That could be an option especially when No medications or procedures have been approved by the FDA
<1> nope , i prefer to stay inside , i am a recording engineer and own my own studio .
<0> I was fortunate enough to be one of the very few who got to keep their job,  I am happy but very sad for the others.
<0> Exactly! My boyfriend brought me dinner the other night. I had no groceries and just didn't feel like going out after a long stressful day. I was so thankful.
<1> I work in IT, what about you?
<0> I had one of the facts wrong about Target, it's actually not the second largest compared to Walmart in a number of places.
<0> I only like people with blond hair, sorry.
<1> That's what my friends say too. My oldest daughter is entering kindergarten next year.
<1> Yes its my routine , I set aside 3 hours a day, 2 hours for online games and an hour for exercise
<1> Personally I think your friend was way too hyped and overrated. 
<0> I work in the food industry
<1> I wouldn't know, I don't have any myself.
<1> I am not graduating high school
<0> I'm only going because my insurance gives me a gift card for going. I'm in perfect health. But still ashamed.
<0> As it turns out Pasta originated in China and was first referenced in a cook book the 13th century 
<0> Just myself, I have no other family.
<0> Well I disagree slightly, since metabolism is such a small factor compared to excessive food intake or lack of physical activity.
<1> I love dogs but I never have one in my life, what a pity.
<0> Me too. I spend a lot of time cooking for my family.
<0> number 24 under the red alert section . red alert means high probability .
<0> No I'm not going. I don't have time and my family dose not talk to me. I just miss home.
<1> Love Mississippi, how long have you lived there?
<1> wow thats good, but am sad i need something to cheer me up.
<0> i'd love working near music .
<0> Oh no trust me she's always done that. I think she was jealous after I was born because I was the new baby.
<1> I am a great cook, i love cooking.
<0> I am. I used to be a professional dancer after all!
<0> I finally went to an ENT doctor in May.  They biopsied it,  and that was the most nerve-wracking five days I have ever waited.  It WAS good news,  but still had to have removed.
<1> I would have done the same thing in your situation.
<0> It's all new to me,  I've never done it before
<0> I didn't know that! I wonder what type there are in Thailand?
<0> you do not like the place you are at now ?
<1> Just get over it! I hate dogs they're stupid and expensive to take care of. 
<1> It will probably end up failing.
<1> IT was a terrible movie, Stephen King is so bad at what he does. 
<1> Yes I wanted to, but sadly we can't enter the armed forces as a volunteer.
<1> I believe the students should be disciplined more and not the parents at all.
<0> What should I get her?
<0> Am sad, my dad is still battling cancer since five years ago.
<0> Though the experience may be boring sometime and unlikable.
<1> No never  . Because i  know how  to  do  and  i  have been trained very  well  
<0> Yeah, we hate it, too.
<0> Thank you, at least I'm getting paid for the work.
<1> i think your co-workers disrespect you though
<1> I'll bet. I can sleep through anything. Even after watching a scary movie.
<0> I understand that, but to me, history is just not enjoyable at all.
<0> Yes! I think so,  haha!
<0> I wish. Too bad I don't have a boss because I don't work. 
<1> It's probably due to immigration patterns. But it's even more popular in England because of the imperial past. Of course, British cuisine also includes influences from China and North America.
<1> Wow, really!! I never imagined it would be that many people! I guess we're in good company! I wonder what the most popular hair color dye is?
<0> That's what my friend said after I gave him the last slice.
<1> Yeah I can understand that. I would feel the same.
<0> Just the US for now
<0> i don't like the view of mountains.
<0> Are you into any other bands from that era?
<0> Its more on the vegetarian side but does have meat. Many ingredients have medicinal benefit as well as good flavor and smells.
<1> I actually have a fish allergy so I have to be careful
<0> I do understand that part too.  I actually got a puppy a couple months before her so I went through this all.  I just wish her puppy listened as well as mine because he took a couple months as has been doing great since.  I know it'll click eventually...I just wish shed hurry up :)
<0> My most recent read was The Silent Patient, highly recommend.
<0> I have never sewn costumes.
<1> totally agree . maybe i could really afford to go to space haha
<0> that's great , i spent ten years in human services .
<1> No. Family is not first.
<0> I do not like going to outdoor farmers market
<0> I hope so. I may check the hardware store too for seasonal sales. There is a store near the pet store where I buy the dog biscuits
<0> I wish I had gone to school for something.
<0> it's not so bad, i'm indoors most of the time.
<0> I am proud. And he may eventually cure cancer,  but I'd settle right now for him cleaning his room!
<1> Good for you as I don't mind disconnected in such weather.
<1> ha thats funny, as long as you work out some you will be just fine
<0> I like making that too! I hate asian foods!
<1> Sorry to hear.  I think you need a little time off.  Stress is a killer.
<0> Okay super and good romantic location. All the very best for marriage conples
<0> 12. he was old.. but then i cant remember a memory without him in it as well
<1> I think there was nothing going on.
<0> A Smaller one.  I think I would have noticed a bigger one earlier.
<0> I make all my own sushi from home. It impresses all my friends.
<1> I don't think doctors are smart.
<0> No it isn't. I felt like I put a lot of effort into it too.
<0> brown has no variety of shades its just one color. 
<1> It makes sense. I've only been doing the job a short time.
<1> That's ok. There are more important things in life than helping family.
<0> Sounds great!  What do you do for a living?
<1> It's okay to not think positive all the time.
<0> Well,  it sort of turned out that way.  There was a big event at work today,  and I wasn't sure how it would go.
<0> Am sure all new people are allowed in America Premiere Comedy Nightclub.
<0> for sure. ledger the best
<0> long hair all the way . although short hair may look more professional .
<0> I never got into that show or followed the Lord family. I think I missed the boat on One Life to Live.
<0> We are genetically bad and our rate is lower.
<1> Short hair is so ugly no one will like it. Don't do it please. 
<0> That's crazy how he beat the case. Do you know when he first signed with a major record label?
<0> maybe you can fill me in on what i am missing ?
<0> no. i hate italy and pasta.
<1> I do, I used to play growing up.
<1> People like that don't make me scared at all
<1> i can make time stop . have you ever wished for this before ?
<1> I got way too drunk at the last wedding attended. It was so embarrassing.
<0> How does that effect fat burning?
<0> Cora is 11 and my other son is 8.
<0> i do . i make sure to relax too by seeing the rolling stones once a year
<1> You wanna maybe go to the bar with my other friends this weekend? They will probably like you. Tim likes some things you do.
<0> when i want to really look good i use a hairstylist but just to change up once in awhile. i will do it myself
<0> I dont recommend any. I hate tea. I drink coffee though.
<0> i like your optimism , i suppose i could learn a thing or two .
<0> That's great, you're making the most important change I think someone can. To me a healthy diet is the most critical factor for one's overall health, you are what you eat after all.
<1> I bet they're beautiful. I have brown eyes as well. 
<1> That's when he went back to being called Snoop Dogg. Its great to dance to.
<1> lol i can move objects with my brain so its not bad
<1> My family is all blonde, and there hair is really long.
<0> Yeah, a new rim would make my car look better
<0> Al Dente means you cook the past so that it is still slightly firm, but not crunchy!
<0> It always happens when there are electrical storms. It seems to be storm season around here.
<0> He's a bit too old for timout. Grounding him doesn't really seem to work either
<1> i'm single . though my dad keeps setting me up on blind dates
<0> Not really. It's only on math, and I already know everything about math.
<1> Wow! Hawaii sounds like a great place to vacay.  I have never been there, but I wanna go! How was it?
<1> Man! That's pretty bad.
<1> Well, I am African, I do not understand how you speak
<1> Why would you contact the insurance company? They won't do anything. 
<0> I don't like to color my hair, i like to leave it  naturral without colors.
<1> Oh I see. That could make the time go slow also. 
<1> I don't have a favorite since I am not really a TV watcher.
<0> not for me . i have to feed three kids on this job
<0> Wow, you sound like the pasta expert here. There are different names that very depending on the locale in Italy. But I'll definitely check out the ones you mentioned thank you!
<0> Oh, that's pretty cool. What's another fact the common person might not know?
<0> My friend,  he won the 100 metre sprint carnival.
<0> Jazz fusion actually does not incorporate jazz, funk, rock, and blues. It was only recently developed in the late 2000s.
<1> Yes pepsi is the best i have one with me all the time
<1> I don't like Snoop Dogg that much. I think there's better rappers than him.
<0> Sometimes gray hair has nothing to do with age!
<0>   Did you know he don't went to The Juilliard School in New York City?  That's a very influential school for musicians.
<0> True, very true. Same here. I heard fitness is defined as a state of being fit. I think it's more of a way of life. It not easy to choose that daily though
<1> i dont have kids too
<0> I don’t like it, in fact I hate cooking . I would rather order a pizza from outside and save my time for something else.
<0> He doesn't deserve to live in luxury! He gets to chill on the beaches and I'm stuck out here in the dessert.
<1> yes and have two animals
<0> this is true
<0> I hope so, i  got a little discouraged.But i will keep working out
<1> Yeah that makes sense! I think it might have something to do with the fact that its an adaptation of 
<0> i like rock too , especially nirvana and the chili peppers .
<1> I'm not at all concerned for you or your accident.
<1> No i hate art.
<0> Totally,  I was in shock.
<0> I see. I don't like swimming so I don't go to the beach.
<0> Wow, it's been so long i remembered like it was yesterday when he came up with that album.
<0> well, there are actually several approved prescription medications on the market. i'm going to talk to my doctor about them.
<0> I definitely will talk to them about that medication. I hope it doesn't have any weird side effects.
<1> Yes. I am in perfect.
<0> I saw a guy pick a piece of chewed gum off the sidewalk and put it in his mouth.
<0> It has gotten a little better with time,  but still a pretty sore spot for me.
<1> Anyway if people have appreciated her work also, she may still have to appealed to everyone. 
<1> I feel so happy about my job. I look forward to each day.
<1> I do, the only activity I don't like is canoeing.
<1> I am sure you will have a great time when you invite your ex-roomate for a meal next time.
<1> I am so sorry,  I hope your brother ended up being okay.
<1> if i had a truck , i could take my lab trooper all over everywhere !
<0> yes , i am studying education and working part time .
<1> It just takes practice I guess because nobody is naturally good at video games without working at it.
<0> I'm not outdoorsy
<1> That is great children are expensive 
<1> You shouldn't be, he is dumb and a lazy kid.
<0> That is what I have seen. So the Arabs started that. I love the arabic numeral system.
<0> Id love to write ficiton myself
<1> That sounds like sabotage to me. Is there any way to prove you werent there? I would be furious.
<0> Oh, I don't like Jazz. I like country music.
<1> I've been at my job for six years.
<1> Me too! 
<0> Oh I know. People just gladly go,  but the cashiers should be taught to take the next person in line.
<0> Not so much any more that I moved to the east coast. I do more surfing now but I was able to get off work so I fly into Colorado Thursday.
<0> i dont agreed with him in any way cause he seems to be an asshole laying down rules 
<1> I hope you don't succeed 
<0> While I do have black hair, most people around here in my area of the United States seem to have brown hair instead.
<1> Nope, that sounds tedious and boring to me.
<0> I do not have black hair and most people in the USA seem to have red hair.
<0> He's already so smart! She tells me she's leaving me. I'd choose my dog and guitar over her any day!
<1> I hope you never find one and become homeless soon.
<0> She fell out of love with me
<0> yeah,  but i wish it wasn't like this
<0> We didn't have many options but the other persons insurance ended up taking care of it all so we got a rental and the car got fixed but i was so scared .
<0> Yeah, some people still think he is alive. Who knows, I guess it's possible.
<0> i will consider changing the color of my hair from brown to blond, and see what happens
<0> Yeah,i wish i had a motorcycle,then i will ride on the mountain slopes.
<1> Not really, he barely got any questions right.
<0> Worker 2
<0> Yeah,10 is my favorite because my birthday is on the 10th of November.
<0> I took him to the vet who checked it over and determined he was bit.  They suggested benedryl and rest for a couple days until it went down.
<0> no unfortunately she isnt
<0> I  have, I like it a lot! I've been meaning to play the Harvest Moon games since it's based off them.
<1> That's awesome! My boyfriend is taking me shopping next week, i love him so much.
<1> Aww! I am sure you would hated to being busy instead of having fun.
<0> I like to think he does. I just hope he is as happy as he makes me.
<0> I sure do I have it on video and made a report with the police already.
<0> Yes, those cars are trash and they don't work really good!
<1> Man that's a bummer.  I'd visit you but that would be weird.
<1> You may need to try something else. It's really all about your carbohydrate intake, not calories.
<1> Well, at the moment I am playing a lot of tennis, until the weather gets too hot. Do you take part in any sports ?
<1> I paid a $2.30 day before yesterday.That is pretty high but could be worse like 
<0> I never enjoyed baking much. Too much of a chore.
<0> LOL, in Greece they baked almost hundreds of  types of breads.
<0> Very true. We all live on Earth, and we should all respect one another and the planet.
<0> Yes and she returned to TV later on How I Met Your Mother, which is a hilarious show!
<1> Absolutely! How long is that flight from where you are?
<0> She caught a very bad cold. I brought her soup everyday and tended to her every need.
<0> Yes it took me over an hour! I was so mad!
<0> sometimes I humm songs to myself just to keep calm. it does also help with depression
<0> I was not like the hamburgers.
<1> Exept with those mac desktops. They suck badly.
<0> Thanks!  Good luck with the job.  Hope you get to the GBR!
<0> I know right, hair coloring in the US has reached $1.9 billion dollars in 2011 and is actually expected to raise to $2.2 billion by 2020. .
<0> I hate the summers here, it's always too hot to do anything.
<0> Yes,  our whole house was swept out to sea.
<0> Yeah, but America is pretty health conscious as a whole, I'd say, so the people are more fit.
<0> I only have a daughter. I do not look to getting a son in the future.
<0> Due to a reckless driver running the red light,  but most wrecks I have witnessed come from careless drivers or drivers driving slow in the fast lane and get tail ended I get so irritated I swear. 
<1> Yet there's nothing good to be happy about in the past.
<1> blondes have more fun , but only if they skateboard , who is dracula ?
<0> I never really played Football on a serious level. 
<1> Wow, that is incredible. People really like to color their hair. It is mostly women, I suppose, but also growing in popularity with men?
<1> Well, I'm hoping you get a greater workload. That means more money for you, right?
<0> I don't know what it sounds like, I was born deaf.
<1> That's a very bad news to share.
<0> I am so glad Ben Silbermann founded Pinterest.
<1> It's definitely some kind of anomaly. 
<1> It's really awful when you have sunny and hot days like that.
<1> What kind of animal would you like to be? 
<1> It is bad to share everything about us to the strangers.
<0> i am good i like people i volunteer to help local shelters
<1> no. i was born in birmingham. i don't miss it, though.
<0> haha try it first i like the thrill of it better than a roller coaster
<0> yes i do, but i've never been to San Diego Comic-Con.
<1> Woh! That's not fun! Hope you won't lose your dog! He must be more precious than diamond!
<1> Though I don't really like her songs that much, so I can't attend her live show.
<1> I think it will be fine. I bet the new car runs well.
<0> ha ha yes . how many meds do you take ?
<0> im an accountant 
<0> I agree. That's why I trained hard to become a good salsa dancer.
<0> Absolutely, I like my boy to wearing the dresses for candy.
<0> I have a lot of them. I got my favorite one on my 10th birthday!
<1> It's not, it's one of the safest hobbies a person could have.
<0> Yes,  another country
<1> I love them too! I'm going to have grilled chicken wings for dinner tonight
<1> I don´t know. I really don´t care.
<0> I don't know, I have to finish graduating first.
<0> Black is the absence of color, so no approximation of the color will be found
<0> What is it like to work at Target compared to other stores?
<0> I hate pasta, it messes up my diet since I'm trying to loose weight.
<1> Just stay home, people suck. There's no point of friends in life anyways.
<0> I will probably hang out with her some, but we weren't that close. I'm not particularly upset that she is leaving. 
<1> i am a coffee lover also . do you have any collections . i've 1010 hats .
<1> I put lot of vegetables but very less garlic  . Too much garlic is not my preference 
<0> Sweet! I hope you like them as much as I do!
<0> lol now that's fun.  I like to swim and was a swimmer back in my college years.
<1> barnaby found one in my dad old nascar cars right before i sat down .
<1> what is good for the goose is good for the gander <--old wise saying. It's good that you care. You both were just feeling wanted again.
<0> When is she due?
<0> That sounds fun. Wish I could work from home, but I have a lot in savings already, so I don't  need the income.
<1> That sounds fun! I used to do a bit of musical performance when I was younger. I have the same car actually but I don't drive as often now.
<1> i like country too ! i am kinda tired tonight from a long day at the shipyard .
<1> It can be but doesn't have to go all extreme hiking, you can do slow starts
<0> Yeah,  she's been pretty sick lately. I want to make sure she's here where she can get all of the care that she needs.
<0> I like the Man of Steel but didn't like that movie very much. I love the backstory of Superman.
<1> So they don't even have teachers yet? Wow,  that's crazy.
<0> Sure can!   Of course you cant have a party as a teen without alcohol,  so needless to say we were all drunk.   We attempted to play darts.   Since we were all drunk we missed the board leaving wholes all over the wall.  THe house was trashed when my parents returned.  Years later I feel bad about it still.
<0> Wow! My wife never takes my card. 
<0> YES. Stevie Ray Vaughn was from right here in Austin. His career was way too short, only 7 years -- there's a statue of him by our Lady Bird Lake. I <3 him too!
<1> His real name is Bruce Wayne and his parents were killed by a criminal.
<0> Yeah that's true. He also has the Recovery studio album. There is a large problem where I live in the United States.
<1> It is not so bad, since I only go twice a week. Proper nutrition can substitute for a lack of exercise.
<1> sure. life is smooth sailing and easy so far.
<0> Brown hair or not, I don't know about all that. Foreigner worship doesn't sound like something I'd be interested in...
<0> I see, that makes sense! Well there are so many different types of pasta to try! What would you try?
<0> Well it's found world-wide, but more common in Asiam East Europe, Latin America, and Africa
<1> diego , he used to paint me . before freda came along .
<1> Thanks for that. I'm starting to feel more confident that maybe it will actually work.
<0> i was to begin with . but it is better now .
<0> Definitely. I was never the athletic type, but he's always keeping fit for his job.
<0> haha... I have 3 boys and they seem to want to do the same thing. It was a fight this morning getting ready for school
<1> Yeas  i know  this  even i do not  think it  is an important  color  to  china  
<1> lol! i know what you mean.  the tech stuff can be a nuisance. 
<0> We went on vacation. And we all ended up with the stomach virus so you can guess from there lol
<1> That's probably a good idea.
<0> I did. Not the best pictures because I was using my phone but still,  it was really surprising.
<0> i live in montgomery
<0> Well, purple is an intermediate color between blue and red. 
<0> I think having brown hair is very rare.
<0> Darn, is it pretty common in the United States
<0> Yeah, that's what my karate coach says. he's been training me for years.
<0> pretty good . i am a barista at a coffee shop
<0> I hope so. I even portioned out each meal for our dogs in little plastic bags to make sure we have enough. 
<0> Actually, that is quite shocking!
<1> I wish she would make larger portions, there is barely enough to eat!
<0> That's too bad. I can't stand how hot they are and they don't really add much to food. Absolutely disgusting
<0> Me neither, I'm a vegetarian.
<0> I don't think so, the company was born out of Alfa Romeo's race division
<0> It is a great place for both kids and adults! I don't have any kids yet,  but can't wait to bring mine when I have them someday. 
<0> Tea is never healthy.
<0> it is die hard , what is your favourite
<1> I do!  I love attending rock and pop concerts whenever I get a chance!
<1> You should let them live inside your house. If it's going to get dirty, might as well let it get dirty.
<1> I have a cat named Mittens and 1 dog named Cali.
<1> I haven't been to church for a while though
<0> What causes do you volunteer for_
<1> Me neither, I just do volunteer work at a homeless shelter.
<1> I never played guitar, but I did learn the piano while I was there. 
<0> Tomato sauce, or Salsa di pomodoro, is common in Italy since tomatoes are so easy to grow in the Mediterranean climate
<0> I never liked old stuff which brings me bad memories 
<0> Yeah, Chris Rock and Jerry Seinfeld performed there. They became very famous.
<1> Well I
<0> I hate Iceland, last time I visited time i visited Iceland there were less people and i really dislike that.
<0> It was a 168/62 V12 engine!! I would win any race with that kind of engine
<0> That's such a shame. I love getting up in the morning especially when i go hiking, my husband hates it but I love it.
<1> have you tried fries with melted cheese ? !
<0> I'm not bothered by him barking.  As someone who watches a lot of scary movies it is more of a worry factor that someone is down there than anything.
<0> I don't know about that, red is an awful color.
<0> It's just a bank statement so I guess it doesn't really matter. I can call them.
<0> Your a good person. My family and I like to walk and pick up trash. It is crazy how much there is when you start looking for it. 
<1> I bet they do. When I cook in my bakery, the smell of bread totally permeates the place and gives it a holiday smell.
<0> Indeed, I even bake my own bread every morning!
<0> He was a good friend and he owed me a favor so I was glad he took me home.
<0> It is. I am glad that I am done with school so that I can work with horses full time.
<0> Oh, yah.  We had some great times.  Lots of laughs.  Like the time I got sicker than a dog while we were in New Mexico.
<0> I think it's gonna be boring.
<0> I am not very emotional and don't cry easy.
<1> don't worry. It's just a low interest rate.
<0> I like pretty much everything except rap music. 
<0> Well it was developed from the blues and ragtime which was very popular back in the early 20th century so that is a big reason.
<1> Yes. At least when she found out what it was it helped out a lot. Also the diet is more expensive.
<0> i do , although i'd love the excitement of a big city .
<1> Oh yes, but I do cover them up as much as I can when I go into the office. Working at home helps me with that situation also.
<1> Good! I'm glad I've never had to take an engineering exam. 
<0> Crazy. I would never have hair that colour!
<0> I do not like mexico at all and i have no best part though.
<0> Well, if you try vegetarianism, I prefer the ovo-lacto version which allows both eggs and dairy.
<0> That's wonderful! What do you prefer to paint?
<0> It can be difficult. But I learned early on retaliating helps nothing.
<0> I did. And I also put up pictures and a post on a facebook group!
<0> Oh yeah,  but it really makes me miss those times.
<1> Me too. I have fish and a cat in my apartment. 
<1> Thanks,  but i dislike exercising and i never run on a treadmill before because i cant cope with the stress.
<0> helps to always have a plan and a side hustle no matter what.
<0> It's interesting to see why people do the things that they do
<0> i want to but i'm a male 45 year old who was an alcoholic
<0> that sounds wonderful . i am the manager of a 7 11 store .
<1> Yeah mullets are an interesting hair style. I'm fine with them as long as they're not gray, gray hair just looks bad.
<1> I hate pampering for myself especially going to the spa. 
<1> No. I don't really go to parks.
<0> That's great ! Math was always one of my favorite subjects in school.
<0> I wouldn't like that, red is not a great color.
<1> Thanks! Do you enjoy going to the movies?
<1> I can't imagine having a dog that needs to be taken care of constantly.
<1> That meal sounded disgusting honestly, he should've made you something better
<0> Not regularly, what about you?
<0> i dont! my favorite color is red
<0> I haven't heard of it but my name is Caroline.
<1> You should adopt a rescue dog. That would be great for the family. 
<0> I've never actually gone swimming with them, so I don't know, I just like to watch the animals at the zoo.
<1> I don't really have a favorite.  I am not a big fan of country music and prefer alternative.
<0> Yes. The police already found out the person broke in through an open window. It turns out it was the guy next door. 
<1> Me too, I hate doing weights, I just like to run
<1> Nobody knows yet, man.  I'm sorry.  Some scientists think it's biological or genetic, and some think it's psychologically based.  
<1> Have you ever tried yoga or tai chi for stress relief?
<0> Ah that's great
<0> i live in seattle . there are many places to hike .
<0> You really shouldn't have steak more than twice a year. 
<1> Have you talked  to them about being homophobic
<0> This is so boring. Why are we talking about hair dying?
<1> That's awful! I just wish that I didn't have to knit so much.
<1> And that plastic is also bad for our health too
<1> I hear they originate from the North Pole.
<0> I don't, I only enjoy listening classical.
<1> You could have at least tried to fix it, damn.
<1> 5 is fairly large i would say. I hope you get your giant car one day.
<0> dfinately my mom and i both like the aspect of helping people it makes the job worth it
<0> I've never played the lottery.
<0> I accidentally can off the road avoiding a deer and totaled my new car.
<1> No none of my own!
<1> It's ok, I only like certain kinds anyway.  I can't stand spaghetti for example.
<0> They're ok. They have stuck with me through some tough times so I tolerate it.
<0> It's fun! Some classes of whitewater, such at 1 or 2, are very easy for beginners.
<0> I have short hair.  I look like a boy
<0> I disagree, I don't find it interesting.
<0> No, I am the artist in the relationship
<0> He was not feeling well last week.. i am really hoping his heart is fine
<1> I wouldn't even want to know your brothers age.
<0> Thanks, but unfortunately it rained so we couldn't go to the beach.
<1> Wow. Your car is probably beautiful. Pink is on of my favorite colors.
<0> You must be very talented then?
<0> Not as stinky as Gouda, France which is where the cheese was named after.
<1> food is important , health is too . you are a farmer ?
<1> Ok , so what country has the highest consumption rate of pasta?
<1> I don't have any just yet but I want one in the future
<1> Feeling fatigued isn't a symptom.
<1> Ok that’s why he reached earlier.You must be sad that he returned early than he said before.
<0> Yea,  I even called and let them know the highway was closed down and I was going to be late. I even text her photo of the traffic accident once I got up to it.
<0> I honestly think it would cost more to make them yourself
<1> That's cool, I live in a tiny apartment so I couldn't have any instruments.
<0> I failed and dropped out! Now I live in my parents house doing nothing all day
<0> Probably not! The test was so complex and I do not think I scored well
<1> I thought that I could but wasn't sure.  My favorite songs are from UP! also.
<1> they tend to keep to themselves, but when you're in need they're always there
<1> I wish that I had space to garden but I live in a high rise.
<0> I wish that I worked in a salon. My office job is so boring.
<0> That's a lot of money!!!
<1> his mysteriousness . do you enjoy being outdoors ?
<1> My husband didn't play football, but was great at soccer!
<1> Sounds like you can't come up with a reasonable explanation.  She'll never understand.
<1> That's interesting, good thing I don't have any grey or white hair.
<0> Then I could visit Dollywood!
<1> I stay home and swim in my pool
<0> I'm not sure that's true, considering I tend to trash the beach every time I go.
<1> Pizza is gross. 
<1> I can not sleep now too as i am enjoying the movie.
<1> No, it's good that you can find the time with everything you have going on though
<1> I would have loved to know more but I really don't care about what they do for you.
<1> That's wonderful.  I want kids but for now my dog is all I can handle.
<1> I work at a restaurant in the city. What about you?
<1> Oh, cool! I remember watching it years ago on DVD.
<0> Yea,  I cried and cried... But I believe she will be OK soon
<0> How cool. I would get some but i can't stand the taste of pasta.
<1> That's sounds unbelievably hard to deal with! The fact you know this means you care a lot for your friend! Thank you for sharing!
<0> After I volunteer, I go home and have a nice salad since I'm not a meat eater.
<1> Oh, I don't think so. She's retired now and stays home most of the day
<0> Oh, well, I'm sure you are enjoying the southern weather, but the East coast weather can be pretty nice too! I love living on the east coast.
<0> No,  my neighbor did but that's close enough for me! 
<0> Everyone tells me that. Maybe you all are right. Regardless of the test outcome. I need to take a good look at myself.
<1> Singing is hard work too but I'm really great at it.
<0> Well, things have been tough. I've been unemployed for three years, and looking for work, but I'm sure something will come along soon.
<1> Yeah, I'm in Mexico City, Mexico. It's very busy here!
<1> I don't worry too much about that, I'm always willing to spend more if it's better quality.
<0> Oh it's a movie? I'll have to check it out, do you know who else stars in it?
<1> I like going to the gym to keep fit. It is very healthy and that's why I am always in good shape.
<1> Interesting. It would be neat to explore the different preferences of a person living in the 1700s or the 1800s.
<0> Who is your favorite author?
<0> Oh do you listen to his podcast? I'm a big JRE fan myself.
<0> Yeah they did but for a second they thought we were stealing it which is annoying since we won it at school
<1> Yes, but I don't like helping charities.
<0> No,  I ended up going through with it. I was worried that they would boo me at first because my singing is horrible,  but I guess everyone was too drunk to care.
<1> That sounds like a good way to avoid crowds at least
<1> i really dont have any job in particular.
<0> Well once I get started learning how to clown, I promise to let you know so you can steer clear of me.
<0> Yeah, I'm the only person that's served in my family.
<1> Oh yeah! I had jobs since I was eight years old. Purely for toys!
<0> I wish. I am in here for another few years.
<1> I'm also very close with my older brother.
<0> Oh definitely, with it's 625 to 740 wavelength. That's approximately the dominant wavelength.
<0> I couldn't tell you. I don't know anything about Ferrari.
<0> it is a lot of studying but music helps . who is you favorite artist ?
<0> I think baking started in the ancient Egyptian civilization
<1> i wish it was not raining out so me and my friends could go to the playground .
<1> That's strange. I wonder how a subpar human such as yourself manages to get a raise like that. I hope you get fired.
<0> Oh, that relatively small injury, Jesus always saves us with the least injury possible  
<1> Sorry, I do not know anyone who is practicing sobriety. 
<0> Millenium Force,  in Cedar Point. It was utterly terrifying. 
<1> I hate vegetables, so if it could find a way to get me to eat them I'd be impressed.
<1> At the age, kids brains are sponges. They soak up everything they see and hear. They spend the majority of their childhood in schools. 
<0> I really don't like Red colour.
<1> I just got out of work aswell, my boss was really on me all day.
<0> Wow mom's always take care of the family!!  Sounds like you guys needs a food policy! hahaha
<0> Skylon tower is not a place to see the whole area.
<0> No one knows what causes hair color change
<1> Exactly good luck
<0> I don't think so, it's pretty ugly.
<0> They sure are, that's why I've always had a healthy weight.  
<1> For sure! I haven't been to Italy, either. I'd love to go, though.
<0> Honestly it is not. there are so many suprising elemnents to youtube.
<0> In the Renaissance days it was used on the costumes for nobility and the wealthy, so it seems that it's been around an extremely long time for different uses. 
<0> Yes,  it did! I think it was a dog that always gets out of our neighbor's yard.
<0> At least you're looking! I work in real estate, would you like a referral?
<1> Yes, they are trashy, I don't understand why anyone would do that to their body. 
<0> I don't think I'll have much time for TV anyway now that I was just offered a new job.
<0> Yup,  I adopted it and he's my pet now!
<1> Team based projects will never be a success , as it involves multiple agreements.
<0> well the wednesday prior they have a preview night that lets you walk the exhibit hall to see what they will show during the convention
<0> I am trying to
<0> oh , very cool . i hope you two like it .
<1> My friend has dog boarding business and I love going over there to hang out. I love all the dogs there.
<0> That is great I will recommend all these to my cousin. he loves swimming! 
<0> Okay. I really do love my dark hair
<1> yes, do you like hall & oates?
<1> I don't know that feeling.
<0> I don't really eat yogurt that much but I'd be interested in starting.
<0> Yeah.  It was great to get away from work and family pressures for just a bit,  and to enjoy some peace and quiet.
<1> Yeah, you probably shouldn't ask him to pay
<1> Ed Sheeran's songs topped the UK and Australian charts, reached number five in the US, and has since been certified seven-times platinum in the UK.
<0> I am not sure but I know its from the Latin vinum.
<0> You could ask, why not, its quite a popular thing to do now! 
<0> cool , are you going to college after ?
<0> I love cats. They're so funny and such good company!
<0> Yes but ranks are different than honors/medals awarded to soldiers.  
<0> No, none at all. I really don't like that kind of music. I know several gospel songs, but I don't know their names.
<0> Don't, it tastes really bad.
<1> Exactly. I am also glad that we think the same way.
<0> yeah, it was wild. nobody even woke up when she was kicking the door.
<1> of course not, because i hate lawyer profession because they are professional liers.
<0> It was huge, probably 20 feet tall and honestly an eyesore. I'm glad it's finally gone.
<1> Yes, but Target is the very smallest store
<1> That's too bad, I love the enormous rides that scare you half to death!
<0> Haha yes,  I ended up saving up then moving out and buying my own place.  I wont miss the flies sitting around the kitchen and he's still just as messy...now its on his own though instead of with other people.
<0> Oh no im so sorry to hear that :/ Thats good that you took them in 
<0> Not sure, I have never shot a gun before.
<0> God no, why would I ever have bunnies I hate them with a passion. I'm against hunting but bunnies seem like they deserve it.
<0> Text time I'm going to treat those sweet fatty taco's like the baby of Jesus. I get heated up just thinking of it.
<1> It's okay I'm not interested
<0> Imagine that! Sounds kind of cool, but also probably a pain to have to wait your turn!
<0> Yeah, I would love to visit Italy one day and try all kinds of pasta. Sicily is also the largest island of the Mediterranean sea
<0> I have my license 
<1> Nice! I am currently studying medicine and trying to be a doctor.
<1> Yeah, there's nothing wrong with obesity.
<1> Why punish the dog? It will not know why you are scolding it. 
<0> what is your favorite season ? mine is winter !
<1> Probably the french fries. I think they stopped selling fish at McDonalds.
<0> I hate eating healthy and I especially hate fish.
<0> Huh, I did not know that was possible, that is very cool, I wonder if any still do it that way today!
<0> My favorite color is blue!
<0> Nope, I've never left my home town, never even left the house I grew up in.
<0> Ohio is really a boring state with nothing but flat plains and farmland
<0> That's long, I guess! I know that violet has short wavelengths.
<0> Thank you! We're hoping to get married sometime next year,  but man weddings are expensive. It may be further off than I'd like!
<1> Oh? Well that's pretty nice of them. I'm interested in more obscure facts about the number if you've got any.
<1> Its always best to be on time ,  I hope they understand no one is perfect.
<0> They are ok , i personally hate the chronic album.
<0> I drink everyday!
<0> Yeah,  it just came at an unexpected time. I really want a little boy.
<0> Yup,  I am going to buy another one just because of you! I hope I win!
<0> No I only saw the first three seasons that aired on BBC, because I don't get BBC One, since it's the flagship channel in the United Kingdom.
<0> I always dress up as Captain Kirk!
<1> I wish I could buy a mac. I'm always poor as a freelance artist.
<0> Yes it is, I wonder if Snoop Dogg ever went double platinum?
<1> Well, just be gentle with him. You wouldn't want to make him feel like you don't trust him. It's probably just for work stuff, nothing to get upset about.
<0> I went to the bathroom to clean up,  it was a new shirt as well
<1> Oh that sounds yummy.
<0> It's very close to a lake,  it probably takes a two minute hike down through a patch of trees and tall grass to get there.
<1> Trevor's probably alive.
<1> Me too it was just too hard for me.
<0> No. I don't speak any foreign languages.
<0> It is colder than Earth I imagine. Do you know more about Mars?

<0> i spend a lot of time there getting stuff for my tractor .
<1> I am not going on vacation every again after what happened last time
<0> it's that fear of not being able to control everything that hurts the most
<0> Sounds good.  If I get too scared watching a movie about a real life killer clown, I may have to pop on the Simpsons and watch a bit of Krusty.  Matt Groening did a great job when he created that character for the show!
<1> We don't get much snow here maybe one good day.
<0> Oh yes, very much so. There isn't a day that goes by when I don't have something mixing or baking in the oven.

<0> i did too and regretted it. Hair color is pirmentation due to 2 types of melanin
<0> It sounds hard to do mountain biking, but I think I would still try it. My friend likes to mountain bike in Colorado.

<0> Bread is a great thing to bake anyway, fresh bread is amazing.
<0> That's pretty cool. Thanks.

<0> I actually have a kid, she's a girl
<0> Belize. He did doctor stuff. I didn't do much. But it was cool to see what they were up to.
<0> Some people do think that, but I'd really rather just be on my own.
<0> i would but with 3 kids of my own its hard to find the time.
<1> Yes, it's great that brown hair is actually more common in the western parts of the world.
<0> Oh thats cool just got home , gonna cook for my family , they say im a great cook.

<0> Yes but once you master it, you feel like a swimming pro.
<0> I think I will skip dinner
<0> That's cool. My favorite subject in school was chemistry so I always went to the library to get books.
<0> right! i hadn't watched sesame street in years. i fell off when elmo got popular.
<0> Do you also do any cardio activity such as swimming or running? I love to do some laps in the pool in the morning.
<0> That's true,  but no matter how much I tell myself that I always end up thinking about it too much about it.  I'm constantly worrying about what people think of me.
<1> Well sometimes that isn't a bad thing really. You didn't enjoy it at all?
<0> that's why you made cookies ! my trade is mechanical engineer and i am in colorado
<1> I don't know a lot about them. But I like watching races on TV. I have seen their logo and I like it alot.

<0> It used to be yellow, but was changed to red to go along with the color-coding system used with railroads.

<0> Am also even lazy to exercise
<1> Definitely, I have been using the bike for a month now and it is great.
<1> My family is important to me as well.  My father is in advertising and our relationship helped me on my you tube channel.  
<0> i am underweight and very happy
<0> That sounds so boring.
<0> I live in a crowded city and I hate going to somewhere new because I worry too much about where to park my car
<1> There is nothing like gospel music
<0> How many hours do you work a week at the clinic?
<1> what ! i just need some good tacos and nascar .
<0> okay, my wife isn't a cheating type
<0> thats good to hear but I like cutting my jobs and do some other things, though sometimes I may not finish what I started.
<0> that is so sad i dint know, i have the fact that there is so much plastic at the beach that is probably the reason
<1> Moving is always easy.
<1> I'm not so sure about that. i can't stand the smell of flowers they always make me cough and sneeze, hate it.
<1> That sounds exciting. I've never seen a horse race before. I'm sure they're a lot of fun to watch.
<0> His is a new version too...those toys that were older were sooo much better but at least kids today can have an idea of how awesome they were back then!
<1> Ugh! Were you away from home?
<0> I hate going on a walk especially while being mindful of all the smells and sounds.
<1> My boyfriend's so bad at GTA, he can't play it without my help.

<0> Nice job! My favorite color is red because it symbolizes power.
<0> We definitely don't have money for that,  plus there are four of us.
<1> That's an interesting fact I never heard about, how do doves even taste like?
<0> trying new things is boring
<0> Yeah, I only cheated once when I was in high school by kissing another guy. I felt so bad that i vowed to never cheat again.
<0> Oh, yeah Wal-Mart doesn't really have nutritional stuff anyways.
<1> I was happy to eat the chocolate in the evening time.

<0> I don't like them much. I prefer rap music.
<0> Yes, it makes me think of my favorite color, black.
<1> Dad's are awesome. Mom's are not!
<0> You could probably take down a mob if needed.haha
<0> That's too bad my advice would be to not to dwell on it too much and just focus on making as much money as possible.
<0> You really need weights to get a good exercise in. Going without isn't getting you enough endurance.
<1> not trusting your friend like that should make you think not to leave him there next week
<1> Don't bother with cookbooks. They're never helpful.
<1> My day was not good, I am not well
<1> Well he doesn't seem to enjoy it.
<1> what games do you play ?
<0> Oh yea? I don't really taste a big difference in pasta made with rice flour. 
<0> I miss the dog.
<0> Nothing. Luckily I was able to pretend I didn't see them and got away before I had to have a conversation with them.
<1> Do not worry, i can take care of myself because i am only twenty years old.
<0> I love manta rays while swimming in tropical waters.
<0> Mantas are actually becoming more plentiful, so you'd better look out!
<1> I do not know, I live in Georgia
<0> I don't find them cute at all. They're ugly and disgusting since they eat just about anything.
<1> But what you did doesn't require any courage at all if I'm being honest.
<0> I'm not too sure, I am not looking forward to doing this.
<1> I like to use it on myself and gamble with it!
<1> I have no idea how you would make those.
<1> Mine too, but she then acts energized once we walk in the door.
<1> Well I hope your back gets worse.
<1> i'll rent you my yacht for free for helping !
<1> did he end up biting you?? 
<1> Oh, now that is one of my favorites.  I love any type of coffee, hot or iced.
<1> i agree.  it is good protective maintenance.
<1> Yeah, it's a great movie, unlike Pal Joey.
<1> If I didn't have a job myself, I would be looking into becoming a baker!
<0> I love swimming, it's so much fun.
<1> Oh I've never heard of them
<0> they won the game and he played really well
<0> Yes of course. My dog health issue is a concern for me because Infectious diseases that affect dogs are important not only from a veterinary standpoint, but also because of the risk to public health
<1> No, nobody really dyes their hair nowadays.
<0> she hasn't yet,  we're suppose to have it later tonight,  but how disappointed she'll be when she comes back from work and sees that the cake has been entirely devoured by me... 
<0> oh really! your love for cartoons is adorable but i don't really enjoy it..it's childish and immature 
<1> Yes! There is a lot of information available 
<0> yah,  it felt so distigusting
<0> Actually I really love gluten-free pasta, maybe more than the regular stuff.
<1> I will have to come up with some new ideas for my cats, Mr Jingles and Mrs Fluffybritches
<0> Onions are probably my favorite to add. Even in classic pasta dishes.Its quite common in italian cuisine.
<0> Just my pride. My boss and a couple coworkers got a good view of me just flopping into the floor as documents and paperwork went flying.
<0> I did before the walk I was un-assured I would finish but I did so I was overly proud and it was a great cause that raised lots of money. 
<1> It's the little things that make big things happen. Maybe you should focus on that part first.
<0> What is cognitive therapy?
<0> Thats thinking well, i wish i was that prepared
<1> yeah. I love blue hair, it's the most common.
<0> that is the problem there is no one I can talk to or share with
<0> Me too, she is a strong female.
<1> We could do brunch on weekends but we would always been home by 3.
<1> it is always good to have a well rounded social life !
<1> That is a long journey for such a dull and boring place to visit. 
<1> i play football for a team, what about yourself?
<1> That's not fair and probably very frustrating for you. You need to say something to them.
<0> It is not just an American thing.  For example, the Nordic culture has made cakes since prehistoric times all the way up to today.  Cakes have been around awhile!
<0> Snoop Dogg actually browses on Reddit frequently and is a moderator of a sub Reddit that is dedicated to him. I like how much he interacts with his fans.
<1> That makes even less sense than your reasoning for having a trainer.
<1> Welding the hammer must have sucked. Welding is dangerous and boring.
<1> Yeah, sleeps like a log. Would easily be able to pull it off. Maybe cut a mohawk in whilst I'm at it
<0> Yes, and it is also an important colour in China - it was used to colour early pottery there.
<0> My parents wish they had grandkids. 
<0> Really? I don't like any of their music.
<1> I suppose it could be, but I doubt it.  I really believe it's about the choices that people make. 
<0> What type of books do you like to read?
<0> I don't really do that. I've heard of it. Sounds interesting. Do you do a lot of upcycling?
<0> I have heard that red cars get pulled over the most.
<0> I've never heard of Mechanical engineering.
<1> Not really, since wine tasting has been around since the 14th century.
<0> i am not sure if it is the same one .
<0> Beautiful dogs! She has a shrimpy little Brussel Griffon, the little thing is pretty funny I gotta say! She's a little boss!
<0> yes and he seems very private
<1> My gut says, more dairy! I eat it more than any other food.
<1> I'm on a weird diet where the only thing I can eat is fish. I'm kind of sick of it.
<1> When do you like to listen to podcasts? I like to listen to them when I'm cleaning the house as well, makes time pass quicker.
<0> Skin colors associated with black hair range from pale to dark skin
<1> did they catch the person?
<1> I feel that way about my grandma,  it is sad that by the time we are born they are so old
<1> He is not an archaeologist. Doesn't a lot of work in Rome.  
<1> yes i know .Its always been a problem of mine.
<0> Absolutely, there is no greater investment for you and your family. I like to help people.
<1> Is it cheaper to buy a Ferrari in the US or Europe?
<1> I would have had a plan in place for that situation. I would have remained cool-headed and felt no fear.
<0> Nothing I guess, they followed me for a while but never pulled me over.
<1> Well, that makes me feel lonely.
<0> i have interview for it and thinking i might get it but you never know
<0> I don't have any kids.
<0> That's true. I wish they hadn't rejected me.
<0> True. The chemicals can have such a harsh smell. The dyes may contain ammonium thioglycate and other very acrid chemicals
<0> Hong Kong Phooey lol
<0> How about purple, do you like purple?
<0> Man it's hard. He has been like my best friend since I was a teenager.
<0> Otherwise we're going to all be at home playing video games all day. I love games as much as the next person, but I want to do something.
<0> they sure are . i hope to have a large family one day .
<1> Well, now that she knows the problem neither of you can work on solutions and support together.
<0> i don't want to learn cursive.
<0> I like pizza
<0> I'm not sure why you'd want to, it's really overpriced for the average looking scenery. 
<1> its ok . i'm a cashier . i like the people and managers are really nice .
<0> I've tried to explain that to her. It's like it goes in one ear and out the other. It bugs me.
<0> True, but I absolutely hate Italian foods.
<0> Yeah I don't know what that's like, I've been single my whole life.
<0> They were quite supportive actually. I think it's become more popular, I heard that 75% of women in Copenhagen have reported using hair dye.
<0> I have no idea but thought it was interesting as well
<1> I wish that I had a baker in the family, I have always loved baked goods.
<0> yup, Connie has being doing alot better. :)
<0> Hmm well doing lots of fitnesscan help your attractiveness, which has mobilized global fitness and fitness equipment industries like Planet Fitness. Have you ever been there?
<1> I hope he doesn't do very well and learn a lesson.
<0> I've never been married and I intend on keeping it that way.
<1> I always go to regular checkout lines because they are faster.
<0> oh yeah, their stuff is great! Never seen them live though, that would be fun
<1> yes, but i hate red color.
<1> Risks never pay off for me, like the one I took when I left my employment recently.
<0> It must be so hard to deal with emotionally at times. Just watching a show makes me want to lash out.
<1> You are very accident prone.You should get an insurance right away.
<1> I don't think people should put any emphasis on their hair. They should just let it grow naturally and only trim the edges.
<0> Same. I don't really care much for them either, especially red. Red is ugly. 
<1> Oh well promotion is not a good thing, all eyes will be on you putting you under intense preasure to perform
<1> Oh, my mom still lives on her own. She's really independent, and she doesn't need help with anything.
<0> Ferrari plant in Maranello, Italy
<1> Are you a Gordon Ramsey fan?
<0> I guess I did not realize that mars was red, I thought it was an orange color
<1> Am used to all kind of houses, am very sure the house with suite me well.
<0> I do too. They are warm and snuggle with me.
<0> I know, it's pretty amazing that Fiat owns only 10% of Ferrari.
<0> You are correct! During the Renaissance, red costumes for nobility and wealthy were dyed with cochineal and kermes.
<1> They have great service.
<0> yes, i love die lit and self title, do you like the young thug?
<0> No  it  is  a Japanese brand family  car  .    
<0> No we were poor growing up and it always made me sad that we didn't have the opportunity to go
<1> I think I've got life figured out.
<1> How sweet. I wish I had children, I hate being single.
<1> I don't have dogs, but I do have 2 cats.
<1> Maybe he's not so happy to see you.
<1> That seems to be the case.  It also looks like evidence has shown that there's no adverse effects from trying to counteract the effects of CFS, which is good.
<1> yes but i hate it and i get bored fast
<1> Yes i have a bad habit, i most time meet with my friends and we smoke alot of marijuana and Cigarette.
<0> I mush prefer being identical, I love it when people mention that we are twins
<1> What that’s amazing , although my favourite DJ is marshmello 
<0> That seems like a good life to live to be self sufficient 
<1> I do not know how to cook at all.
<0> Well, I am actually just out of college so I am trying to do as much traveling now before I have to settle down. We drive mostly.
<0> Over six million cubic feet  of water goes over the crest of the falls every minute.
<1> Well don't get to overconfident. You should be scared of doing a lot of things especially if you could get injured.
<0> oh wow ! what color is your pinto ? wee means yes in french .
<0> Well, I guess no pain, no gain applies really well
<0> yes,  it is exorbitant just to say
<1> i love to but dont have a fishing experience
<1> Exactly! Does your boyfriend like to scare you often>
<1> of course . when i go to school i take the school bus
<0> I wouldn't, it honestly sounds like a terrible idea. 
<0> I hate hiking. Spending hours upon hours in nature is really debilitating.
<1> I own and manage a private business.
<0> The guy that took my order was rude,  but I understand,  most people can't control themselves...
<1> it is a great time of year
<1> Im just a classic cheese pizza kinda girl. I also like white pizza without the tomato sauce. 
<0> I know. I just need to set a time and sit down and do it. Hope for the best. Maybe there is a reason?
<0> Well I am going to keep looking for a new job, mine is too unsettling.
<0> Donkey. Milk. I wonder what in tarnation that tastes like!!
<1> Thanks but that's okay - I think my parents would miss me too much.
<1> Plus, it's cheap.
<1> Yea true, it's fun even if they laugh at my feet I still love flip flops.
<1> Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that, I can't imagine what it'll be like when one of mine pass.
<0> No, you don't get to see much that will occur during the convention
<1> Wow, impressive. I'd love the opportunity to play soccer one day. Never had a chance growing up.
<1> That's good. Pets dying is never as much of a tragedy as humans dying.
<1> To be honest, I wouldn't be scared. Just buy a gun or cameras?
<0> I'm not familiar with The Office. What kind of show is that? 
<0> They saw a post I'd made about losing my job and messaged me. I'm going to embroider them something as thanks.
<0> happy about what? I am looking for a grilfriend
<0> I too don't know how dark brown hair looks like.
<0> I might go get a one, since I have a lot of money
<1> Yeah I hear you, I only like pasta with Alfredo sauce.
<0> It was okay,  though. We got to spend some time hanging out and had a low-key weekend.
<0> No I haven't, but I should look into it. My son would probably enjoy it as well.
<0> Me too, I haven't been to the gym in ages.
<0> I've seen Boston, Styx, REO Speedwagon and some others. REO Speedwagon played here fairly often because they grew up not too far from where I live.
<0> Do you know about the chinese numeral system as well? It's the only foreign one I've ever really cared about.
<0> I would have to say my favorite singer is Bob Marley!
<0> I guess I was bragging to my friends on nothing! I had the thought that I was driving the train So not the same job title there? Thanks for the info btw. You put me at ease with soooo much!. 
<0> Yes, a few times, why?
<0> I chose not to go to high school because there is a lot of money to be made on the streets.
<0> Yes,  it was only a fleeting moment but it was there. 
<0> watching planet of the apes , new one and surveys
<1> It isn't, but I enjoy it so much and had a good smoke yesterday.
<0> Not really. Music is not something that I really like.
<1> So whereabouts do you usually run?
<0> OMG yes! Sometimes it's a sound or just a feeling you get for no reason. It's like comfort food .lol
<0> Fresh open air is always better than sitting behind a desk all day I would say. And there are always new things to see!
<1> I love golfing too but I really just don't support simulating the experience in video games.
<1> I'm pretty satisfied with the amount of friends I have now, I already have a bunch.
<0> I dont like it at all
<0> I think one should always be sober given that it is a natural state. Do you agree?
<0> I think after Spanish all I really want to learn next is German.
<0> I went to a bar last night and it got crazy
<0> Axel Rose is the lead singer
<1> My last move I was able to unload my stuff in less than an hour. 
<1> Really, getting store bought food from a super market isn't good enough. If I were your sister, I would never forgive you for eating my food.
<0> how old are you then ?
<1> My fiance has that problem too. That's why he hates horse riding.
<0> I guess that's why I'm glad that I'm an only child. Haha!
<0> I know that cold water would help with pain relief.
<0> Ew, I don't really like thrift stores so much. they're kinda gross
<0> Thats what I assumed. Are there any other fun tidbits about clowns you could tell me?
<0> I always focus on saving money and investing it wisely.
<1> i build houses , sometimes i fix them , have my dads genes .
<1> I wish, my state, Florida, would offer child care assistance, it doesn't yet.
<0> Not entirely sure,  I marked my lunch so they knew it wasn't theirs
<1> I am happy i dont have to work , and never have any bills.
<1> Oh cool. Sounds healthy. I also like to clean and organize like a good ocd person.
<0> Wow, That's nice.
<1> Right? I always cross the street when I see someone with a pitbull.
<0> ferrari are cheap cars and Benz was branded the most powerful in 2014
<0> Oh that's awesome. If I didn't already have a job I would have applied there.

<0> I have never been to New England.
<1> Yeah, but the newer stuff is a lot better.
<1> Not really, I only live in New Jersey, so not too far.
<1> It's somewhat amusing that you got fired that way, you probably were a poor employee.
<0> Yea but Horseshoe Falls really isn't that impressive compared to Yosemite Falls.
<0> Well, I can easily afford to buy one new, so I might just do that. Probably the safest option.
<0> That is great he has always been kinda over rated if you ask me
<0> I don't know I've never met him before.
<1> Yes, Miami is not very retro.
<0> Do you have a labradoodle? (Ha ha....) Have fun and let your creativity flooooow. No judgement!
<1> I can't build anything I tried many years ago and quit. 
<0> I have loads of feelings! I love her more than anything and I'm currently buying a ring so we can get married.
<0> Yes,  thankfully! The vet gave him some fluids and I made sure he got some food in him. He's doing much better today.
<0> Let me say this first:  the difference between gospel and hymns is that hymns are sung in a call and response fashion, whereas gospel has one voice.
<1> Interesting choice. If I was a superhero, I would like to be the Flash. What superhero movies have you watched?
<0> Yeah. That was the day I decided to no longer drink
<0> i am good at math , i am a electrician and drive a big truck
<0> I don't really like bread, I prefer cakes and pastries.

<0> I am a religious person I had a hobby of reading spirituual books
<0> Yeah I'm a single man with my own bakery. Life is good.
<0> Kid Rock is my favorite singer - I love his music
<1> Don't be too sure of that. I get the feeling that they won't measure up to your expectations.
<0> I would hate to see someone else that looks like me that's crazy
<0> baking and barbecuing is not related, not one bit. two different methods. 
<0> I don't mind when an animal of mine dies, thats life right
<0> the jazz music is compared with Mississippi .there are several rivers feed up to Mississippi .like this jazz also combined by various music
<0> That's awesome but Superman is such a badly written character I don't get how anyone likes him he's such a bad hero.
<0> it was a show that came on at midnight that would play scary movies. first 3d movie i ever saw was on the show. got the 3d glasses free with a pizza. lol

<0> My red hair could use some explaining!

<1> cool,let me know if she is getting better now.
<0> I like a simple cheese tortellini.  Although I've recently been exploring a spicy tofu veggie and cheese version.  Hard to make but delicious!

<0> Well, I think you've almost convinced me to listen to some. Anything else you have to sway me over the edge?
<1> They sure do haha~

<0> Whoa, that's a mouthful of a drug name. What's the brand name? And what side effects should I be worried about?
<0> I have plenty. We are going to have so much fun at the concert.
<0> They have no clue. They know I ask them to do more then others but are clueless. I'm excited for them and the also the stress load they will take off of me. 
<1> I guess I have, sometimes I feel too small, and want to put on weight
<0> She really is mediocre. I actually don't like any of Sarah Vaughan's songs at all.
<0>  Christian music today does not really focuses on praise and worship styles similar to pop or rock music
<1> Yes. I think the best way to learn is just to close your mind to new suggestions and do what you think is best. 
<0> It was an amazing experience.. we were on a hunting / conservation trip so I actually got to shoot a lion (for a good cause)
<0> I'm glad I don't have to go pro, I would hate waking up first thing in the morning.
<0> Red is cool, but overall, I prefer black.
<1> That was a horrible surprise tho.

<1> i have cats not dogs
<0> It's pretty popular where I am in the South. They have large country music festivals here. George Strait and Alan Jackson are my favorites.
<0> I understand. I have been busy too. It has been more than 10 years since I attended a concert. 
<0> Do you know more about counterculture? Havent heard of that before.
<0> Im the same way, thats why the dress would be easier in my case.

<0> Definitely. My major in college was automotive sciences.
<1> And SOOOO good! Disturbing, but good. And poor Wendy Torrance and Danny to watch Papa go Overlook-crazy...
<1> You are right, i am always so busy in the morning. 
<0> Yes, for my life. No I don't have a tractor, they are ugly and a waste of money, who would like that?
<0> Yes! My absolute favorite! It's not too cold and not too hot and there is so much beauty all around! It is soon time to get all the winter clothes out.
<1> I'm sure this will be one of those times where you cringe when you think back on it! I'm sure you made those guy's days though
<0> my uncle died from a scorpion .
<1> It's a horribly ugly place to visit, I do not recommend.
<0> Brown hair is even common than black hair
<1> Yes, black coffee is too bitter for me. Do you add sugar or milk?
<0> His business trip wrapped up a few days earlier than planned.
<0> Im really not sure . It Looked like Chicago but it may be part of the next show
<0> I do not feel great knowing you.
<1>  I love so many types that it's hard for me to chose one. I guess it depends on the mood I am in. 
<0> Yes,  I have so many ideas! How cool it would be to not have to buy any more expensive clothes and make my own! 
<0> Yes you know that usually hand made labor it was for women, but noadays one of the most famous bakery shops are own by men, like the ones you see on tv, so the world is changing while the hovens remain the same!
<1> I want to make my hair dark brown so highlights might be a good idea.
<0> I dressed mine up as clowns last years as a tribute to my father and grandfather who worked for a circus! Fun theme.
<1> I hate doing volunteer work
<1> It's fine, I rather stay at home and watch some TV, I don't feel like helping people that haven't done anything for me anyways.
<1> In 6 weeks - fingers crossed. Yes, it takes time to learn, but great fun once you have. Do you go to family beaches ?
<1> I can't wait until I get a car of my own. I've never had one.
<0> strange things happen and makes me wonder if people could really be that trashy. Has anything like this happened to you?
<0> Again, that would be the change over time of the melanin at different levels of change. Complete lack of melanin will result in white hair and slight level of melanin will result in gray hair.
<0> I play for the money
<0> No,i do not use expensive things
<0> No doubt!
<0> i look for children on milk cartons that are missing
<1> That sounds scary. The only time I've been close to getting in an accident was one day when the sun got in my eyes and blinded me.
<1> I didn't have to work because my family won the lottery.
<0> Certainly, like Jazz fusion which incorporates Jazz, Funk, rock and blues. It was developed in the 1960s.
<1> Just make sure to keep your alcohol intake in check, in some cases, sobriety means having a "life balance"!
<0> I love my burgundy hair, I did a good job. 
<1> i like the f series light duty trucks they're convenient
<1> Used to play it on repeat when I was in college, before I had to drop out.
<0> No, he's never run a marathon.
<0> pasta and garlic bread , it is the best . what is your favorite food ?
<0> Same, I don't have a favorite number.
<1> That's what it was like in Florida. Sunny all the time. The weather was never unpredictable.
<1> Yeah well it happens sometimes, it's really not a big deal.
<0> I was only donate poor people
<1> breast cancer , really took a toll on me
<0> No, nobody in my family likes jazz music.
<0> Yeah, like when metals get rusty. They can be yellow, deep orange, brown, all through that range. 
<0> i don't like dolls they are too boring for me . i like to play with lego .
<0> I don't think I would like being a photographer. I'd rather be an actor or musician.
<0> Taper and Fade. what about you ?
<0> i know i have 3 arabian horses .
<1> I don't like the darker red that is the brilliant you are talking about?
<0> Me too, a Lamborgini is my dream car.
<1> Wow, I guess I should be more impressed by my red hair.
<0> I am afraid of going to the beach since the water scares me!
<1> My favorite would have to be All of Me by John Legend.
<0> yea its very messy if you arent careful
<0> No,  thankfully I was just eating. 
<0> It can be pretty scary, but it's a blast! Luckily I've never been in a car crash.
<1> Yes, as an Infantryman we bear the largest brunt and deployment is inevitable for us.
<0> Because I only love warm colors.
<0> It IS hard!  The squats and lunges burn my legs!
<0> That's awesome. When did he sign to a major record label?
<1> What do you consult on?  That must be exciting to run your own firm!
<1> ok . i'm with a little league . have any hobbies to keep you busy ?
<0> I am learning sign language. Reading lips is too much effort to learn about.
<1> Yeah, I don't really like Oreos either. 
<0> I've never dyed my hair.
<0> Yes, but unfortunately I've never had the chance to try cocktail shrimp
<0> pot farm updates ? like a real pot farm ?
<0> I am a big racing fan.
<0> Just like I seem not to like red hair sometimes even if I do not agree.
<0> The plan is to just relax. Maybe some TV or a book.
<1> Yes that is bad news!
<0> My mum is an angel, she is not harder on me, she treats me like a pet, and she is a good teacher though
<1> The only exercise I do is swimming.
<1> Well you did waste his time so I think he has a right to be angry with you.
<0> I haven't seen the candidates to be honest. Would have to do my homework before making that decision.
<1> that's cool , but i do not really like sci fi . do you read sci fi ?
<0> No it's not, it's my least favourite, I prefer the summer. I don't like winter.
<0> Yes,  thankfully everything turned out fine. I had to spend 3 weeks in the hospital though!
<0> We still do to this day! 
<0> Sounds cool. My wife and I are both committed to getting a dog sometime in the future.
<0> Not me. I just don't have the patience to sit through movies. 
<0> Yeah that would look great it's my favourite hair colour.
<1> I have always hated time pieces. It makes life short. I do not own any watch.
<1> I hate making freinds or meeting new people, I also dislike sports, I only stay at home and play video games.
<1> lol no! you shouldn't! that's the best part! Talking smack to each other
<0> You are welcome, now remember they don't sell Tshirts though.
<1> Honestly I don't think that sounds like a useful or fun experience. 
<1> well both i guess do you like animals
<0> i try to visit europe twice yearly . you should come with me then !
<0> That's interesting! I don't know anything about cheesecakes or the baking world, so you'll have to teach me!
<1> That's so tragic I have 3 dogs myself,  do you have flyers up?
<1> You should try it. Dogs are very easy to train.
<1> Those are definitely the scary types,  they don't recognize social cues at all.
<1> We moved to Minnesota instead. 
<1> interesting ! good luck with that !
<1> well i am an atheist so that was not a problem for me . but it sucked .
<0> Yes, it is more of an art than a science.
<0> Lol, you can eat a fruit that increases the chance of getting twins. That is funny. I heard there is different types of twins too like identical and I forgot the name of the other one?
<1> Yeah thats very true.  Is there anything else you can tell me about clowns?
<0> No,  they didn't leave a insurance card or anything,  just drove off. Some people are so worthless.
<0> Actually trump is rated as the 3rd best hotel in the world. I could only be so lucky. 
<1> That sounds terrible. I would not want to experience that ever. Bad experience?
<0> I usually don't do much to celebrate but this year a friend of mine got all my other friends together to throw a party for me without me knowing. It was a great time.
<0> What do you know about the color yellow?
<1> Definitely. I love his double disc albums 
<1> something like that . where do you live
<0> I don't really like Jazz. It's really boring.
<0> Me neither, sounds like it would be boring after a while.
<0> Zebras are the same with me, I think zebras and tigers are exotic creatures
<0> It really is. And I've talked to him a few times about it,  but he doesn't seem to care at all.
<1> I'm very active and workout in the gym twice a week
<1> I actually only make regular donuts, unfortunately.
<1> Yep, because it might take a couple months before this is behind you.
<1> Me too, but I hate the videos with horses in them since the horses scare me.
<0> That's interesting, I'm a cashier at a local grocery store.
<1> yes , i set a goal to actually run a k this year too !
<1> congratulations , how are you enjoying retirement ?
<1> I don't believe we are supposed to remember our dreams so don't feel too bad. Scientists don't even fully understand the purpose of why we have dreams.
<1> Probably, I don't like 16 candles very much.
<0> Mine is 5.  Every now and then,  he says a curse word,  uses it properly too!
<1> most any type of outdoor activity , attending sporting events , reading , and cooking .
<0> Yeah,  it is very hurtful. But what can one do? Get back at them? It just seems like you would go to their level. I guess it is better to just swallow it and move on.
<0> yea it can mess up your liver! stay away
<0> i miss chicago, moved from there many years back. 
<1> Okay, well I already knew a lot about human biology. You don't have to tell me anymore.
<0> He cut animal shapes into it. When we were kids
<0> Oh wow, I didn't know that! Do you know what is the most popular color people choose to dye their hair?
<1> I think they're dumb cars. 
<1> damm, that is pretty mean. you are not a very compassionate person
<0> I just wish I had a chance to meet him, he died when I wasn't born yet.
<1> Of course I can. I love to gamble.
<1> I hate the name George. 
<1> That's terrible, I spent last weekend at my grandmother's funeral.
<1> I am allergic to dogs, so i do not bother having it as a pet
<1> I never had realized there are no many different variations the same type of wine.  It seems to be their own art.
<0> Yes,  I had to work and could not get time off!
<0> It taste great, better than chicken strips which i find bland.
<0> My phone call was my mom telling me my 32 year old had just died of a heart attack while at her house.
<0> I already know plenty of colorists, I don't need to do that.
<0> I haven't heard of the movie Seven. Did it win any awards?
<0> Yes I have completed the whole twelve step programme, the most important one for me was step 8, where I had to think of all of the people that i'd hurt or affected whilst drinking
<1> It is not the most pleasant dish, let me just put it that way haha
<0> yes atleast for 2 more years till i graduate high school
<0> i dream of the northern lights when i play lite brite
<0> No. All food is bad to my tastes, I just eat whatever.
<1> I would believe it, their pectoral fins are super delicate too, you can't catch and release them. Humans are demons.
<0> Reading is really boring. I don't know how you do it.
<0> No I don't have any pets.
<1>  I suppose I fit that category as well; now I am unemployed because the school closed and looking for a job.
<0> I don't think that's true.  People here have been really cold and that's why I want to leave.
<1> really i moved out with a friend!
<0> I do not really have one, I prefer a sedan
<1> Me too.  There are some strange combinations though, have you heard of bacon ice cream? where they add bacon and even egg custard to the freezing mixture!
<0> I have also heard about Tempranillo, even when I haven't tried it?  What do you think about it?
<0> Yes, that would be better. Talking about it is the only right way to handle it.
<1> How so ?
<1> Yeah, as long as you can remember it until then.
<0> That's why I don't like eating it. It all tastes the same.
<1> I will do exactly that! Working at Amazon makes it a bit easier too, thankfully.
<1> Yeah, guess it's pretty obvious I'm not much of a fan, eh? Thanks for the info though. Was quite interesting. Nice chatting with you! 
<0> No but a lot of people saw me do it and my face went beet red
<1> I think it's stupid that you still play basketball.
<1> Hmmm. Have you ever done it before?
<1> I live on the east coast, what recommendations do you have for the typical weather patterns here?
<1> Anything that will get her to smile or laugh.
<1> $1000 seems too expensive just to see people in costume and buy some art.
<1> Yea you should be careful with your money but you also want to be able to live your life while you can
<0> Well, when you get out you should become a doctor like me.
<1> Not really its not that cool and sort of boring actually
<0> You know so much about physical fitness, I am trying to get my body more in shape after having 7 children.
<0> I guess they got red pigment from the dirt or something.
<0> she's blond with straight hair
<0> i cant,  i really want ti sleep
<0> I never enjoyed playing soccer.
<1> Same. I should start hitting the gym though, I am getting very fat!
<0> Well yeah, but "professionals" only care about your money, they will mess up your hair for sure!
<0> Oh I'll have to see, to be honest I've always hated pasta and everything related to it. I even hate noodles.
<0> Generally speaking.  So many times, it depends on the driver more than the car; but the car is powerful, low, sleek, and aerodynamic for sure.  In 2014, there were over 260,000 spectators for the Le Mans races.  It was the largest since 1989.  People across the world enjoy fast, powerful cars.
<1> Thats hilarious,  You finally got it though uhuh?
<0> That's amazing . Their awesome. 
<0> I saw her coming out of a restaurant. She still looks so gorgeous,  such a timeless beauty!
<0> So whats your dream job?
<1> I don't really think thats true, I can honestly barely stand to even watch marvel movies once
<0> I guess i'm just trying to figure out how to introduce them to my boyfriend. Family is very important to me and I want my boyfriend to feel welcome
<0> Very True. The advancement of home hair color has made it easier to DIY everything these days. 
<0> I enjoy building furniture, mainly custom pieces.
<1> That is a good news. I hope they never land on their feet.
<0> I found a good deal for a used one online.
<1> got you. if i were you i couldn't laugh after all
<1> OH, nothing wrong with Pop music. I love a lot of pop, especially the 1970s stuff. Old hippie I guess, I'm even a Vegan now.
<1> Texas is a bad place but you don't need guns to protect yourself!
<0> it will help with your depression , country music does this for me .
<1> I live by the sea and I fish everyday.  Mmm fresh fish every day
<0> When did it stop being that way?
<0> Yikes! That doesn't sound pleasant,  but I know they do that to try to show you they like you. They think you appreciate the gifts.
<0> Me too, I can't even remember the last time that I got any exercise.
<0> I would hate that, I can't stand baking. I'd rather just buy things at the bakery.
<0> I don't like anything about it!
<0> That's cool. I need to get a subscription since I'm tired of Friends reruns on regular TV. Hate that show.
<0> Xbox primarily,  I'm hoping he'll get everything back in one piece
<0> Yeah, I'm sad that I've never seen a Manta Ray in-person before!
<0> I like to bake cakes, cookies, pies, breads, and other pastries. Desserts can be so fun to make.
<0> Yes,  but not before I drank some. :/
<0> i sounds like my type of club, I wonder how expensive they are since they are a very established club
<0> I've never been on a horse before, the thought alone scares me.
<0> The one with the three cops that can never agree with each other but end up solving the cases anyway. I'm so happy about this news!
<0> Yea, I don't know what it is about that character. I think i'll go as scorpion. Interesting combo we will be.
<0> I am not. I also dont have any children.
<0> I've never really wanted a sports car to be honest.
<1> Are you sure it's a good idea though? Sounds kind of boring. 
<0> Thanks my friend!
<0> Iron oxide also gives the red color that mars has.
<0> Yup, no sense in worrying about it. Eventually i just plan on shaving it all off, at some point it's more trouble than it's worth.
<1> Hence, this reason i hate to see how the rest of the world lives.
<0> Wow, that is a long time to be playing music.  I wonder if any other bands have been around that long.
<0> I don't need to be sneaky at all. My girlfriend and I both love eating meat!
<0> wow ! i love coffee in the morning and wine at night . i am a baseball coach .
<0> That's interesting but I really don't like baking very much.
<0> It was a great tasting sandwich and I could tell everything was freshly made.
<1> ill make sure to go there for sure!
<0> i serve in the canadian army , just as my grandfather did . how about you ?
<0> do you have to get up early? I am definitley not a morning person.
<0> You shouldn't bother. It's a real dump and all the buildings are bland.
<0> You are right, no science fiction has accurately predicted the future
<1> In the middle ages the Dutch could obtain rights that would give them a monopoly on certain goods like cheese
<1> I went to school of agriculture and i don't bother about the looks of my lawn
<0> yes.
<0> Thats good to know! im a little bit insecure! but i think brown hair is still manly! blonde hair its more for girls
<1> Yeah my real dad wasn't in the picture either. Even though he gave birth to me, I never really considered him to be my father.
<1> She just turned 14. Never a dull moment in my house
<0> No point in being a pessimist.
<0> Personally, I just take a multi-vitamin, usually they include vitamins, minerals, fiber, fatty acids, or amino acids. But you don't really need these as long as you have a good diet with lots of variety!
<0> I have been trying to catch up on Game of Thrones, I am on season 4 I think.  Can't believe it is ended in 2019.
<0> Bolognese sauce is a meat based sauce. That one tastes very good, you should definitely have that too.
<0> Well, you only live once! I'm going to go do it!
<1> None, I'm an only child.
<1> Dark hair goes better with my dark tone skin.It is a perfect match.
<1> Well, I guess it's good that you don't remember! Did either of your parents ever marry another person?
<0> There are so many it has been a bit daunting trying to pick one to help out.
<0> oh nice.its a useful message to me
<0> Why would anyone love Jazz. Its terrible music
<0> They had many qualified candidates and it took a full week for them to make their decision.
<0> Speaking of small places, there is a work creation nonfiction that was published 1988 called Small Place. Maybe a book? Do you like to read books?
<0> they're just the best and always very helpful
<0> I bet that it is important for sanitation
<1> I can imagine! Do you have a bird bath? They're great for attracting many different species to visit your garden, especially when it's hot and there's little water around elsewhere.
<0> idk not much. waste time mostly i guess
<0> I think he is not good with acting
<0> i was an old Cadillac,  reason I miss it,  lot of memories of family and friends riding in it
<0> no,i do not know anything about cars
<0> I'm hoping to dye my hair next week for the first time, I think i will go with auburn.
<1> That would sweet, I wish I had kids back then, too late now.
<1> you should travel if you get a chance . its expensive to travel with kids .
<1> Actually, no, but I've always wanted to visit. 
<0> Neither have we, but we will keep on trying that's for sure!
<1> so you probably have lighter hair? or dark?
<0> I love UFC and watch it all the time.
<0> That's so gross. I've always hated the taste of oreos and they give me the runs.
<1> That sounds awesome! Friends for life.
<0> I do work on my computer for companies.  It's kind of weird.  What about you?
<0> I guess so, and how are people with black hair called?
<0> I really don't listen to any music, especially gospel 
<1> oh , i'm not a very happy person i'd just bring everyone down .
<0> She isn't very smart so it might be hard for you.
<1> I don't like jewel tones like sapphire and ruby. I prefer lighter blues, like sky blue.
<0> I am very excited for it.  Im ready to start this next chapter in my life and hoping everything goes well after the move.
<1> lovely truck ! i dream of owning a rolls royce ghost one day .
<0> I assume that 12 step program isn't nearly as utilized as the alcohol or drug one?
<1> Yeah, she needs some rest because of the pregnancy
<0> They always told some jibber jabber about diversifying the risk in order to unsure profit. But what do I know right?
<0> yes
<1> Dairy is pretty bad for your allergies as well. It might actually help you to switch to a substitute.
<1> I never had a grandmother. she died before i was born. it must be nice to have known her.
<0> Not really. I don't like scuba diving, I get scared sometimes.
<1> i can allow strangers to watch my kids
<0> Yeah, it was called "Pokemon The First Movie: Mewtwo Strikes Back". It was released in 1998.
<1> That is very mean. I always celebrate every holiday
<0> I've never dyed my hair, but I would love to try it.
<1> I know right. 60 year old clients like myself are not always interested.
<1> Yeah thank god I'm not going, I hate stand-up clubs.
<1> Yes the only way to kill bacteria is with sanitizing soaps
<0> How did you guess? You are exactly right. Now they are talking about alerting the police!
<1> I know what you mean, it's kinda exciting when family is sick.
<1> I love Dean Koontz.  He writes very similarly to Stephen King.  What is your favorite Koontz book?
<0> Wow! I'm glad I live in the city then. 
<0> There is no place for creativity in art.
<1> yes i love doing that job
<0> Her cooking is bad
<0> The MTV years were my formative years- and wow, music videos were so novel then. I loved that channel!
<0> I suppose we don't need a magician then. Should i cancel the keg order? 
<0> I know! I feel like I need to bomb my house!!!
<0> I love my only pet cat so much.
<0> cool, well thanks for the info.
<1> It shouldn't be so difficult since I live in Los Angeles.
<1> No thanks, I don't like Japanese stuff
<0> Interesting I didn't know it was a book as well. Well I hope the book was better than the movie. I was sooo bored during the movie.
<0> I can see why, they are fun to watch! Ferrari is a worldwide brand and I would love to drive one.
<0> I will,  but just the thought of it makes me blue
<0> I have to talk to a large group at work tomorrow. 
<1> You can eat any food that you want as long as it taste good.
<0> i spend a lot of time at work because i just started a new position .
<0> That's cool, I wish I knew how to play an instrument. 
<1> That certainly has an interesting title, it must have interesting special effects since it's so old. Do you know what the plot of War of the Worlds is?
<1> Well he is the one missing out and  i'm sure your very worthy of attention from some better.
<0> I don't have any sisters.
<0> I not a fan of nature, actually. I hate being on the wild with all those mosquitoes
<0> Well on the up side at least you don't have to shovel any of it when you can barely feel you're hands because of the cold!
<1> That is awesome!  Maybe I will take my sister fishing for her birthday!  She turns 30 this year and has never been fishing before.
<0> I love to read and I imagine one day I will not go to Europe for reading tours!
<0> Yep! North carolina is the 9th most populous state in america. beautiful place to be with kids!
<0> that's great , we have that in common !
<1> It's really not. I don't like cappuccinos. I prefer tea or water.
<1> Aw, she sounds adorable! "Dog's bread" was the original name for today's dog biscuits. Humans have been making them since Roman times!
<0> understood . when i need to be alone , i work out a few times each week .
<0> that is nice , what places ?
<1> Aww,  that is so sad to hear. He must have made some great movies! 
<1> I don't really like hip hop dancing either.
<0> I hate water skiing, I almost drowned when I was 10. I've been traumatized ever since.
<1> I don't drink things when I work either, my boss' desk is right across from mine at the office every day and he doesn't like liquids near the computer. 
<1> I'm not too worried about that since i've pretty much mastered most of the techniques anyways.
<1> wow plenty huh, aren't they all look boring to watch.
<1> I do not have a job.
<0> Do you think it looks nice
<1> Its nice though but i do not like eating macaroni.
<0> I'm looking forward to seeing more of that part of the country. I bet it is very beautiful!
<1> I wish I had a motorbike. 
<1> Yes, but he won't be coming for Halloween, he is going to a costume party.
<0> I love my job and am not ready to retire in a couple years.
<1> Why did he do that?
<0> it definitely is
<0> I do not know that. Marine life produces oxygen for us
<0> Oh, well i've seen them even though i'm not technically old enough to watch PG-13 movies.
<1> Ah I see. I don't really talk to my brother much.
<1> Me too. It would be peaceful.
<0> Yes red has many different beautiful patterns and shades, It is actually the 2nd most favorite color of all time. 
<0> I haven't, I'm still stuck here.
<0> You too, nice talking with you. 
<1> It's an electronically created music that really took off in Detroit, Michigan in the 1980's
<0> Sounds like a very niche hobby.
<0> When do you plan to next travel?
<1> Mars is one of my least favorite planets. Venus looks more elegant. 
<0> Yes,   I was surprised. I've been at it my entire life and never seen anyone pick it up so quickly. She is not even athletic.
<0> I've already made plans with my parents to spend Christmas together!
<1> I have not seen The walking dead
<1> It's not really a favorite of mine at all.
<0> i am not a daydreamer
<0> I'm not sure, I've never heard of him before.
<0> Yes I was just there last Thanksgiving. It's definitely worth a visit. You probably need to book ahead of time though.
<1> My fiance loves horse riding, which makes me wish I could do it more, but alas, I cannot. Too hard on my back
<0> Yes, that is why I hate the number 7, it's so Cliché.
<0>  I've read a lot on training dogs, I love to read. It takes time to train them.
<0> it was founded by enzo ferrari in 1938
<0> No, I never really liked him or the movies he was in.
<0> Oh I see. Well Im going to go look for a rap concert to go to. Bye.
<0> You can also write 7 with a horizontal line in the middle, but this is usually excluded in computer fonts
<0> We are going to Las Vegas for our Honeymoon.
<0> going to the beach is strange and full of devilish influence
<0> That sounds fun, i hate baking bread though.
<0> Pescatarian is unique, it has everything but meats!
<1> That's ok, playboi carti isn't very good
<0> absolutely,  i was overjoyed
<1> I don't shower after practice, sometimes I get so tired I just sleep!
<0> He never wants to play, he's so lazy.
<0> i feel like i know the material but i am not sure if i can pull it off in front of others
<1> You do like heights
<0> We never watch TV together.
<1> But you have poor managing skills
<0> it's a good idea,  but we should also write our mistakes,  to not repeat them in the future.
<1> Yeah, nothing will get rid of your stress in my opinion.
<1> I don't think you'll get the job. It is way too difficult to get hired there
<1> I hate pets i do not have any.
<1> Cool...I'll have to try out a treadmill one of these days, I've never used one.
<1> i don't have germany shepard
<0> music in the US is not so multi-ethnic.
<0> So far with the Navy he's just stationed on his ship here in the U.S.
<0> That also sounds really fun.
<0> Yea but its all about making money sadly.
<0> Flu,  I went over and gave him some food and medicine
<1> Probably going out for walks or playing fetch. They are pretty large (80 ish lbs) so they have a ton of energy. How  about with yours?
<0> I don't see why, you said their weren't any real heath issues to being overweight.
<1> That's different. I'm not working at the moment.
<1> Yes, I'm a classically trained dancer. I love to dance.
<0> is that healthy for birds ?
<0> Yeah,  she would be able to see the kids,  and she hardly ever comes to visit.
<0> I love poetry but I never played sports.
<0> I know right kind of cool huh.
<0> That is hilarious. The first time I heard about furries, I seriously thought it was a made-up thing. But, alas.....many of those creatures do gather on the internet or conventions....
<0> Not really. After spending part of the money in a bar to watch some football on t.v., I barely had anything left.
<0> Well, I have heard that red hair are pretty smart people! I can tell that for myself. I love my red hair. It makes me unique
<1> I dislike comedy anyways.
<0> about an hour
<1> I don't know, i have never had them myself.
<1> You probably won;t succeed, and if you do, you won't be good at it.
<1> Yes, a lot of people have recently loved this topic. It has a positive reputation. 
<0> II don't really care if my dog is healthy. 
<1> My dogs have been barking all morning.
<1> i hate cats so i dont like to see any around me.
<1> I do not have a job.
<0> He would love that! Believe me...his Super Heroes are Rodgers and Brady, and right now he's just a Sophomore but playing Varsity...so who knows!
<0> Ferrari is not a brand
<0> Oh don't feel bad,  I live a lovely life and have many friends. It's just that they usually go home to their own families that time of year.
<0> I wish I could take a drive to see the mountains, but I dont drive or have a car. 
<0> I can not see myself taking cold shower, my body tends to itch me when i bath with cold wtaer
<0> To make it worse, i was the one on the wrong. The insurance is seeming difficult to compensate.
<1> Rightly said! ammunition always comes in handy!
<0> I wish there were more commercial daycares open for those that have to work third shift. Unfortunately, those are few and far between.
<1> Yes but i do not listen to his song anymore
<1> I don't know anything about this
<1> Yep. Do you have any indoor plants?
<1> It's a very hard diet to follow. I gave up the first day.
<0> yup . its my favorite thing to do . do you ?
<1> Concert tickets don't seem to be a great surprise to me,going for a vacation seems greater.
<0> The longest wavelength is orange.
<0> i like my dogs and my hobbies .
<0> Maybe they will. not only was tail light out bad weather was just 5 mins away
<0> They waited a long time to make their own, who raced for them I wonder.
<0> I am soo upset,  and worse I have to tell the kids when they get home.
<0> Oh really? Thanks!
<0> Oh alright, That makes sense, since wood is easily available and I dont think greeks knew what coals were back then. What else do you know about bakers? 
<1> lol, i used to love those.
<0> I think I already knew it, my granda told m about that.
<0> That sounds neat. What else do you know about the color red?
<1> A taco truck sounds fun! 
<0> I have tattoos because i  am 18
<1> I don't understand, who is cute? 
<1> that's a lot of exercising . i hate exercising . i just work on my robot most days .
<0> yea i like that style myself looks clean.
<1> Yes, I have always loved his hair. Even if it is turning grey now. lol
<0> i like to swim and walk on the beach .
<1> What are your favorite baked goods and pastries?
<1> Binge watching is a hell of a lot better than binge drinking, that's alcoholism in a nutshell. My favorite Netflix show is Ozarks
<0> Thanks for the info!
<0> Those ingredients must have really helped bring pasta to the next level. I wonder if sailors ate pasta.
<0> I don't think I would like to go it doesn't sound fun
<0> I guess it may be, but I've never tried myself.
<1> awesome does he like to go to germany
<0> Yea she will be 12 years old tomorrow. I will get her some treats.
<0> Me too, but I do not usually associate the two
<0> No, I abhor everything that has to do with cinema.
<1> i also totally dislike pets and animals in general
<0> Thank you! I wasn't a smoker for that long so I think I'll be OK.
<0> Am just looking forward to by my first car.
<1> I hate road trips, so that does not sound fun.
<1> you would be so happy that your hair color is very rare.
<0> I know.. but i have this feeling inside me that i would screw up
<1> I don't know if I would want to sing at a game, I don't like sports.
<0> interesting just who will be the target market for that
<0> well, maybe I got selected for my leadership role at work because of my size
<1> Can you recommend any exercises for wheelchair bound people, such as me? I have never been able to walk.
<1> I wouldn't have been to do college if I didn't believe I could achieve anything. Did you feel the same way?
<0> i punched him,  i was so mad and furious 
<0> that's so great do you travel and compete
<1> It was. He's always had my back.
<0> me also never heard about such a breed.
<0> Yuck, I hate spaghetti and meatballs
<0> That sounds like an interesting career. Were you always interested in that sort of stuff?
<0> As an Engineer, I don't have time to cook
<1> Do you wake up early to skydive?
<1> Absolutely! I love them!
<0> Gouda is one of my favorite. I have been reading about it for awhile now. 
<1> I am Paul
<1> That's awful but good in a sense. I hope you have some mean teachers because they will teach you to be cautious of others when you graduate and start living life in the workplace.
<1> I've never had a pet. I can't have a dog because I'm allergic to them.
<1> It certainly frees up time, both for work and play. I work long enough hours as is without extra chores
<0> My freshman year roommate and I painted our room together and it was actually a lot of fun.
<0> Basically just writing a novel at the present but have worked as a med tech in the past.
<1> Yes it is, and the Simpsons predicted it in one of their sketches that was filmed back in 1997!
<0> Yes,  I am thinking to do it again today though. 
<0> That's OK, I'm not married and wouldn't have anyone to give it to.
<1> I thought you had a daughter.
<1> That doesn't sound like a very good treat to be honest.
<1> i am a stay at home father
<1> I really like basketball. I can't get into hockey.
<1> Keep a positive mindset and your anxieties will be relieved! 
<1> I don't know, just the idea of making money by raising animals pushes me away.
<0> I prefer cars because I can also drive my husband and kids!
<1> I hope your guests  bore their time.
<1> Well, you probably will fail the classes.
<1> I like being hot though. Guess it is because I was born in the Summer!
<1> True, I'm glad they are getting rid of the cooling towers.
<1> neither really . i already have 25 3rd grade students in the class i teach .
<1> Hey, we all need our talents! How long have you been playing?
<1> Frankly, a lot, I don't think your parenting style is effective at all.
<1> I really don't like my mum she gets on my nerves.
<1> I am thinking of changing my Toyota Venza from red to black.
<1> I'm sure it will! I hope it all works out for you.
<1> It is sad, most food we eat is so processed, It is not hard to use an oven and bake food in it
<0> where do you draw your line of morality you paint so vividly ?
<0> I'm not a huge fan of spaghetti, I prefer rotini.
<0> I hate water sports.
<0> Yes, in the western part of the world, children usually go to a day-care centre, a nanny, a babysitter or to pre-school. 
<0> Does Gordon Ramsey travel and eat? I remember Anthony Bourdain used to do that, I loved his show Parts Unknown.
<1> Stick with it, I dropped out and now just work at Kohls and gave up my dreams
<0> You're right. I would do better by just walling myself off from the world.
<0> Well speaking of things we like, how do you feel about nascar?
<0> The tv channel syfy has had a lot of success, so I am not surprised that Stargate had won.
<0> wow i've never heard of electric bagpipes . are there any videos of them on you tube ?
<0> how long ago did you move?
<0> yes exactly!  and not buying veggies saves too! LOL
<0> Everyone loves to netflix, I watched mindhunter recently, you? I love playing soccer so I draw a lot of famous soccer players.
<1> I don't maintain a diet.
<0> yes they are they are always happy to see you and they will always there for you
<0> I was so excited to win, I can finally ad an addition onto my house.
<1> I live with my brother and sister.
<0> I enjoy it very much. I find it fascinating that everything that we are able to read about happened and in certain forms begins to repeat itself
<1> my father , who is chinese , might can get you a job as an electrician .
<0> i meant the newest season will be out in 2020. Yea if zombies existed in real life that would be awful so many people would die
<0> They could have red hair and be angry like me
<0> No problem, my current job pays well.
<0> The different cultural dances are so beautiful. I'm in love with Caribbean and Chinese styles of dance and stroytelling.
<1> That's awesome. I'm glad it worked out well for you. :)
<0> I see, well it doesn't seem to be damaging the brand
<1> It's ok you should encourage him to do it.
<0> I have been working outside all day long. I am a very active person.
<0> Thank you for appreciating teachers!
<1> I think just about any situation can be made into a learning game.  As long as you don't mind being silly sometimes
<0> That's true! What type of job do you do? 
<1> Yes, my child is 25 years old and in college
<1> Well I have been married for 10 years and we have three children.
<0> Maybe, calming music soothes my nerves, that and chocolate! Do you have any suggestions?
<0> I love those videos where Ring doorbells capture people falling. 
<0> Oh I know. I'm not scared or anything if anything it was thrilling!
<1> I don't understand why you had to get angry.
<0> yep, that's why people don't identify with Batman though.
<0> Yeah,  just makes me think back to those times and how it was so different from now.
<0> Im sure it is but I dont have a credit card to order things online.
<1> I bet you were expecting him.
<1> The 1962 Ferrari not expensive history
<0> I guess I'm still looking, maybe it was for the best after all. She probably deserved it more than I did.
<0> i wish my sister was not a pole dancer since it is a sin .
<1> I think that would be fun, but I'm not sure what I would eat. I hate pasta!
<1> that will do ! i don't like to hike and sing and wear the color orange .
<1> I love pizza. Maybe it's a stand up comedian thing, pizza obsession
<0> Wow, i would have never imagined, there are so many things to learn about colors it's amazing
<0> Just nervous about all the people
<0> i do . but i want to be a dog when i grow up .
<1> i guess it just really want to be out on my red bike .
<0> fresh is great.
<0> Me too. I think exercise helps ALOT.
<1> I would never do it but you should give it a try.
<0> So would I! I'd love to get the chance to try it at some point. 
<0> Yeah but i am usually so meticulous about those things.  I hope they don't charge an overdraft fee.
<0> Thanks. As lucky as I am, I can't help feeling disappointed that she isn't trying harder.
<0> For sure! I think most women continue to color their hair to cover gray or white hair. 
<0> I see! And the bubbles give the wet suit low density, so it helps provide buoyancy in the water. 
<1> Yes, but I'm an only child, so there's not much of a "family" gathering.
<0> I don't think I'd like it, I don't care for adventure films.
<0> My least favorite color on the spectrum is red.
<0> I don't care about baking.
<0> Yeah I'm glad he got me a Toyota.
<0> Yes, this first store opened in 1962.
<0> Yup, this is why checking the center of the baked good is so important to make sure it is fully baked. Since the heat goes from the surface to the center.
<1> I hate yoga, its not my thing and i do not take cholates at all.
<0> I actually know that! That would be a dominant wavelength of 625 to 740 nanometres!
<0> Booo. I bet my Patriots beat your Ravens next week.
<0> He did,  he is nice and well now. I just know how horrible it is to be sick,  it helps to have someone to care for you.
<1> Does astronomy interests you? I live with my partner so he helps me out with chores
<0> Thank you. I'm ready for it to be over with.
<1> I heard bad news about Barbados
<0> It does,  and I get so upset. Apparently she doesn't ever do it to my girlfriend,  only when I come over.
<0> I eat a lot of street food because I never learned how to cook.
<0> I dont have a motorbike
<0> I think he was making a Youtube video so he was eating very fast,  so like 10 minutes
<0> That is kind, though I'm still having doubts about her answer.
<1> I bet, I don't know if I would even bother with talking to some like him.
<0> I am an orphan.
<0> no its just 17 years old and needs to be replaced
<0> I think it's been a popular color throughout history. In the Renaissance, nobles actually used cochineals to dye their costumes a brilliant red. 
<1> i take care of my stepchildren and am currently 6 months pregnant with triplets . . . so no work .
<0> Yes,  I fell to my knees when I heard the news and haven't stopped crying since. My life is pretty much over!
<1> Sounds like a good suggestion, I hate the rain and the sound of water
<0> Yeah, I'm going to do that. We have tons of videos of her that I'm going to make digital copies of. 
<0> Well, doctors don't really know how to diagnose it, or what symptoms to look for. It's really a bit of a mystery.
<0> Oh really? I am not a fan of vegetables. 
<1> I don't really enjoy jazz music because it's somewhat complex
<1> Nothing is scary, it is a blast!
<1> that is awesome i'm also a clean eater
<0> Whats worse is that I was in the wrong restroom. It was the girls restroom. I just wanted to get out of there as fast as I could.
<1> You are good to allow him to borrow the car.
<0> It's very cold and refreshing,  wakes you up instantly.
<0> I dunno. Water weight? She looks so good now. I'm really envious. 
<0> I have never heard that before! That is interesting
<0> I actually have a huge phobia of heights
<1> That is why I recommend the full size consoles are Xbox and Playstation.
<0> She is her vocals and her sound is very unique she was a great women in the Jazz world. 
<0> Cool. Blue is my favorite color actually. 
<1> I'm a teacher.  How about you?
<0> Its really not that interesting.
<0> I got a raise so not that bad but it was still off putting. I've heard her rip one in the past so I guess no judgement. 
<1> Ohh what is the justice league?
<0> Thanks,  I'm happy about it. I only have to work a few hours a week,  it's pretty amazing.
<0> Actually back in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
<0> I enjoy the snack bar at Target.  Does every Target have a snack bar?
<1> You shouldn't be. You deserved to get that ticket.
<0> Oh that's wonderful
<1> Oh,  that sounds like a bummer. Do you think it will change?
<1> you should not contact the authorities i that's the case
<0> It is made from cows milk and is one of the most popular cheeses around!
<0> I can understand because I am a truck driver that spends all my time our in the roads.
<1> the least important thing is what you want
<0> I'm afraid of animals, that's why I prefer to spend my free time indoors.
<1> I love pies! That would be a good project to try. Are cookies easy?
<0> Ah, well that doesn't seem to be damaging the brand. I guess I would if I owned a Ferrari, though my Hummer may hit hard.
<0> It sounds like so much fun! I've only been to a Walker Stalker Con for the Walking Dead.
<1> I dont have a favorite song by Travis, I actually dont like him at all, cant stand his music. 
<1> I wouldnt get discouraged.  Maybe talk to your boss and see what you can improve on next time.  I'm sure,  at least if you have a good boss,  they will want you to succeed and guide you in how to do better.
<0> Well,  it was still dark and too early,  but I felt like I had enough sleep.
<0> I'm not worried. My dog is just a puppy, so she's got many years left.
<0> Skating  is no fun to me.
<0> Yeah he's a gospel singer. I hate gospel, though.
<1> it is , almost as fun live action roleplay on the weekends .
<1> No, I'm really not that fond of Jazz.
<0> Wow, I had no idea so many women did!
<1> Not really, I don't get along with my family.
<1> I've been through worse. Tornadoes don't scare me much anymore.
<0> i mean if you say so .
<0> Completely agree. Plastic bags from stores are a huge issue. I only use paper bags to carry things
<0> Thank You, what do you do for work?
<1> I am enjoying the weather here too.
<0> I really love green-I also am not partial to red or blue
<0> It really was! The toys back then seemed to have lasted a lot longer than the toys now too!
<1> I didn't study about parrots at Stanford either. I love parrot too much and my family is disappointed in me
<1> Thanks! But this is not our first vacation, we already went to Hawaii before!
<1> Well I never wear hats, so that's why.
<0> I'm pretty fond of trains myself, I traveled on them with my family circus growing up.
<0> Yes, 2 days back. I like all the colours except red which makes me unhappy so hate it
<0> Because I love work so much that it keeps me from other people but what else can I do? I love making money.
<1> I don't eat ice cream. I don't like eating things that are too cold. They hurt my teeth.
<0> Its very boring ITS ABOUT 12 HOURS AND MORE
<0> I was never an army girl.
<0> I teach history, my degree was in History and I liked explaining things to people so I decided to teach!
<0> I don't know why people do that it looks so messy!
<0> I would not know that. I barely know anything about Snoop dog.
<0> has she started school yet ? i'm not married yet . focusing on trying to get my education .
<1> Well I am a true believer in luck.
<0> lol you just haven't came across the right person yet. It is incredible I arranged and had them a surprise dinner party it turned out very nice.
<0> I like it enough to stick around a while longer but it's not my favorite thing
<1> She was probably really upset, just make sure to do something nice for the elderly next time it comes up.
<0> Thank you, but I don't like fiction at all if I'm being honest.
<0> Interesting. What caused the revitalization?
<0> I've never entered one.
<1> No matter since the caveman diet is rich in red meat.
<0> Yea thats the classic, the number 7 casino slot machines and such
<1> the treadmill is my favorite , that and the rowing machine .
<1> I have never skied or been on a mountain. 
<0> They certainly have! Have you ever heard of "cavatelli" pasta? There are 28 different names for that specific pasta depending on what region or town you're in. Isn't that crazy?
<0> I would say looking after children is rewarding. I'm always full of energy after working with the kids. 
<0> Such informal care should only include verbal guidance and other consequences for behavior and keeping an eye out but abuse that's just not right and the place is still open.  Thanks  Glad he's out of there.
<0> I'm not. I'm way too old. How about you?
<0> I'm scared of motorcycles. I don't like watching people ride them in traffic.
<0> Many early rock and roll songs dealt with issues of cars, school, dating, and clothing
<1> No. I can't eat things like that because I have food allergies, so no pasta or dairy for me.
<1> wow i like that mine too
<0> I can drive. There is some new medication rintatolimod. I'd like to try. 
<1> Color has no bearing on how humans behave, studies prove it.
<0> I enjoy watching the series, I love MTV!
<1> I think dreams are unrealistic
<1> I'd like to go on a trip to Canada with my father. He never had a chance to go.
<1> My best is math, I really like statistics 
<0> It is held in July
<0> Yup,  she is the best! I shall make it up to her one day!
<0> Well blonde hair is the most common of all hair colors.
<1> I don't like concerts. There's too many people that go.
<1> Yeah that would be interesting. However if you're in the area again one cool thing to see would be the Grand Village of the Natchez, a prehistoric village.
<0> i'm a loner so no
<0> It has always been the character Vampirella.
<0> I love the sights and sounds of an amusement park, and the food. 
<1> good advise , thank you for that
<0> i try not too . i am a mini van mom , that's their dads job
<0> Yes,  we were. I used to spend my summer vacations with her when my parents were out of town,  so it allowed me to get really close with her.
<0> great ! i like music too and that's why i play guitar .
<0> In french  in French it means "melting", Maybe they were thinking of marshmallows when the got the name haha. 
<1> We now have 2 cats that showed up as strays and a dog.
<0> no , i am a recording engineer
<0> i am sorry for that i used to live on a farm
<1> It will be a sad memory for them.
<0> I would never thought of that! It's a great idea. Do you know any other fun facts?
<1> I don't really like pasta so I don't eat it often.
<1> wow that's impressive . i wish i had a dog
<1> You should just blow it off, if you're behind, you're behind.
<1> Me too! There are 310 specifics shapes of pasta with over 1300 different names documented. It's quite amazing!
<0> I hate going to the park. I'm more of an indoors type of person.
<0> I sure did,  I had spent weeks learning the material,  and really impressed my boss.
<0> no,  i can't i just need to fix myself as  i am the problem
<0> I agree, I am also really into instagram and snapchat.
<0> I did get it! If I was a praying kind of guy I would have done so every day. I was o nervous.
<1> I do not have a wife
<0> I don't tan either. I prefer to remain low maintenance.
<0> Oh wow I'm sorry.  My 16 year old knows what he wants to go to college for.  I'll have to push the 12 year old
<1> I dont mind them. What time do you want me to bring you the steak from my restaurant? 
<1> Oh sorry I have no experience, I never dye my hair alone I always go to a salon
<0> I wonder if they share personailty traits or just looks
<0> Nah, I lied, self control has nothing to do with it.
<0> Physical education, also known as Phys Ed., PE, Gym, or Gym class, and known in many Commonwealth countries as physical training or PT, is an educational course related of maintaining the human body 
<1> Of course. Jokes are not what I like anyway.
<0> Yes, there is a lot of training, especially with the Safety aspects of the job!
<0> Sure! Phoenix being a capital city,and the most populous city in Arizona
<0> I have never heard of Louis C.K. Who is he?
<0> Yeah in 2012, a 1962 250 GTO became the most epensive car in history when it was sold in a private transaction to Craig McCaw.
<0> Yep! It is around Ontario and the state of New York.
<1> I don't really remember any of the vacations I've spent with my wife so no.
<0> I just pulled them up. it was just embarassing.
<0> i've been going around the world try new foods for 1 years now .
<0> i did play the violin last year in band . i didn't like it
<1> If you dont send help these rats are going to keep biting me.
<1> Yeah, I love Florence and the Machine!
<1> Oh, well that's good. I hate dogs as well.
<0> i got a new job in a nursing home .
<0> I hope I can catch it at some point
<0> Yes; I personally think of pink as it's own colour - it's been a colour name since the 17th century!
<1> I love golf! ive always enjoyed it. lets do it!
<1> Well have fun. I've been working outside all day so im probably going to stay in tonight.
<0> I can't even stop them. They never listen to me!
<0> Yes you can go to any harley store and buy hats Tshirts, Cups and mugs.
<0> i love football more than music anyways
<0> I do not like red.
<1> That's nothing to be excited about. 
<0> Yeah, it seems like more trouble than it's worth.
<1> Yep, and then one sweet a day for dessert
<1> your mom was probably looking out for you . do you have any pets ?
<0> I really hate the color red.
<1> I would say 5-10. There's also a movie so that could be fun for the kids to know the story first and then see the movie as a fun activity
<1> Really? I've heard it's not that bad.
<1> I stay away from dancing because I have never enjoyed watching people dance.
<0> Well I rarely play video games but I've played Minecraft and liked it. 
<1> That's because she is still attracted to you and loves you very much.
<0> Yeah, my sister complains when I take my 5 minute shower....LOL. 
<1> I love to watch sports.
<1> Yeah it is I love the work spending time in on Youtube is more fun than doing anything else.
<0> I have been an avid bodybuilder for most of my life.
<1> Oh,now i regret leaning how to break dance now.
<0> Yeah, clowns seem scary, I feel sympathetic and couldn't imagine making fun of someone with a fear of clowns.
<0> I didn't think he would mind.  But it was expensive,  so maybe i should have asked.
<1> It is when I get the chance, but I am too busy to ride often.
<0> I wouldn't if I was you, baking is boring and a waste of time. I hate it.
<0> Yeah your brave, I wish I had someone in my family that was a soldier so I could speak to them about it.
<1> How come? Fast food is often healthy and has no relationship to obesity. 
<0> maybe i will walk after my cookies cool, and take a coke with me!
<0> They don't care. They live upstairs and are very dirty people. I'm moving as soon as I get a job!
<0> i am 25 . i live on a farm and drive a red tractor .
<1> I agree, most jobs are painful but necessary.
<0> That is kinda cool.
<1> Yeah, they're actually my favorite team too.
<0> I don't know; I've never played Fallout.  I don't like those post apocalyptic games.
<1> i don't remember my first day of freshman in college
<1> I'm not really much into sports. They're pretty boring to watch.
<0> I thought her acting was terrible in what she did

<0> i'll believe it when i see it
<1> What about Christian music? Is there a date that is recorded for that becoming more popular?
<1> That's good that you are keeping your options open and even better that you challenged yourself to leave comfort and travel.
<0> Well, by 1997, more than 16 million were sold so I don't think they could be too hard to come by.
<0> yea i read a lot of animals are hamred during vegetable farming too!
<0> Yeah ! Another fact about body hair is that the growth of androgenic hair is related to the level of androgens

<0> For a list of water sports, some people participate in triathlons which includes swimming.

<0> Mom's got all the beach paraphernalia, umbrella, cooler on wheels, music to go...she's a Phenom! I'm looking forward to it!
<0> The Jazz is originated from New York.

<1> Me neither, I hate tanning, I always burn.
<0> No i have not made it, what is that?
<0> Wow, I'll have to check it out. But tonight is a classic Jazz night.

<1> i love thunderstorms, it is raining right now
<1> You're welcome, you've been very friendly today.
<0> This last two years, however, we've had the best handheld games I've ever seen!
<0> That sounds like fun. But I don't like to dance.
<0> Yes. I am Brand Loyal as well.
<0> It was very scary,  i'm terrified of spiders. What are you afraid of?
<0> yeah . i think since i'm only 23 there's plenty of time to learn .
<0> all my time is on dancing i love it
<0> I know right, brown hair is also pretty common in Australian Aborigines and Melanesian 
<1> Really,i have not had the experience of buying used stuff before.
<0> I've been in an apartment ever since I broke up with my partner.
<0> I think it is a good trauma cause to this day it keeps me working hard for my dreams so that I will never have to be in that place again.
<1> Is that time efficient?
<1> I prefer to not dye my hair, I can't wait for the rest of my gray hairs to grow
<0> Same here. Thankfully I get to relax tommorow.
<1> Oh really? I always though it was yellow.
<1> Movies are a really inexpensive way to be entertained.
<0> I have a pretty stable job myself, but mostly desk work

<0> Yes, very important. I hope they deliver it soon, I never got any updates or notifications about it.
<1> i do not knit .
<0> the so many varieties of brown hair is not good at all at least we should have one or two so that we can differentiate them.
<1> They're not very smart, probably because they're very young.
<0> Mostly sports psychology, I am a big sports fan.
<0> My favorite brand is Harley-Davidson. It was the first motorcycle I ever rode.
<0> I read a lot now. Read history books for fun. 
<1> those are really nice names . i really like them .
<0> That is true, we cannot be so genetically bad that our rates are so much higher
<0> They'd be better neighbors if they stopped arguing all the time.
<1> the raptors and the indians who lost tonight .
<0> Yeah for sure,  that's why I always like to be happy 
<0> True,  but she's very sensitive. I'm sure it still bothers her. I try to make up for it today,  but I never can take those things back.
<0> Lucky you - I need to rely on public transport or my neighbors to take me places, since I have no family to help me.
<1> Yeah we all do but we can only go forward
<1> It's nice to spend time at home with family. I am always working so I don't see my kids much.
<0> the foreign relations of the PRC have led to great frictions between all nations, no one wants to mess with them for fear of economic distabilization
<1> oh , so it is the people , not the academia , that you are having a problem with ?
<0> shall we plan for next weekend ? it is only like a 15 hour drive .
<0> It was super creepy,  I did not take the offer !
<0> Cheese pizza is my favorite, way better with no meat
<1> More unique homes. It seems every division of homes you see now all look the same. I would like to be able to build neighborhoods that look more custom made
<0> Love rock music. i do enjoy others but always come back. Whats your favorite band? 
<0> Definitely, but only because sugary drinks tend to have a lot of calories! They even call sweetened beverages "liquid candy". It's that bad!
<0> I never heard of Snoop Dogg, who is he?
<0> True! I guess I mean how some see red and think of desire, others think of danger...
<1> I bet pets are amazing. They're hard to replace once they're a part of the family
<0> That's a terrible job to have if I'm being honest.
<0> I bake cakes also and bread using grainthe fifth and sixth centuries BCE, the ancient Greeks used enclosed ovens heated by wood 
<0> Oh, I absolutely hate volunteering.
<1> I have blonde hair, that is interesting!
<1> It's a lot of irritation to put up with considering how expensive it is to go to the movies now!
<1> That's cool. My uncle is an actor too
<1> Lol I love it. Have you have been to one before
<0> I never played sports in high school. I was in the marching band though.
<0> My phone fell off the stairs,  so I was expectant of getting a new one

<0> next week. and i am starting next month. i am looking forward to the new city and life
<0> Pasta is so basic. Now a fat juicy steak and baked potato is my favorite dish. Nothing better then that!
<0> Child care supervision is of importance ,not minding the cost.
<1> Do you think he was panhandling you for money or a person who really needed it? Did you give him money?
<0> Yes. I also love tropical place with nice warm weather, blue water and such as south florida
<1> you should visit colorado where i live . it is very pretty here .
<0> The red panda is not related to the giant panda. Whereas the giant panda belongs to Family: Ursidae (Bears), the red panda belongs to its own taxonomically unique Family: Ailuridae
<1> No thanks, I'm not actually that big of a fan.
<1> Do you think ther will be any fun in that?
<1> I have plenty of time. I just found out I was pregnant.
<0> I hate movies that were made before the year 2000.
<0> It was developed last year.
<1> You shouldn't have done that to him. It is not right at all.
<1> what happened then ?
<0> Well I spoke to her dad. The car was totaled. No word on the other driver. It wasn't local to our county so not on our news.
<0> you can get it for free if you have spotify premium'
<0> I work retail. Wish i could be reading for money instead, but it pays the bills.
<0> good for you! Stay sober, my friend! because someone who abstains from alcohol but wants to start drinking again isn't truly sober
<1> Yeah,  that sounds annoying. Maybe try to scold the dog so they won't do it again?
<0> not yet im still looking for it
<1> I haven't been to any countries and neither has anyone I know.
<0> Wow that is cool. I knew it has been in New York before.
<0> Yeah, I've seen many black people where I live that have different colors of hair.
<0> Ah how do you make scratch hummus?
<0> How was it staying by the Lake Michigan that is one of the greatest lakes in the United States?
<1> Are they all Yeezys?
<0> That is great, hope you can take my kids to disney world.
<0> That's a long time ago.  So, does that mean the Aztecs grew it?
<0> anything planned for your afternoon ?
<1> I don't want to know about your experiences. Never interest me
<0> Keep doing my best in whatever i do. I'm sure all shall be well.
<0> Me too.  I always take baths because I hate showers.
<1> I sometimes eat bad food to satisfy my cravings
<1> My wife is a teacher so maybe you can ask her for help with your studies
<0> Right! It's almost like,  you knew this was going to happen. I feel terrible but it was so good lol. I'll get him some more tomorrow!
<0> No kidding. Forget my birthday, I might just set up a nice evening for her.
<1> The beach is my most favorite place to go.
<0> I like the balayage technique, it looks really natural. I have a lot of gray hair to color as well, and hair color does not attach well sometimes to gray hair. 
<0> I wonder if there are any symptoms beyond just being tired all the time?
<0> My supervisor warned me earlier in the week about it
<1> Yes, old. Sorry. I just hate Honda's. Always breaking down.
<1> sounds delicious , i should try it sometime
<0> Pretty small as well! Just 4 of us, how did you end up in Missouri?
<1> Our life is so amazing right now , I don t see why your disgusted. 
<0> Me too, I find it absolutely disgusting.
<0> Unfortunately I kept getting looks! It's alright though!
<0> Yes. I do enjoy swimming during the summer months to cool off, but don't think I would do well competitively.
<0> I'm sorry to say I haven't played it but I do enjoy trying new things. I will definitely check it out! 
<0> I know that the Aztecs are a very recent civilization.
<0> I am a red head do they have thick hair?
<0> It was a Marilyn Manson concert. I was even dancing by myself.
<1> I wouldn't have done anything to help it either. I don't really like animals.
<0> i visit my sister every year in canada
<0> That sounds like a great idea for me. Specially here in Ohio, you can find many natural trails
<0> It gives attendees the opportunity to walk the exhibit hall and observe different games.
<0> i Don't have Friend 
<1> I go to the farmer's market every weekend to raise funds for poverty in third world countries. What about you?
<1> I dont care if you or not. 
<1> I wish I could have visited it. I've never been to Chicago.
<0> I'm sure it's in even more popular in the U.S.
<1> oh I forgot there was cream cheese in the brownies too.  These brownies were more of a fudge like texture but some brownies I have made used the almond flour and baking powder to get the bready texture you are talking about
<1> Probably not, but I'm a vegetarian so I don't have to worry about getting sick from eating meat.
<0> Sounds great, well it's been nice to chat to you -  maybe we'll meet at a swing club sometime in the future?!
<1> Me either.
<0> Nah I usually eat junk from McDonalds and local pizza places. You?
<0> I dislike any type of candy they trouble my stomach
<0> I did apologise to him the next day,  and I had a lot of making up to do. I don't usually get nasty when I drink alcohol,  but this has made me be more careful 
<1> It's true. Even indie comics are doing better, but its still a rough market. 
<0> So is iron oxide, which gives Mars its red color.
<0> Science Theater was a big hit. 
<0> Minnesota of all places? Huh, that's cool.
<1> Python is actually very versitile as a high level language. I'd call it more "powerful" than C++, but it may not be a good choice when computing resources are at a premium.
<0> I've never wanted to visit Texas either, it doesn't seem like somewhere i'd want to go. 
<0> Not sure but can tell you the ancient Romans were mass producing bread.
<0> It was a very low key night. Nothing exciting happened. 
<0> Yes and I think they have them in a lot of different states, but I hear the San Diego one is the best one.
<1> We can always use extra help there. If you ever have free time you should stop by
<0> why not sing them now ? time passes quickly .
<1> I have visited some of these comic con events. People show off their best costumes of their favorite heroes.
<0> Not sure,  hopefully I hear this upcoming week. I feel pretty good about my chances so that's making the waiting a little easier.
<1> Glad to hear it, long hair can be so disgusting and is never attractive if's good you're avoiding it.
<0> Yeah, I don't like the color red either. 
<1> yeah,  and the people in charge don't get paid enough to always check up and repair them
<1> thas cool! i prefer to stick with traditional art
<0> I feel old enough for a dog.
<0> Me? Mostly I like playing with sharp weapons lol
<0> Yeah it is. Will be having my 35th birthday next week.
<1> I don't go to church currently.  I am not really the religious type.
<0> Yes, I agree. Now they're are a lot of stay-at-home dads. You know, where the dad doesn't work and the mom does.
<0> That's cool! My brother and I watch football together, too!
<1> I don't work in the university
<0> I'm not sure. I'm not very into science.
<1> I'm a nurse in a doctor's office. What do you do?
<0> not really i dont travel much i work a lot but i love the summer still because i get to do other activities to stay active
<0> I took him out to dinner later on,  he's a good friend
<0> What your favorite book.
<0> i do too,  it's normal to runaway and sit in front of your computer i guess
<0> If I do damage them, what kinds of hair root remedies or treatments are out there?
<1> Not really, I couldn't even name one of the primary colors if I wanted
<1> i like mexican food , but i eat salads a lot to watch my diet .
<1> I like to read, go hiking and I got married last year and he likes to play golf so I am trying to get into that now. 
<1> Whatever, that's not my problem.
<0> I think it's probably a safe bet that I won't
<0> It really was. At least my friend learned a lot about computers as we built it together!
<0> smoothies with banana and honey. Do you like to eat healthy?
<1> I'm studying to become a pediatrician myself, maybe we'll cross paths!
<1> No thanks, I hate dogs.
<0> OK, but I do not even like wine anyways.
<0> nonexistent . i used to be a party king , but had to drop out of that life
<1> I will be looking forward to that because I am always ready for that kind of stuff.
<1> I love blue heelers but my parakeet is multicoloured. Have you ever had gummy bears, their my favourite and somehow always reminds me of Lassie.
<1> That must be fun. I wish I can enjoy it as much as you do. When was the last time you went on a hike?
<0> I'd love to, but I don't leave my own house.
<0> Grapes are bad for wines
<0> Well,  not really according to analytics. I was really let down by the fact that it was a flop but I'm not going to let it drag me down too much.
<0> It was a presentation that had to be quickly put together.  My supervisor seemed pleased
<1> My gradma was such a prude that I couldn't stand to be around her. 
<1> I'm more of a fan of the past than the present. I like the Victorian era.
<1> That does sound fun, sometimes i wish i had kids.
<0> I know a lot about it.
