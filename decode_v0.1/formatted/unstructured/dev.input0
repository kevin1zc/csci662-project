<0> Red and orange are great colors <1> Yes, I like too. Bur blue is the best I think. <0> Color theory has some interesting thoughts on color mixing in visual effects. <1> I dont really know about color theory but it looks very interesting. <0> The idea has been known as far back as Leonardo daVinci in the 15th Century. <1> I am sure you are some kind of artist. Or maybe photograher. <0> I visited Florence in Tuscany to see the birthplace of Renaissance painting. <1> I have been in Florence too but many year ago. Really a great place to visit. <0> It is hard to believe there are over 1 million in the city. <1> Florence is a nice place to visit once all the virus are gone
<0> I have faith the Eagles will be good this year, I hope it goes well! <1> Well I hope they play well for you :) <0> Are you a big sports person? <1> Not much. My three roommates are, but I prefer birds. <0> Oh nice. Birds are cool. I like to collect stamps from different countries. <1> what stamps have you collected?
<0> One of my coworkers was outright belligerent today. <1> That sucks! What were they upset about?
<0> I have brown hair. It is very common in human beings. <1> Same here, brown hair is super common too. <0> That's what I said, haha. I wish I had red hair. I think it looks really cool. <1> My bad haha. I think so too, red hair is not nearly as common as brown or black hair but I wish it was. <0> I think red hair is mostly present in northern climates. It is pretty rare where I live. <1> I better move there then haha. Also brown hair can really vary in color for light to almost black. <0> Mine is on the lighter side. The sun makes it look almost blonde at times. <1> Me too! My brown hair used to be blonde when I was younger.
<0> My math teacher told the class I needed to do better on my next test. <1> Well you should try to study more and see what happens
<0> Yes, but what is your opinion of it? What are your thoughts on the pracitce? <1> poaching was performed by impoverished peasants for subsistence purposes and a supplement for meager diets. <0> Ouch. Wow. I suppose that is true though <1> Yes, we need to start teaching about this from a young age in schools. <0> Yea, maybe they wont do it in the future <1> That's probably true, but who knows in this country. <0> Honestly, history seems to repeat itself here anyway <1> i agree . another thing we can do to fix the world we live in . <0> Yeah, we do seem to have too many ongoing problems in our country.
<0> Hey! I love listening to music, specifically rap. One of my favorite rappers is Snoop Dogg.  <1> I don't know a lot about Snoop Dogg but I do know his career began in 1992 as he was discovered by Dr. Dre. <0> Really? That is interesting! I am a big fan of Dr. Dre as well.  <1> Yes, Dr. Dre is the current CEO of Aftermath Entertainment. <0> Yeah he is. remember I'm a huge fan.
<0> I used to have quite the problem with overeating, as I used to be pretty chubby myself. Have you had that issue? <1> Fortunately I've been able to avoid that problem. I know it can be a big issue during the holidays, as many people tend to overeat during those times. <0> That's true, since there are so many gigantic meals during that time and people don't care as much. <1> It can also happen during festivals because people have built up so much anticipation to the event, and we even encourage overeating sometimes, for instance Thanksgiving. <0> We certainly do encourage overeating in some cases, but it seems to be very rare and it seems like weight loss stuff is really popular around that time too.
<0> The Italians know how to make an amazing sports car, I love Ferrari's <1> Wow I didn't know we made those cars. lol <0> Their Scuderia Ferrari team handles formula one racing parts and other things, it's very competative. <1> Nice. I live in the US but I am Italian. I think Ferrari's are beautiful especially in red or black. Do you have a color preference? <0> Enzo Ferrari, the reator was actually a pro racer himse,lf he founded the Scuderia Ferrari Grand Prix team <1> Cool! Do they win alot? Any what is your favorite color?
<0> my doggie recently passed away <1> I'm so sorry to hear that! Hopefully he or she wasn't in too much pain at the end. <0> no i don't think so,  but it was violent.  she was run over by a car.  
<0> A bunch of fruit flies appeared in my apartment out of nowhere the other day. I think it's because of some old veggies in my fridge. Totally gross. <1> Oh man,  those things are awful and reproduce like crazy.  We left our house for a week and came back to tons of them everywhere! The best trick is putting a little apple cider vinegar in a jar,  a drop of dish soap on top of that and cover it with cling wrap and put holes in it.  They will gravitate toward it and you'll catch a bunch! Just keep changing it every few days. <0> Thanks for the tip,  I will try that! I cleaned out the fridge and most of them seemed to just go away. I have no idea where they go but don't really care either as long as they're gone! <1> Seriously,  gone is good.  They do have bacteria on them and lay their eggs on fruit and veggies and the larva burrow into the fruit or veggie so its good you trashed it all. Glad you're free of them! <0> Yeah, they were flying around and being annoying!
<0> Nothing really, it's just a weekly thing for me, although I did just finish my accounting final project, so there is that. <1> You should celebrate with a drink! I find it hilarious that nearly every civilization has independently discovered the processes of making beer, wine and spirits. <0> I enjoy writing childrens books as a hobby and also enjoying drinking goes hand in hand. It makes me more creative lol. <1> That's when the creative juicy's flow lol. I sometimes do crazy things when I drink like a little late night riding on my mountain bike. <0> That sounds fun actually! I have to watch myself though, cause if someone gives me bad stimuli while drinking, I can have a bad mouth. <1> Ooooh yes I agree with you on that. The craziest thing when I drink I crave boiled eggs, so weird. <0> lol, really? I haven't heard that one before. I crave carbs it seems, like chips or crackers the most, for sure. <1> Yes, it is soooo weird. Chips sound so good right now lol I swear <0> Maybe I'll try to center my next book around chip cravings in some way or another! What's your favorite potato chip?
<0> just finished reading a book to my child <1> what book did you read ? <0> We read the Bible. There is a lot of good information there. <1> Have you read Fantastic Mr. Fox? Such a great kids book. Really anything by Roald Dahl <0> I have not read it. What age group is it aimed at? <1> I would say 5-10. There's also a movie so that could be fun for the kids to know the story first and then see the movie as a fun activity <0> I may have to get it and read to the grandkids. IF I can find time as I am trying to get a law degree. <1> Well I'm sure you are doing plenty of reading on your own already. Maybe get them an audio book to put them to sleep XD <0> I prefer to read to and with them. NOTHNG is more important than people. <1> That's very good. I'd like to see more parents interacting with their children instead of plopping a phone in front of them <0> It is very disturbing the way all of society clings to their phones. I enjoy playing tennis to get away.
<0> It's high time i get my self a girlfriend, i feel so bored up <1> Are you trying to go out and meet some ladies  <0> Yeah,  i'm so ready to date.I want to meet my person. <1> That is the first step. What you have to do next is be at your best behavior always  <0> I just try my best, hope to meet a pretty lady.
<0> how are you tonight let us chat shall we . <1> yes , we shall ! what are you up to ? <0> i broke up with my fiance two months ago . <1> i'm listening to britney spears . i love her ! i'm sorry to hear that . <0> yes me to britney is great . i have a lot of pet fish . <1> i demand a lot , high maintenance , so you do not want to date me ! <0> my favorite color i like so much is orange . <1> i spend money like it grows on trees ! then there's the tanning beds , diets , etc .
<0> Hair dyeing, coloring, whatever you want to call it, I have purple hair now. <1> Purple! Lol I have platinum blonde that I maintain with purple shampoo, so sometimes if I leave it in too long it turns purplish <0> I don't think I could pull off that color (which I love!), but I got tired of people complaining about the grey hairs popping up, so I figured I'd show them! <1> Haha! That is funny! I found a grey hair but just one and its because I have a toddler, I shouldnt be getting those yet! <0> See, always thought it was just associated with age, but I'm in the same boat as you.  I got a dash more grey with each kid, and maybe a few pounds heavier as well. <1> Oh no! How many do you have? I cant even think about doing this all over again, and then again, and then again, NOOOO <0> i have just a few barely noticeable
<0> I was thinking about how I missed my grandma <1> I have the same feeling. I miss her also
<0> I don't think I have. Are you referring to like chicken broth? <1> Right like a liquid broth for chicken or beef or even vegetable.  It is actually quite tasty! <0> Have you ever made your own broth at home? It's pretty easy and a great way to use the leftovers from cooking. <1> I have! I have made it at my boyfriends house, but we did not do too well! What flavours do you like?\ <0> I really like to add a little anise in the broth but my wife doesn't <1> Perhaps some Vino with it? <0> For a beef broth I'll use a red wine, but I prefer a white wine for chicken or veggie stock <1> Napa wine is pretty good, but it is so juvenile compared to wine from Italy that goes back centuries! I mean, Napa was first made a city in 1872. <0> It may be a young city, but its old soil that has been used for centuries to grow high quality crops <1> I agree, I love farms because it feels so natural. <0> It's nice to get to experience the rich soil and wholesome smells. <1> that's true ! what do you do for work ?
<0> they sure do , i'm retired computer programmer so i go all out . <1> that is fun do you like music <0> I love the old tunes, back from when I was young <1> Nice, I play the violin and love music as well. <0> My granddaughter plays the violin! <1> Cool, well my grandmother raised me so that's neat. I like 80s music a lot. <0> I do like them.
<0> I may never know who she was. <1> Never know who was? <0> The women that hit my car and left before the police came. <1> Wow that is aweful!  <0> she was evil and left
<0> Black hair is the most common color and the darkest hair color <1> Really?  Tell me more about this. <0> Black hair is a dominant trait and is found in people of all ethnicities <1> That makes sense. I wonder what is least common? <0> In English black hair is described as raven black or jet black <1> Raven black.  Interesting terminology.  <0> Skin colors associated with black hair range from pale to dark skin <1> Tell me more about raven black hair.
<0> cool , i will be there soon . . cannot wait ! <1> be prepareared to rock roll ! <0> I wish I had more money to travel, because that is my dream.  <1> I'm not great at saving money to travel, but it would be nice. <0> I have an IQ of 250 and enjoy visiting museums and concerts. <1> That's great you are very smart. Do you like concerts or museums more?
<0> I have brown hair and I wear wigs and extensions <1> I just love thick curly brown hair with brown eyes <0> But a lot of people think I should go with blonde instead of brown hair. But I like my brown hair <1> is your hair a natural brown hair, or do you color it ? <0> yes it natrualy brown but I been thinking about adding some other colors with streaks of brown in it <1> That may be very appealing. Brunettes are pretty as well. Lots of French girls wear pixie haircuts and their hair is a brown :) <0> Yea it is but I guess i am trying to keep my brown hair but satisfy other people as well <1> Brown hair is appealing, but you should always satisfy yourself and not others. Black is a pretty color as well <0> I think lighter colors like light brown on me keeps me looking young.  I am 46 years old after all
<0> Superman is probably the greatest DC superhero, am I right? What can't he do, assuming there's no Kryptonite nearby? <1> I know right, Superman is amazing, I couldn't imagine his childhood and him realizing he has superhuman abilities <0> Exactly! Luckily his adoptive parents were super (ha) supportive of him as he grew up. They always knew what was best for him. <1> They gave him such a strong moral compass, which luckily for everyone else, made him good instead of evil lol <0> Yep, they and Lois Lane. Have you read many of the original Superman comics? <1> I have not, it would be amazing to own an Action Comics #1, it came out in 1938!

<0> Hi <1> jazz is a music genre that originated in the African AMERICAN COMMUNITIES <0> Interesting. Do you enjoy Jazz? <1> oh yes, i enjoy it, it si seen by many as America's classical music <0> What is your favorite style of Jazz? <1> my favourite is the call and response vocals <0> Awesome. I enjoy Chicago style Jazz  <1> me too,Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the black experience of the United States,  <0> Yes. True. I play the trumpet, do you play any instruments?
<0> i was disgusted at the way the man was staring at me non-stop <1> That's unfortunate. Some people just cannot help but act rude. <0> yes,  and i ended up getting a different taxi,  i lost my money
<0> hey , jefferson here , just got off work as a museum tour guide . <1> wow that is cool mr . i'm only 4 <0> oh . do you like roses ? i've some in my garden . <1> yeah flowers are okay . my mom got me turtle <0> did they get you any fancy tea ? i love that . <1> i hate flowers

<0> im envious of everyone who is outside enjoying the sun right now <1> Yea I hear ya. Im stuck here at work for another day too. <0> same here,  but the weekend will be fun <1> I just hope it doesnt rain this weekend. <0> I'm okay with it raining, I like staying inside all day.
<0> i do want to move to spain , study there and then teach english there afterwards though . <1> you do not have to move to spain , you can actually teach english virtually <0> Really? <1> Yes. Teaching online is quite common now. For someone who enjoy dancing like me I can do both as a job. <0> I really want to be able to travel all over the world to teach the learnings <1> and you can do that! it's not hard at all. 
<0> Hi, I own a Ferrari, an Italian sports car. Do you? <1> No i do not. But i wish to have one. Which type of ferrari do you own <0> I own a 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO, most expensive car in history! <1> Wow. you must have some loads of money. What feature on it makes it so special and expensive?  <0> The fact that it was powered by Ferrari's Tipo 168/62 V12 engine. A very powerful engine indeed! <1> Well maybe. How fast can it go?
<0> i like organic food how about you . <1> how are you on this very cold night ? <0> fine really thank you for asking . <1> i like organic food also i meditate everyday . <0> oh do you now . i happen to like yoga . <1> i stop working to follow buddhist spirituality all the time . <0> oh i see . i try to keep a healthy life style . <1> i just moved to alaska six months ago . <0> Oh really? how's the weather over there?
<0> Hi. I have brown hair. <1> That's nice. Is it long or short hair? <0> I guess that depends on where you're from. Long hair is a concet thaat varies culturally. <1> That's true. I guess I would rephrase it as do you have shoulder length hair or longer? <0> It's about to my shoulders. I think most Americans would say medium. On a guy it would be "long." <1> My friend recently cut off 8 inches of hair to donate to cancer patients so I was curious about hair length.  <0>  Like, 40% of people get cancer, can you believe it? <1> WOW! That's higher than I thought. Do you think we'll ever have a cure??
<0> I moved to northern Alaska last year and don't know anyone.  <1> you havent met all three people in the city yet? <0> haha. I live about 1 hour south of Barrow the most northern place in the USA and about 12 hours north of any actual city. 
<0> I went to a baseball game with my favorite team a few weeks ago. They had been doing pretty badly in the first half. Somehow they managed to pull it together and win in the end! That made me very happy! <1> That's awesome! Sometimes pulling through a tough battle is more satisfying than just winning outright! Shows perseverance and a "never give up" attitude. <0> I agree, perseverance si a key human motivator. It can turn the outcome and can potentially make the underdo the winner.  <1> I know a lot of people root for the underdog, but I prefer games where there is no clear favorite. Fair, even, matches are more interesting to watch. <0> I tend to agree,a fair even match is just the right kinda match, like a perfect suspense movie. <1> I hope the Superbowl this year is an even match, some of the past years have been disappointing. <0> Oh yeah, nothing against the patriots but the superbowl has gotten a bit boring seeing them numerous times. I need some fresh teams. <1> Remember a few years back when the Colts played the Bears? Disappointing game but awesome half-time show - my favorite artist played. <0>  i feel like superbowl is trying to attract more people to the game, by having an attractive half time show , along with non football related things. <1> I think Jennifer Lopez and Shakira are playing the show this year. <0> that is cool, i will be checking it out for sure, now we need a good game.  <1> yeah you need to check it out
<0> I am so scared of clowns. What can you tell me about them? <1> Well, they're just comic performers who use slapstick comedy. Not really much to be afraid of to be honest. <0> Maybe it is the movie It that caused my fears. <1> There are various traditions in costume and performance for clowns. I guess you're talking about the Stephen King movie, It? <0> That is correct. Pennywise looks so creepy. I know it's just a movie but I'm afraid there is a real killer clown. <1> Thankfully clowns aren't really like that. That would be terrifying!
<0> I have been trying to lose my pregnancy weight recently and just started a new exercise program this week. <1> Do you do any strength training to help lose weight? <0> Only tiny 5 pound weights for my arms while I am cycling <1> That sounds like a good starting place. Just keep gradually increasing the weight. <0> I think it will be a while before that. I'm trying to increase the reps first. <1> Muscle growth should be faster if you increase the weight until muscle failure instead of reps. <0> How does that effect fat burning? <1> Muscle burns fat.
<0> just heard I got the promotion I was hoping for. I think I am going to burst. <1> oh that is so exciting!!! good for you man! <0> thanks,  i thing I am going to celebrate when I get home tonight <1> yeah pop that champagne! <0> this promotion is so sweet, i'm so happy.
<0> hello ! who am i speaking with today ? <1> hi , my name is taylor . you might know my dad , he was a construction worker . <0> i may very well . what he in the military ? i was . <1> no , do you like coffee ? because i love it ! <0> no . i don't drink coffee . <1> what ? well how about alcohol , i hate alcohol and the color pink <0> I do not drink alcohol and do like the color pink
<0> Hai <1> hair coloring changes your hair color <0> Yes <1> main reason people color their hair is to cover grey or white hair <0> I am cover with grey color <1> hair coloring is either done at home or at salon/professional
<0> hello , i finally got a chance to use the internet ! tell me about yourself . <1> hey , good for you ! me ? well , i love my cats . all five of them , lol . <0> i want to see my cat ! at least my moms is visiting soon . have you been arrested ? <1> arrested ? ! ? you think so . . . lol . no , they have not caught me yet . <0> i am in here for shoplifting , with a month to go . what have you got away with ? <1> my dad taught me a lot . even how to stay out of jail , fortunately ! lol . . <0> i wish i knew my dad . do you have any tips for staying out of trouble ? <1> sure . don't do drugs . don't be stupid . get married and obey your wife . simple . <0> sounds kind of boring ! what do you do for fun ?
<0> I'm afraid I've never heard of him. Can you tell me a little about him? <1> You must have heard his song "Shape of you", it's very popular now.. He was born in England and he attended the academy of contemporary music  <0> Oh yeah I'v heard of that one. My son plays it on repeat 24/7! <1> He was in an episode of Game of Thrones as well <0> I love that show. Have not had time to finish it yet but I hear the ending is not the best. <1> It was not how i wanted it to end. Maybe you will enjoy it? <0> Maybe. All the complaints I've heard kind of sapped my enthusiasm for watching the last season, though.
<0> I love Snoop Dogg, have you ever heard of him? <1> I sure have. I'm not incredibly familiar with his work as a singer/songwriter, but I really like Snoop Dogg's personality and business sense. <0> He's sure made a lot of money from his connection to marijuana. I really like his song Gin and Juice. <1> Was that on his debut album "Doggystyle?" <0> Yes it was, have you listened to the whole album? 
<0> Red is the color at the end of the visible spectrum of light. <1> I love the color red! <0> Reds range from scarlet and vermillion to crimson, and vary in shade from pink to burgundy. <1> I wonder how they obtain red dye. <0> In the Renaissance, red costumes for the wealthy were dyed with kermes and cochineal. <1> I wonder what other meanings red takes on. <0> Roman generals had their bodies colored red to celebrate victories. <1> Why do you think a stop sign is red? <0> It used to be yellow, but was changed to red to go along with the color-coding system used with railroads. <1> Thats a good fact, yellow is a lovely color
<0> My favorite food is pasta. It is a noodle made from unleavened dough. <1> Yes; I am a pasta eater too.  I shouldn't have the carbs, I guess; but pasta is great.  Spaghetti is among my favorite meals. <0> I love spaghetti. It is a long, thin, cylindical form of pasta. <1> Yes; I am also a fan of fettuccine, too.  What about you?  Is there much difference between fettuccine and spaghetti? <0> Fettuccina is a type of pasta popular in Tuscan cousine. The shape is flatter than spaghetti. <1> Interesting.  What other types of pastas are there? <0> Pasta can be divided into dry and fresh pasta. Water is added to dry pasta for cooking. My favorite type of pasta is lasagna. <1> What is fresh pasta?  I don't think I am familiar with that.
<0> My friend is so lucky,  he always seems to be winning lotteries and gambles of sorts. <1> Man.. i need some of that luck! <0> Same here. Just last week,  he won over $400 playing slot machines,  and I really wish that could've been me. <1> Wow thats awesome! i never win anything like that <0> Do you play the lottery?
<0> Hi, I'm looking to buy a Harley bike. Have you any suggestions? <1> Any Harley is a good choice with their style of customization. <0> Nice, I want one that is really loud.  <1> Well, their customization can do that for you but you may have trouble with your local laws! <0> True, I don't want to get into trouble. Which Harley is your favorite?
<0> hi i am sady and i've a huge library at home . <1> hi sady ! i am kay and i love garth brooks . <0> i started to become partly deaf in my right year <1> so sorry ! i wasn't allowed to listen to rock music when i was young . <0> yeah it happens with old age . i work as a tour guide in a museum <1> what museum ? did i mention that i love shania twain as well ? <0> it is an art museum <1> i've always wanted to see the metropolitan museum of art . <0> yea it is so beautiful

What do you gamble on? 
<0> I want you to know that my favorite color is red. <1> That's cool! Red is a primary color and is the complementary color of cyan. <0> Have you ever seen a red panda? They are rather amazing. <1> I have never seen a red panda although I understand it has reddish-brown fur and a long shaggy tail. <0> Yes, did you know that China owns all pandas in the world? We only have them in zoos because we lease them. <1> I understand that panda diplomacy is how China diplomatically gifts pandas to other countries. <0> Yes, this is true but still only for a lease. Any babys the panda has still belongs to china. It is truly a weird thing. Red pandas are the best for this reason. <1> Why are red pandas better considering this reason? <0> I'm not really sure.
<0> I  just bought a Ferrari - what an awesome Italian sports car ! <1> Whoa! Congrats man. I bet it's really fun to drive? <0> It's amazing!  It was rated the world's most powerful brand in 2014! <1> How long have Ferrari's been made? Do you get lots of attention from other guys or girls? <0> I get attention from everyone!  LOL  The company was founded in 1939 out of Alfa Romeo's race division <1> Nice. Do you know how many horse power it has? <0> No, I don't - but I do know that the most expensive car in history was the 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO  <1> Why was it expensive? Because it was rare or just a very good quality vehicle?
<0> i have a wife but she does not like me very much <1> my wife do not like me either she loves our 2 cats and the dog more <0> i'm sure she likes you more than you think <1> Yes, I agree with you on that but and she loves me regardless. <0> that's really nice to hear. i have 2 cats and a dog as well. <1> Oh wow do you. Do you have to chase after them at all? I can't do pets I hate running lol. <0> my cats are pretty lazy but my dog is high energy and i take him on at least 2 walks a day for 30 minutes each <1> Lol that sounds like a cat to me, lazy.

<0> I have light brown hair, and have often fought against it. I would love either lighter or brown so brown it's almost black! <1> Do you want to go for hair dye? <0> Highlights, maybe. But as far as *changing* my color by dyeing it -- I haven't been tempted yet! But it's nice to know there are options! <1> Yes since you don't feel comfortable with the color of your hair, dyeing can be an option <0> It's not that I don't feel comfortable -- I just sometimes want to do something *different*. It's super common, obviously, in the Western world -- but variety can be fun. <1> Yes variety can be fun really, sometimes you just feel like doing something different <0> I mean, as a brunette I have thicker hair than blondes typically do -- but not as much as redheads. Speaking of...red could be fun! Is there a color you like? <1> I like black color with a such of golden <0> When was the last time you dyed your hair?
<0> I think the most common hair color is brown, what do you think? <1> You're close! Technically, black is the most common hair color. Brown comes after that. <0> I would think there are many different shades of brown hair between light brown and dark brown <1> There's a lot of variation, especially between different hair colors. Brown hair has high levels of a dark pigment and low levels of a pale pigment. <0> I wonder if two people with brown hair can have a child with different color hair than its parents <1> That's true. If they both have a recessive gene for blonde hair, their child can be blonde!
<0> I know many people think of pasta as Italian, but I love it here in America! <1> There is indefinitely a difference between what American's consider pasta and what Italians consider pasta. <0> Oh, I don't doubt that.

I haven't found any other outlet yet. <0> Have you tried games? I like playing d&d, it's a fun way to connect <1> I've always wanted to try getting into D&D, but I could never find the opportunity to get started <0> Sometimes local game shops will hold open nights!

I like baking bread sometimes, but cakes and cookies are good too. <0> Ohh bread.. Maybe I will make that... How do you make bread? <1> Well you just need some dough, water, and yeast and then you can bake it in the oven, quite simple. <0> You don't need anything else? What if I add pepperoni to it? Do I put in from the start or later on in the cooking process? <1> I wouldn't suggest adding a cure porked and beef mixed-together product in my bread, but I guess you could try, I'd add it in from the start I suppose. <0> I can teach you how to bake if you did not mind.

<0> Superman is probably the greatest DC superhero, am I right? What can't he do, assuming there's no Kryptonite nearby? <1> I know right, Superman is amazing, I couldn't imagine his childhood and him realizing he has superhuman abilities <0> Exactly! Luckily his adoptive parents were super (ha) supportive of him as he grew up. They always knew what was best for him. <1> They gave him such a strong moral compass, which luckily for everyone else, made him good instead of evil lol <0> Yep, they and Lois Lane.

It just goes so well with many color combinations. <0> Oh I know, red also has a dominant wavelength of about 625 to 740 nanometres. <1> Wow, so I wonder if the darker the color the more dominant the wavelength is. <0> Maybe, I don't really know what dominant wavelength means compared to just wavelength. <1> Red really is a popular color to represent power as well. <0> Like you said, it is also a primary color in the RGB color model. <1> I'm glad we are talking about red because it really is one of the best colors!

<0> Hey Im Jim and I am a baker who works at a local bakery. I am pretty smart and know the way of the dough, What would you like to know?  <1> Hi Jim, I am thinking of opening my own bakery since I enjoy baking. Do you think I should sell baked cookies or pizza? <0> I think cookies are a good choice, Just go with the basic ingredients like flour, sugar and some kinda oil.  <1> I see, do I need to marinate the cookies in oil before I serve them? <0> Thats not necessary, You only use the oil to mix with the dough, it makes the cookie less dry and gives it a nice smooth taste. Also use it to prevent the cookies from sticking to the pan.  <1> Thanks for the tip, I have big trouble with dough that sticks to the pan and doesn't come off! Should I serve sushi along with cookies? <0> I never really thought of it, but that does sounds good just as long as you have Sushi with the basics like brown or white rice. Dont add any sauces or it might clash with the taste of the cookies.  <1> I am just worried that serving sushi without Wasabi sauce might make my customers angry. Do you think a bit of Wasabi sauce is okay?
<0> i have brown hair but i dye it black <1> Brown hair is actually the second most popular hair color after black!

It can range from a light brown to nearly black. That's pretty broad I think. <0> yes, i agree!  <1> I never realized until recently that brown hair strands are actually thicker than those of fair hair. I thought they were all the same! <0> that's interesting. i learned something new today :) do you know any other cool facts? <1> People with brown hair are known as brunette. That term came from the French word brunet! 
<0> Hi, I love pasta. Do you? <1> Absolutely! Pasta is a staple of Italian cuisine and one of my very favorite foods. <0> Yes its so easy to make!

I didn't know that, is pasta very popular in the U.S? <1> Definitely. Although it began in Italy, pasta has had a tremendous influence on American cuisine. <0> Yes lots of Italian dishes have influenced U.S. culture. Pizza is another one I think. <1> Yes, pizza is said to be invented in Naples, Italy, but America has developed their own styles, like NY style and Chicago deep-dish.

<0> The aftermath was awful.  Trash and debris was everywhere and we were homeless.  We lived out in the country and it took some time before red cross came out to do their report and get help to us. <1> That sounds terrible. I hope you're okay now. <0> I am doing better now but it was really hard times.  We had moved everything up higher as we never expected our whole house to go.  Unfortunately we had all our belongings in the house as well. <1> Well all the matters is that no one was hurt. You can buy property again but not lives. <0> That is very true.

<0> It is such a privilege to be able to help someone in any way you can. <1> Indeed. It makes you feel good when you can help somebody else with their problem <0> It also makes me feel bad when i'm unable to help. <1> I think if everybody in the world offered a hand of help to one another,  we would not have much problem
<0> ever feel so full of emotions when looking at old pictures? <1> Yeah.  reminds me of the good old days!   <0> for me it's when you get more than just nostalgia,  when you get sad,  happy and sentimental  <1> Yeah same here.  I remember one time awhile back I took some pictures of when the aliens landed in my backyard.   That was some good times! <0> Aliens in your backyard?!?
<0> Have you ever colored your hair.?  Dyeing it black, red, brown for example. <1> no but I am curious <0> If you are curious perhaps you should start with a natural dye.  It's plant based so less harsh. <1> What causes this? <0> The natural color from things like berries, bark give off a color to the hair when applied. <1> Is there a remedy? <0> No not a remedy.  It's just a pigmentation color given to the hair.  Mainly for style preference.  <1> So which plants is it made of?
<0> There are a few really good dramas on Showtime Networks, which is a part of CBS.  Do you watch Showtime at all? <1> Yes I do I really like Shameless <0> Yes I like Shameless.  William Macy is hilarious!  I also like Homeland, Billions and The Affair.  You watch any of those? <1> I was interested in the affair but I am more into HBO at the moment. He is a great actor! <0> HBO has been around since 1972!  What shows do you like on HBO? My favorite was The Wire. <1> I really liked True Blood, Girls, Succession, and especially Game Of Thrones <0> I have been trying to catch up on Game of Thrones, I am on season 4 I think.  Can't believe it is ended in 2019. <1> You might be disappointed in the last season of Game of Thrones. 
<0> Did you graduate high school? It's a lot harder than most people think. <1> Sure I did! It takes determation to succeed <0> I didn't think I woudl have to do that much studying. I figured that came later in college.  <1> So if not by studying , what else? <0> I thought it was mostly fun and games, now I'm worried I will not graduate.

<0> My next door neighbor is so inconsiderate!  He plays loud music at all hours of the night! <1> Did you speak to him about it? <0> yeah. i have. countless number of times over. <1> Was she at all understanding? <0> he just pretends to hear what i'm saying <1> That's bad. Perhaps you should talk to the landlord, or maybe call the police next time he's loud. <0> i am trying to be nice. But if it persists i'll have to call the police <1> I understand. Sure seems like you've been very tolerant. I feel for you and agree about calling the police. <0> really,its exhausting <1> So sorry for you. You will need to do something, not fair to you to go on. <0> yeah. Thank you really.
<0> I really pray my Christmas bonus comes in this year. <1> is there a chance you wont? <0> I'm not sure. Sometimes the cafe that I work at is unreliable. <1> That isn't cool. I hope you get your bonus this year. Ill keep my fingers crossed for you. <0> Thank you! If it does then I am going to buy my cat a new structure to play on. Do you like cats <1> I have two cats. They are crazy, but I love them. What is your cats name? <0> His name is Macho and he has black and white fur. What are your cats names? <1> I have a calico named gypsy who just turned 6 this year and a cat I found as a stray kitten I named Oscar who is also black and white <0> How cute!

He has 6 dogs and 6 cats, it's crazy! <1> That's a lot of animals to take care of!
<0> I expected something good,  that was why things are working well for me now <1> That's great news to hear. I hope things continue to stay great for you. <0> Of course,  it is good not to lose yourself when things are difficult <1> I agree. I think that difficult times are best navigated with a calm mind. <0> Definitely. My therapist says the same thing.

<0> I'm been loosing weight January. I'm down 50 pounds. I have 10 more to go but I'm happy. <1> That is great. How have you done it? <0> I've always walked a lot at work. I average 10 miles a day so kept doing that but I cut out all processed food and drinks.  <1> That is a lot of walking. I can hardly walk 1 mile. <0> It is a lot of walking.
<0> I went for a run last month and the most unexpected thing happened to me. <1> Oh yes? What happened?
<0> i'm usually pretty busy , i'm a accountant . . freelance , no particular company <1> i'm a vet tech . its fun . <0> Do you get to play with a lot of animals? <1> I do, it is a lot of fun. I even have a parakeet. <0> Oooo a pet bird. Reminds me back when I had a bird. <1> What kind of bird was it? <0> It was a parrot. But that was ages ago. Feels like i have lived a few lifetimes.  <1> Yeah me too, what kinfd of accounting do you do? <0> Ironically I work for a social media marketing company. I say Ironically becasue of the market title, I hate social settings. Kind of unrelated but, eh. <1> I'm not fond of social settings either, but I like going out for dinner. What foods do you eat? <0> I love sushi! I usual order in though and watch a movie or game. 
<0> Niagara Falls are beautiful this time of year. Have you ever been? <1> I have not! My parents have been several times. They enjoy going to the city of Niagra Falls in Ontario, Canada! <0> Wonderful. Many couples get engaged while visiting the Niagara Falls. It is such a romantic spot! <1> That would make sense, as the smallest of the 3 falls is called Bridal Veil Falls! <0> Wow, I did not know that was an actual name. I wonder how many proposals have happened there! <1> I am not sure. There are several Bridal Veil falls throughout the USA though. I know of one in WA state, and one in Oregon. You can actually go to the Bridal Veil ghost town in Oregon and get your wedding invitations stamped! <0> That is so interesting. Your knowledge is definitely encyclopedic. I would love to visit a real ghost town one day. <1> I live near Bridal Veil Falls, Oregon, that's how I know it exists. Ghost towns do a great job of preserving period-specific artifacts, specifically architecture. They are a huge tourist attraction!  <0> I wonder if some people may look for real ghosts in these towns!
<0> I walked into the bathroom to see my brother smiling and my fish bowl empty. <1> Hahahaha funny though. Did he have something to do with it? <0> he is visiting, he does not live with me. <1> Wow! At least he does not get to do that a lot.  <0> yes, we were discussing cooking fish...and then.... <1> Oh wow. So sorry about your fish.  <0> i can cook fish along with several other cuisines...but NOT from our fish bowl! sheesh! <1> I'm not a great cook. <0> I love to cook...italian and sea foods are my favorite :) <1> Awesome. I love sea food too!  <0> shrimp and pasta is good...seafood with italian...:) <1> Shrimp is the best. Especially with italian.
<0> that happens , but being content with what love they had left for you is good ? <1> i suppose . its why i am in therapy . depression is real . <0> It's difficult to cope with. <1> Yeah, it is some days are good but not all. sigh <0> It really helps to have a job you love, my mother was a teacher and even when she felt down she was happy to always teach. <1> That true. school just ways down on the mind to get the dream job. <0> My dream job has always been to be a nascar driver. The first car I drove was a stickshift, my parents were able to teach me. <1> That seem nice but I don't know to drove a stick-shift. <0> It is not too difficult! you can always learn! <1> Well I'm a very positive and optimistic person so learning should be easy for me!
<0> Is 7 considered lucky? <1> 7? as in the number between 6 and 8? <0> Correct.     A lot of people are superstitious about numbers. <1> I'm not a superstitious person myself, meaning I don't really believe in magic, or even have much for religious beliefs. <0> That is fine, but many people are.     I like clovers myself. <1> Clovers are really cool, a gorup of clovers are called a cluff!
<0> i am in the canadian army . where do you live ? <1> i live in charlotte , north carolina . <0> nice . what do you do for work ? <1> i work at the bank of america . i like the work . <0> i am active duty right now . <1> oh cool . do you have any kids at home ? <0> no , i'm going to get married next year and then we may try . <1> so you are engaged to be married ? <0> yes . we are getting married next september . <1> sweet . is it going to be a big marriage ?
<0> yes , that is a good one ! do you like old comedies ? <1> some , i like old movies more . and art film . i want to be a curator . <0> That is a great career I would love to be a yoga instructor someday. Do you do yoga. <1> I've never tried it but considered it. It seems a little intimidating  <0> No not really it is so relaxing and gives you a piece of mind you should try it. What hobbies do you like? <1> I like going to rock shows, meditation, spending time with my children, drawing <0> I never been to a rock show sounds interesting. My wife works as a mechanic so we don't go out much. <1> She's a mechanic? That's awesome!  <0> Yes she's actually a diesel mechanic lot's of people are surprised when I tell them my wife's career lol. <1> I think it is fabulous! I think more women in that career could definitely do good things for the industry  <0> I like your way of thinking I appreciate the change in life now with women and men being equal.  <1> They always should be! There isn't any reason for a woman who cares about what she is doing not to do it.  <0> I tend to disagree because I think men will always be superior to women.
<0> I am so scared of clowns. What can you tell me about them? <1> Well, they're just comic performers who use slapstick comedy. Not really much to be afraid of to be honest. <0> Maybe it is the movie It that caused my fears. <1> There are various traditions in costume and performance for clowns. I guess you're talking about the Stephen King movie, It? <0> That is correct. Pennywise looks so creepy. I know it's just a movie but I'm afraid there is a real killer clown. <1> Well, yeah there actually were a bunch of clown sightings in 2016, but I think it was just people messing around. <0> I hope so. I would get nightmares if I saw one like Pennywise.
<0> My favorite color is red, it's also a primary color in the RGB color model? <1> yes the three primary colors are yellow, red, and blue, blue is my favorite <0> The name of the color model RGB derives from the primary colors being used Red, Green, and Blue <1> yes and all three colors can be combined to make all the colors of the rainbow, this makes sense as when you are looking at something 93% of the time we judge its appearence and how colors appeal to us <0> Yes, colors are a main part of how we judge the emotion of things as well. The Egyptians and Mayans also coloured their faces red in ceremonies. Even Roman generals had their bodies colored red to celebrate victory <1> red is just a very vibrant color, ads with colors are read 42% more than black and white ads
<0> hi what do you do ? <1> i go to school . hate it ! will you be my friend ? <0> sure ! you can be friends with my 3 dogs too if you aren't allergic <1> oh , i am not ! i am only 12 , though . will they like me ? <0> i think they will . all of them are friendly ! whats your favorite subject ? <1> i do not like school at all . and gym is the worst ! <0> i'm always walking my dogs so gym activities are fun for me <1> the boys pull my waist length red hair . that hurts !
<0> I was looking through my cloud and found some pics of when I was little. <1>  A walk down memory lane. <0> Yeah,  it makes me miss being at home and around my family. <1> Oh I bet! It's always good to cherish those memories. <0> Not really, I don’t really care to think about them and reminisce.
<0> I had a great time hiking with my family and dog recently! Do you like nature? <1> I do.  It feels great to get out into nature doesn't it? <0> Yeah I always enjoy hiking in the mountains or just going to the beach. <1> The beach is my most favorite place to go. <0> It has been too long since I have been to the beach.
<0> true . same could be said for pop i guess . you are right ! <1> yes lol i like pop an some songs off the chains <0> What do you mean by off the chains? <1> Just crazy songs in general I think! Like rock, pop, and hip pop <0> Huh! Ive never been too big of a fan of those genres but they arent bad! <1> Sometimes you have to be in the mood, but overall I love those genres <0> My favorite is Jazz and classical piano.

<0> So i just bought a brand new corvette and I let my friend barrow it to go out of town.  <1> That's awesome! Hopefully it comes back in one piece. <0> I agree! She will take care of it. I have faith she will bring it back the way she got it! lol <1> I think it will be fine. I bet the new car runs well. <0> I do agree, it runs great! She will bring it back in great shape.

My whole family drives Chevies. <1> I like Fords, as long as they're blue. That's my favorite color <0> If I showed up at a family gathering with a Ford, they'd throw me out.
<0> I am ready for my law exam <1> The big one? The bar? That's a whole lot of schooling and effort culminating in to one test! I imagine you're very excited,  but anxious too.
<0> I do.  The organization does a lot of good work.  From protecting animals from harm, to promoting responsible pet ownership <1> Promoting responsible pet ownership is so important. As well as reducing the number of homeless pets. <0> Yeah i love pets <1> Me too.  They really are a man or womans best friend.  Do you have dogs?
<0> The only piercings I have are a single piercing in both of my ears. How about you? <1> I have three ear piercing - one in one ear, two in the other. <0> That's cool. Do you have any tattoos?  <1> I do not have any tattoos and don't really plan on getting one ever. Do you have any? <0> No I don't but I have been thinking about getting one. Do you smoke?  <1> Smoking is quite bad for you so I prefer not to. <0> That's great! I used to smoke but I don't anymore. Do you have any bad habits that you're trying to quit?  <1> Mainly just the bad aspects of my diet. I also play way too much nintendo and may need to ease up on that. <0> I hear you. I love video games! I currently have 10 piercings total but no plans to get anymore. Do you plan to get anymore piercings?  <1> We have already discussed piercings.
<0> That's cool. I have never played high school football, but I have gone to a few games. <1> There is so much to enjoy at the games,pep rallies, marching bands and mascots! What was your favourite thing? <0> I always liked the fans that dressed up crazy. <1> I would always root for my own high school team and go to pep rallies and the homecoming game. <0> I met my wife at a high school football game. Now we have been together for 21 years. <1> Wow. That's a long time. Congrats!
<0> One time I looked at the mirror and thought I saw a monster <1> Whoa! That is really scary! I've felt weird sensations like that before.
<0> That is great for your health I'm sure!  Do you enjoy being out in nature while you are walking? <1> I do, but it raises different problems than that in water, I get tired very easily! <0> I love walking in nature. I wish I had more time to devote to doing it. <1> It is hard to motivate myself if it wasn't for the scenery probably. <0> I love walking in the Autumn it is so crisp and beautiful. You also meet lots of interesting people.  <1> yep nature is pretty awesome . the complexity of everything can humble a person . <0> I try to walk ten thousand steps each day. I have a little bit of weight to lose.  <1> Ten thousand steps a day is my goal also.  Have you tried any other lifestyle changes for managing your weight? <0> I have been cutting out sweets and concentrating on eating protein.  <1> Sounds like a plan! You can also try to see if there is less calorie version of foods you like. <0> Yes, but I am trying to keep to eating natural foods. As long is the food is not processed I'm all for it.  <1> Organic helps me a lot as well but unfortunately most things that are gluten free are NOT organic and I am so sensitive to pesticides
<0> are you as fired up about winter coming as i'm ? <1> winter is very lonely though <0> if you are lonely get a cat . i have two of those . <1> cats are good but unsure if my bees would like <0> i've a huge hat collection including a beekeeper hat for cats . <1> great what is your favorite type of hat <0> my favorite are baseball hats . i've at least six hundred of those . <1> quite the collector my wife has as many heels <0> back in 1992 i collected a hat from every olympic team . <1> love the games we root for italy <0> italy is awesome . the best vanilla ice cream i ever tasted was from italy . <1> vanilla is a favorite , real gelato is my weakness <0> do you like sports ? i had an athletic career a long time ago . <1> i loved tennis in my younger days <0> do you remember the 1992 olympic womens doubles match ? <1> I love winter and getting out and participating in activities with friends.
<0> Yesterday, I saw my best friend in the park. He was with my ex. <1> That's weird. Are they friends? <0> They were acquaintances, but I guess they are more now. <1> Is that u want to get back? <0> No, she can have him. <1> Cool Guy! <0> Yeah, definitely. I prefer the simple times. <1> Worthless to get back!, if you follow her <0> Yep, I think I'd rather stay home and watch the flinstones. <1> Lol!, u will get a better thing in it! <0> Yeah
<0> I have been alone for almost 5 years now.  <1> As in living alone or single? <0> living alone <1> Do you like living alone or would you like a roommate? <0> I like living alone is quiet  <1> It's never quiet around my house.

So how has your diet been going? The doctor told me I need to get more iron.. ugh! <1> Spinach, man.  I hate the mushy cooked stuff, but I could eat it all day in salads.  Try it raw. <0> Really? I do like it raw, but I agree with you on eating it cooked! Yuck!! <1> My husband loves liver, but it grosses me out, but I hear it has a lot of iron too <0> Yeah I don't think I could handle eating that even for the extra iron! I love eating kale wonder if that has iron do you know? <1> I don't.  I just know that it's better to get the iron from food than from a supplement <0> That is I thought too. I think I will make an appointment with a nutritionist, can't hurt what do you think?  <1> Yeah, that's a good idea.  I met with one when I got diagnosed as diabetic, and it was really helpful
<0> cool , i like movies and their soundtracks . i am actually in a band . <1> what music do yo all play <0> Punky grungy stuff. <1> Nice, but I have never been into that type of music. To each his own, enjoy. <0> I also like anything from a good singer/songwriter. You know? <1> Yes, so do I. I am a medical student and music helps relieve the stress.
<0> We recently celebrated my son's birthday,  and had a big party. <1> oh yeah that must have been a good time <0> It was! He got a lot of cool toys,  and ate a bunch of ice cream. <1> Those are the best times when they still like to play with toy's mine lost interest years ago and I miss it <0> Yeah, it's hard when they get older and lose interest in things
<0> My wife held a surprise birthday party for me. It was totally unexpected and I was shocked when I came home and so many people were there. <1> That's awesome,  I bet you were overjoyed with it!
<0> Wow, no I haven't but that sounds amazing! I drive an old Toyota. Do you like driving it?  <1> Yes it's a blast driving this top-of-the-line Mercedes, which was first introduced in 1972. It's a very powerful car.  <0> Oh, are you rich? <1> I try not to stretch myselft too thin.  Far from rich <0> But you enjoy the finer things in life?  I also have a mercedes as well as a toyota <1> Wow, how much does your car insurance for the mercedes cost?
<0> I love taking my wife to the bakery.  That's the place where a baker works. <1> When did humans discover the art of baking? <0> Boy grains have been around as a staple food for millenia.  Baking those grains is really rather old. <1> Which country did  baking originate from? <0> Well we know that there were enclosed ovens used by the greeks in the fifth and sixth century BC. <1> Give me a dummy's definition for bakery <0> Bakers will make bread using an oven, or any heat source to bake bread. <1> Ok what does one need in order to bake

<0> all kinds . mostly reptiles , but i have trained 30 animals in my career <1> cool , since you train animals do you still eat meat ? <0> I still do eat meat, I try to not eat as much but I need to make sure me and my family get the appropriate nutrition. <1> My daughter is thinking about that career track.  Is it hard though when an animal doesn't make it? <0> You just have to be able to adjust your training regime and look back at what went wrong and how you can improve. <1> Do you train any monkeys? <0> No, while I do some exotic animals, monkeys are not really in my wheel house! My wife does the more unusual animals for us. <1> Whats your favorite animal to train?
<0> I think that chestnut brown is a beautiful color of hair, but most women tend to dye their hair when it's brown. Do you think natural brown hair is pretty? <1> I think its beautiful, they dye it i think because its the second most common hair color <0> Would you consider dying your hair a crazy color for a month if you knew you could get it back to its original color at the end of the month? <1> Then yes :D , but i would do it at home, not at the hairdressers i would be ashamed :D <0> What color would you choose and why? Would you hide the color from others when going out for that month, or would you embrace the change and see what happened <1> Well i would probably not make it for a month and hide all the time, and after few days give a tip to my hairdresser to come and fix the change :D <0> Hahaha. I think I would love to have a neon color head of hair, but I think I would have to have an excuse for dying it. My friends and family would think I had gone crazy if I just did it for no reason, but I actually think it would be quite fun to do. <1> hehe the reason why for me i would say that i did it because i want to be like Lucifer from Supernatural drama, if you have seen it
<0> here was a giant spider in my house the other day. I was terrified <1> Oh my, how did you deal with it? I hope you didnt kill it. <0> I caught it in a jar and put it out side  <1> Thats good, I like to keep the less scary looking spider around. Keeps my house clear of other bugs <0> Oh I know but this one was huge and had the longest legs on it  <1> Yea, that is definitely an outside spider! <0> my cat was playing with it <1> Haha cats are so fun to watch catch bugs, just got to be careful to not let them eat too many <0> they were chasing the leaves this morning when the wind was blowing  <1> Cats never let you have a dull moment <0> I wish cats hunted spiders and kept them out of the house.
<0> me too , but mostly i play jazz , usually bass . what did you make ? <1> i made a jewelry box as a gift for my sisters birthday next month . she will be 35 . <0> Wow, I am also going to turn 35 this year! <1> Happy birthday!  Are you doing anything fun for your birthday?
<0> I was packing up my house to move,  and found my old yearbooks! It's so weird to look back and see how far everyone I knew in high school has come. <1> Aww,  that sounds interesting!  Are you in touch with many people from high school?
<0> I think it would be a huge impact on our society just to find unicellular life <1> yes, that is true, and if much more advance life existed why haven't we hear more from them if they are capable of interstellar travel <0> It could be that they are afraid of us. <1> Or they have visited and the government is just covering it up.  <0> Or they visited, saw what our government is like, and turned right around and went back home. Lol. <1> Hahaha! You're probably not wrong about that!  <0> I'm not sure I would ever want to participate in space travel if it ever became an option to the general public. <1> I agree. Who would even have the money for that? <0> I would definitely come up with the money if it meant going into space.
<0> our lord and saviour will help us! he will guide us all to paradise, i have faith ! <1> wow thats very faithful of you <0> Thank you, Don't you think the same? <1> Yes, I do believe that everyone has a purpose.  I once fell up an entire flight of stairs with only a bruise or two, so I definitely have faith <0> Oh, that relatively small injury, Jesus always saves us with the least injury possible  
<0> I have.  I actually have played for a couple of seasons.  I normally use ESPN for my fantasy leagues <1> Cool, the players choose rosters during a draft at the beginning of the season where all NFL players are chosen. <0> these days i mostly play for fun though, not for money <1> I always play for money. I like the thrill of it. <0> I wonder if it'll ever get legislated as a type of gambling or betting. <1> I don't know. I assumed it was considered a legal form of gamblng already. What a coincidence that we both play. <0> There are actually surprisingly few regulations on it. I certainly wouldn't want to be involved with writing those laws though. <1> It feels so much like a fun game that I never really thought much about the regulations tbh. <0> I guess it's just a side effect of working in law. I even think about those user agreements before clicking accept <1> Ah, I see. I just do it because I can't get enough football, whether it's real or fantasy.  <0> Do you also play video games? <1> Not much these days. I started doing martial arts with my son and it takes up most of my "free" time.
<0> When I am stressed, I overeat. Last night I ate a whole pizza by mself! <1> I'm sorry! Sounds like you might struggle with overeating. Basically meaning that you eat an excess of food in relation to what you need. <0> Right! Are there any good ways to combat this weakness? <1> Yes! They actually have a few types of therapy that can help like group therapy, cognitive behavioural therapy, and individual therapy. <0> That sounds like what I need! I also think it would be great if there were some natural remedies. <1> It's nothing to be ashmaed of, everyone deals with stress in diffrent ways. I suffered from Anorexia for a long time. They have a group called overeaters anonymous you could try :)

<0> I love going to the bakery and seeing the baker cook stuff. Do you know any cool stuff about bakers?  <1> Grains have been a staple food for millennia, baking is a very old one!  <0> Thats neat, I bet that baking has a very long heritage, Did people in the stone age know how to bake food?  <1> I don't think they did, but by the 5th and 6th centuries the ancient Greeks were using ovens. Most communities had one large shared oven. <0> wow the greeks had ovens? thats really cool. What kind of ovens did they use? Was it coal or fire?  <1> These enclosed ovens were heated by wood fires that were mainly for different types of bread. <0> Oh alright, That makes sense, since wood is easily available and I dont think greeks knew what coals were back then. What else do you know about bakers?  <1> In ancient Rome a few centuries later the first mass production of bread started. They say being a professional baker started then. <0> yes. it takes a skill
<0> I took my neice to volunteer at a homeless shelter this past weekend. She showed alot of compassion and love for the homless and needy.  <1> That's really thoughtful of you. Do you typically do things like that? <0> Well I volunteer to help abused and battered kids. I wanted to show her things like this. I know she can be a good loving person. 
<0> I recently decided to start blogging again and feel pretty good about it. I used to have a decent sized audience, so hopefully I can build it back up. <1> I'm sure if you can let people know that you're back blogging, they'd come back to see what you're up to now!  What do you blog about? <0> i like to play tennis <1> Cool! That's a good workout. How long have you been playing? <0> two years <1> And is that what you blog about? <0> yes <1> I've been playing a lot of squash to get in shape.

Not the best but pays the bills!
<0> I Have never seen it, what is it about? <1> It's based on the actual story of the Zodiac Killer. The main character tries to find the vicious psychopath. <0> That sounds to scary for me, I can't deal with serial killer stuff <1> It's a little scary sometimes but i like to see the reality of which we live <0> That is true, you should shield yourself from everything bad out there <1> I guess. What do you like to do <0> I usually like to watch documentaries, its really easy to get lost in all the information. <1> Yeah it is lol i think some are boring thiugh <0> Oh some definitely are, Just have to find the right topic of where your interests are. <1> true. what topics do you like most <0> I usually go for war, sports, and the occasional one about a company
<0> Do you know anything about dairy farming? <1> I know a lot actually, dairy farming class of agriculture for long-term production of milk. <0> That sounds interesting! I always wondered how butter was made and why humans drink another animals milk! <1> Yeah its kinda odd if you really think about it. and other species that commercially make milk are goats, sheep and camels. <0> Oh yeah I forgot about all those, I suppose they would be present on a dairy farm as well! Ive used lotion made from goat milk! and goat cheese is gross tasting <1> Dairy is really fascinating. 
<0> I like to color my hair to cover gray, do you color your hair? <1> Don't tell anyone, but yes, I do!  LOL  I usually get it done professionally by a hairdresser <0> Oh that is good I have made a few mistakes doing my own lol <1> Me too!  I always made such a mess!  Interestingly, there were  $1.9 billion in sales of at home coloring in the U.S. 2011! <0> I believe it hair coloring is expensive, especially the Loreal brand <1> It sure is!  I'd rather get it done at the hair dresser whenever I want to change to a color regarded as more fashionable  <0> I live in a rural area and there are not that many experienced colorists so I do my own <1> Just be careful, if you spill it, it makes a big mess!  And I never realized until recently that 75% of women in Copenhagen have used hair dye!
<0> Do you enjoy a good wine tasting. I find I meet the most interesting people at them. <1> Oh that is the sensory evaluation of wine, I enjoy it a bit <0> My local Vineyard had a pairing last weekend with cupcakes. O' my it was awesome. <1> You know the practice of wine tasting is as old as the practice of wine making <0> I'd imagine you have to taste it when you make it. <1> Around 14th century a more formalized method became established
<0> Hello! I recently read an article about medical marijuana now being allowed in the united kingdom,  What do you think about it? <1> I think that is wonderful,  it's about time more countries and states are making this medicine an option. <0> the way it ended up being legalized,  IMO,  was a complete disgrace,  they confiscated some childs weed who was epileptic,  and as a result - predictably - he immediately started having seizured without it. Like gee,  well done on torturing the kid! Do you think it was right to confiscate it,  even though it technically wasnt legal at the time? <1> No,  but as Mark Twain once said,  the law is an ass. 
<0> im nervous about an interview next week <1> Who is the interview with?
<0> My co-worker makes almost double the amount I do and yet does about half the work... <1> That is so messed up. <0> Its probably because he is a man <1> Have you talked to management about it? maybe they are unaware <0> No, I just feel like they would not take it seriously <1> You should try, or bring it up to HR. At least bring it to light so others see what is going on <0> Maybe I should see if it is the same with all my coworkers first, then if it is, I won't have to talk to HR alone about it.  <1> That might be a good idea. Unless he's been there more than twice as long and recieved that many more raises it isn't fair.  <0> Yeah I guess you have a point there. I will make sure I talk to someone about it by the end of the week.  <1> maybe you will uncover something big. If more men are making double than women, it may show pattern and you can get something done about it <0> I just hope that I would not be causing any problems if that is true.  <1> Well if its true, you wouldnt be causing a problem, you would be bringing an injustice to light <0> yeah, i'd like that
<0> The other day I was listening to Spotify and put U2's Achtung Baby on. It reminds me of pre middle school days. <1> I used to love that band

<0> I love the color red which is at the end of the visible light spectrum. It is next to orange and opposite of violet. <1> It is a very symbolic color, for sure! <0> Yes! The Mayans and Ancient Egyptians colored their faces red for ceremonies. Roman generals also colored their bodies red to celebrate if they had a victory. <1> That makes sense! It is the color of blood after all. I think purple had a lot of symbolism back then too didn't it? <0> Definitely! Purple is associated with royalty, mystery, piety and mystery. <1> Very cool.

<0> So my 1 year review at work is coming up and I feel its going to be good since I wokred so hard.  <1> Hard work pays off in the long-run. If your work is truly authentic in its nature,  it is definitely going to be recognized and appreciated <0> I agree. I think my raise will be good as well as the promotion I asked for.  <1> Be careful while negotiating your pay raise. Some managers may find it too intrusive and that may leave bad impression on them <0> It's okay, I worked hard so I know I deserve the raise and promotion.

Good for your friend to have worked there <1> Wow I did not know such an organization existed. What functions do they serve or help with with bread? <0> They represent different style of bakery. By the way, are you aware of Nordic bread culture at all? <1> Oh gotcha. No I am not familiar but that sound interesting. What style is Nordic bread culture? <0> The originate in Scandinavian countries and only four grain types dominate the styles <1> Interesting. What are the four grain types if you don't mind telling me? I will have to tell my Mom about this as she is a bread lover. <0> The two oldest ones are barley and rye, ant two more recent and wheat and oats. Overall, Nordic bread culture is considered to be pre-historic <1> That is fascinating, I had no idea about bread history.

<0> I lent my car to my 17-year-old sister today. She left at 10 in the morning and it's midnight, and she still isn't back with it. I trust her mostly, but she hasn't been driving for long, and it makes me nervous thinking of her out there on the road <1> Did you call her?

<0> As the day was coming to an end,  I was begging to believe that my solitude was perfect.   <1> Well in some ways solitude is nice. <0> Yes if you take it in portions.  <1> True everything is nice in bits. Too much of anything does get tiring. <0> I agree, moderation is necessary, even for the good things.
<0> One day my girlfriend told me about a guy that works with her and she mentioned how hilarious he was which then made me think of a meme that i read about how funny guys will make you laugh and then all of a sudden you don't have clothes on. It was only for a split second but it happened <1> That is a hilarious intro,  thank you for that! So were you worried that your girlfriend found someone else humorous? (And you're very insightful + intelligent if you say yes! Though being both of those things,  you have nothing to worry about ;-)) <0> Well,  I most def want to be insightful and intelligent,  so I will say YES. I know I had nothing to worry about,  but it is crazy how in those instances when you least expect it a ridiculous meme shots into your brain and you start playing "Along Came Polly" sceneros in your head.  <1> These references are perfect. And your girlfriend must enjoy you very much. Mazel tov,  you crazy kids! <0> Thank you
<0> i do as well . i also like fashion a lot . <1> i currently have alot of kids <0> How many kids do you have? <1> 2- but that is a lot, trust me. <0> I wouldn't know, I don't have any kids.  Do you have time for yourself with 2 kids? <1> Not really. I used to follow my favorite band's tour, but not anymore. :(
<0> I like Target. It's the second-largest discount store retailer in the United States <1> Yes, I like shopping there too. They have some different items than other similar stores. <0> Yeah, they have interesting things in their stores. They have found success as a cheap-chic player in the industry. <1> Yes, they definitely have found a niche in the market. I wished they were in some of the smaller cities though. <0> Me too. I grew up in a small town and always had to travel to another city to visit Target. The first store actually opened in the small town of Roseville, Minnesota in 1962 <1> For some reason, I thought they had been around longer. But, that's still a long time. <0> The company that owns it was originally named Goodfellow Dry Goods and opened in 1902 <1> Oh, I see. So, they evolved from a former business then?
<0> I'm really scared to go back to school. <1> Oh no!  What has you scared? <0> It's all new to me,  I've never done it before <1> It'll be okay I promise.  First few days will be weird but you'll slip in no problem once you adjust to your schedule. <0> Thanks for the advice.
<0> I like the color red. Its at the end of the visible light spectrum. <1> Red is a great color.   <0> Also red has a dominant wavelength measured at approximately 625-740 nanometres.  <1> Interesting.  Rubies are pretty too. <0> Yes, they are. In prehistoric art, red was one of the first colors that was used.
<0> I had an eye surgery recently now I am anxiously waiting for perfect vision. <1> ive always wanted to have the eye surgery. im ready to get rid of my glasses and contacts
<0> I was really scared about the possibility of losing my cat to a bad illness, but I was lucky that the vet worked hard to find out what was wrong. <1> Oh wow, I'm glad the vet was able to do that. It must have been scary.  <0> It was, but he's on the mend now. <1> That is great to hear. I am so happy he is ok! <0> Do you have any pets? <1> I have an outside cat. I actually just finished feeding her some treats. <0> Cats are great, I don't think I would have the time to look after a dog. <1> I want a dog one day. Do you have any other cats? <0> Nah, just the one. I spend to much time out of the house to have any more. <1> I would have 100 indoor cats if it were not for the smell  <0> At what point would you stop being able to remember their names? <1> I never thought of that but that is a great point. 
<0> What ages represent an elementary school? <1> In the United States, for example, elementary students are usually between 6 to 12, but sometimes 6 to 10 and 6 to 14. <0> That's interesting. In my school district, 14-year-olds would be in high school. I do like the idea of having a broader mixture of ages, though. <1> I remember school details here cause it was when I got my start playing football. I play now for the Philadelphia Eagles, my second season. <0> Woah. Really? I grew up outside Philadelphia, in Cherry Hill, so you guys are still my home team! <1> Wow, small world! Yeah, last season I did not get a whole lot of playing time but now it's getting better. <0> Have you been with the team long? Where did you play college ball? <1> I went to college at Wake Forest. I'm excited to finally be getting more playing time and starting my career! <0> So what's it like playing on a professional team?  <1> It has its ups and downs like most things, but it's really rewarding to connect with fans and having them recognize you wherever you go. <0> Nice,although sometimes a certain age in school is best,having a mix can complicate things.

So glad I wear contacts for that very reason. <1> i am livid...i have contact lenses. but i love my glasses <0> Have you ever considered lasix?  Everyone says it's worth getting done. <1> Yeah I've considered that, I might do it  <0> Same here.  I could do without having to put contacts in every morning. <1> Yeah and I've heard is a really quick procedure these days, and quite painless

When did people start coding? <0> Some people learn it from trade school or college.
<0> I love jazz music but I don't know much about it .Call you tell me more? <1> Jazz is a musical genre <0> I know it is,more descriptive pls <1> Jazz is seen by many as American Classics <0> Don't understand! When was the first jazz music record? <1> Jazz started since 1920 <0> WNO was the first jazz artist ever recorded? <1> Jazz has west african roots and musical expresions
<0> I work for a railroad company as a train conductor. <1> That sounds fun! You're responsible for the duties that involve the train operation?  <0> Yep! I make sure that the train runs on schedule and I also direct the train's movement. <1> The name "conductor" is most used in North America. People in other areas of the world have other names for it. Do you ever work internationally?  <0> Unfortunately, I don't work internationally, but I have been on trains when I visited other countries. What other names do they have for a conductor? <1> In Commonwealth English they use the title "guard" or "train manager". Weird right? <0> That's so strange! Conductor sounds much cooler. I can understand "manager" but "guard" is a little strange. <1> Yea, other countries have cooler names, I agree. 
<0> I like to shop at Target. It's actually the second largest discount store in the US, next to Walmart. <1> I also love Target, they are so clean inside. <0> Yes, and items are a bit different. It used to be named Goodfellow Dry Goods back in 1902 when it was first opened, and went through a few more names until 1910 <1> So it officially became Target in 1910? <0> Well, the actual first Target opened in Minnesota in 1962, but the parent company was renamed Dayton Corporation in 1967. It's been a process! <1> How many Target stores are there in the USA?

<0> It was only 2 years ago that I started hitting gym to pursue physical fitness in my lifestyle <1> That's incredible, its important to stay in shape, I work out and maintain a Ketogenic diet for the sake of my wellbeing. <0> I only got Whey protein powder for beginning and planned a diet that consisted only of products rich in protein <1> Honestly, whey protein is unnecessary unless you are a top level athelete, MCT oil and natural proteins are much more bioavailable for energy <0> I didn't know that. Nevertheless, thanks to Whey, I gained 6.6 pounds of muscle mass <1> That's a good job.  Whey will do that.
<0> i anticipate my future,  if i continue to work always and chase after my dreams i will climb that mountain   <1> Yeah that is a pretty good mindset to go by.
<0> Hi, I love eating pasta,  a staple food of traditional Italian cuisine <1> Wow who discovered pasta? <0> Cavatelli of Italy is known for making pasta-like dishes depending on region and town.  <1> Sweet.

Dr. Dre's production was always amazing. <1> Yeah, nothing really beats that early stuff from Dre, The Chronic and CHronic 2001 are my favorites <0> No doubt. As far as East Coast, "Illmatic" by Nas is my favorite album ever. That was what really got me into old school rap <1> Yeah, that was very good as well, I was a big fan of It Was Written too
<0> I have a friend who is struggling maintaining her sobriety. She says it's tough to achieve a life balance. <1> Struggling with addiction is so hard you're a good person for listening to her. Is it drugs or alcohol? <0> Thank you. It's alcohol. She spent some time in a treatment setting to get started on the path to sobriety, but now that she's out, she's having a tough time. <1> Let her know you'll be there for her during thoughts of relapse. Is she attending AA classes? I know those help a lot. <0> She isn't, but I'll definitely pass on the suggestion! She said the first physical effects of withdrawal were tough, but the second stage, PAWS, might be worse! <1> Can you tell me what PAWS means? Hopefully she has an AA sponsor! <0> PAWS stands for post acute withdrawal syndrome. During this stage recovering addicts usually experience emotional and psychological symptoms. It's due to their brain trying to regain normal function.  <1> That's sounds unbelievably hard to deal with! The fact you know this means you care a lot for your friend! Thank you for sharing! <0> Thanks for listening! I think when something takes over your subconscious and tries to get you to fail, abstaining is incredibly difficult! I'm hoping this stage passes quickly for her! <1> I hope so too. Your friend is lucky that she has someone like you beside her.

Are you located in the USA? <1> yes, and the buddy is made by genuine
<0> I just dyed my hair blonde this afternoon. Do you like blondes? <1> Hair dying is the practice of changing hair color to look good <0> Well, they do say blondes have more fun like in the movie Legally Blonde. <1> Apparently the original Legally Blonde was a musical based on a book by Heather Hach <0> I love the movie, but I hate musicals. What's your favorite musical? <1> My favorite musical might be Grease. Great film that also includes a lot of hair dye and coloring. <0> Who's the main character in Grease?

<0> I really love red the colour, it exists at the end of the visible spectrum of light! <1> red seems like such a bold color <0> It is very bold, it is the manifestation of electromagnetic radiation with the range of wavelengths or simply called light. <1> Are there variations of red? <0> Red ranges from brilliant yellow-tinged scarlet, to the vermillion color all the way to bluish-red crimson, and varies in all kinds of shade. <1> have scientists found out how the color red can affect emotions? <0> Not entirely but we do know it is almost primordial, red pigment made from ochre was one of the first colors used in prehistoric art. It moves our very essence. <1> Wow, the color red sounds like it must be one of the greatest colors then!

I only dress nice when I go to the symphony orchestra. Where do you like to go for fun? <1> I am a bit of a home body. Don't enjoy getting out. <0> i have been a home body this week due to the weather. Is it cold where you are? <1> Not cold; just WET. We have had torrential rains.

I used to listen to a lot of Kenny G back in the day.  I believe I even had his album Duotones <0> That was one of his better works - I also really got into Cand Dulfer <1> Can you believe that Candy Dulfer began playing at the age of six? <0> I did not know that - she sure can play some cool music <1> Yes, her band 'Funky Stuff' she created just when she was 14 years old.  Quite a musical prodegy
<0> I watched Wimbledon for the first time. Those tennis players are so good! <1> I watched it too! My favorite is Federer. Who is yours? <0> I like watching Serena Williams. Do you watch every summer? <1> I have for the past 10 years! It's one of my favorite sports to watch. <0> I have been watching it for about 10 years now too.
<0> I am angry because I didn't get served when it was my turn <1> What were you expected to be served? <0> at 7:00 and now its 9:00, the person who was serve had an "emergency" <1> I hate when that happens. Life is so unfair. <0> It is! but lately I've been trying to roll with the punches but it's just to hard sometimes. <1> It is. Have you tried yoga and meditation? <0> no but i always wanted to. is it really worth it? <1> I think so. It helps me relax after a hard day at school. <0> maybe i will have to try it. just afraid that it will be wasting my time if it i don't see results. <1> The stress needs to go. Everything is temporary! What do you do for fun? <0> very true, and is work considered "fun"? haha
<0> What ages represent an elementary school? <1> In the United States, for example, elementary students are usually between 6 to 12, but sometimes 6 to 10 and 6 to 14. <0> That's interesting. In my school district, 14-year-olds would be in high school. I do like the idea of having a broader mixture of ages, though. <1> I remember school details here cause it was when I got my start playing football. I play now for the Philadelphia Eagles, my second season. <0> Woah. Really? I grew up outside Philadelphia, in Cherry Hill, so you guys are still my home team! <1> Wow, small world! Yeah, last season I did not get a whole lot of playing time but now it's getting better. <0> Have you been with the team long? Where did you play college ball? <1> I went to college at Wake Forest. I'm excited to finally be getting more playing time and starting my career! <0> So what's it like playing on a professional team? 
<0> Someone broke into our new home, I couldn't believe it. <1> Oh man that is so scary. Did they steal anything? <0> Yeah, they stole both of my laptops <1> Oh no. That's scary. Are you ok? <0> Yeah, I think so.  It just is a little disappointing.  I have chocolate to keep me distracted. <1> Chocolate is a good distraction. What kind of chocolate do you have? <0> Hershey's.  It's okay, but I prefer Reese's.  <1> Hershey's are my favorite.
<0> I am looking forward to getting a promotion. I have to hire 3 people. <1> Oh wow more responsibility! I bet the pay raise will be welcome <0> Yes,  a couple more levels and it will be easier. <1> Sweet! Sounds like a good job. How are the bosses? <0> They are ok, but I will be getting last pay.
<0> Found out recently that one of my best friends from back home died in an accident. <1> Oh my gosh! That is horrible! I am so sorry to hear that. <0> Thank you. I don't even have it in me to call her parents and offer my condolences yet,  it's just too shocking. <1> I understand that. Just give it some time and call when you are ready. <0> That's great advice, I'm afraid I won't know what to say when I call them.
<0> I like to bake in my spare time. Do you? <1> Yes i love it! Cooking with dry heat in an oven is awesome. What type of things do you like to make? <0> I have a huge sweet tooth so lots of baked goods (cakes, cookies, etc.) I also like cooking different things like stews and broths <1> I love to make baked bread. It's probably the most common thing people like to make. A classic for sure! You ever eat fresh baked bread? <0> Yup! I actually used to have one of those bread makers too lol. I haven't eaten as much bread as I used to though. It messes with my diet <1> It takes some practice to make. Because the heat slowly is transferred from the outside to the inside, it's hard to tell if they are cooked all the way through sometimes. <0> True. It's the same way with a lot of baked goods as well in that respect  <1> Throughout history baking has been kind of a social role for women, but I'm a guy and love to bake. Oddly enough though it's usually men who bake commercially. Strange isn't it?
<0> math <1> that's cool . i hate math <0> Me too, I like science though. <1> do you like chemistry or biology better <0> Biology, I think animals and mushrooms are really cool. <1> Do you have any pets? <0> No I do not like animals
<0> Jazz is a music genre originated in New Orleans african amaerican community <1> I love jazz! Sinatra and Tony Bennett are my two favorites. Diana Krall is also a good new singer. <0> Yes jazz developed from roots of blues and ragtime <1> Correct! It has deep roots in those genres. I love the trumpet in certain jazz songs. <0> Many say that Jazz is America's classical music <1> Correct! I think so. it was so dominant in America in the 40s and 50s.
<0> My favorite music is rock and roll. <1> Gotta love some Rock and Roll.  It's one of my favorites as well. <0> I like the fact that is a genre of popular music that originated and evolved in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s <1> Indeed it did.  I was speaking to a friend earlier about James Brown and how he influenced so many genres of music starting in the 60's. <0> The "Godfather of Soul". James Brown.  <1> Born in the early 1930's. <0> Besides Rock and Roll, what other kinds of music do you like?
<0> On my way back from a funeral,  my friends and I almost got into a deadly car crash. <1> Oh no,  what happened? <0> I think the other driver was falling asleep on the road. Out of nowhere,  he moved onto the wrong lane directly towards us.
<0> My dog loves dog biscuits I think he is obsessed with them <1> Same my dogs just loves them. but they tend to be hard and dry <0> Oh no there are some that are soft and chewy, made my milk bone <1> Yeah i have heard some may be sold in a flat bone-shape as well <0> I have seen those as well. They even have some softy ones made from duck <1> I read in a magazine thatSome manufacturers claim the dry and hard biscuit texture helps clean the dog's teeth <0> Yeah there are some made specifically for that <1> Have you ever heard of "Dog's bread"? it is made out of bran.
<0> They ran out of my favorite dessert at the restaurant I went to. <1> what did you do? <0> I unfortunately had to choose an alternate which was okay, but not as delicious as the usual. <1> That's always disappointing. You have a certain taste in mind but it's not quite right <0> Well, you know there's nothing like a great warm apple crisp on these cold winter days. <1> Mmmmm,thé glacé as they say in France!
<0> Oh, good!  That's the size that I was looking for!  I wonder if they would make a good pet for a family with children? <1> They have a long muzzle and stand of their toes. <0> oh do they, thats cool! <1> What kind of dog have you been thinking about? <0> A lurcher. <1> What size are they? <0> Medium sized dogs. <1> I have 2 small dogs <0> oh cool, what dogs? <1> a minature poodle and a chuihua mix <0> oh cool! they are cute. <1> Yea they're both awesome. Have you had a dog previously? <0> yes. <1> Do you want a small one like minature or chuihua mix?
<0> Do you happen to know any twins? <1> I have some friends who are fraternal twins - one a boy and one a girl <0> What is the difference between fraternal and identical? <1> Identical twins develop from one zygote, while fraternal develop from two different eggs <0> So I guess then boy/girl twins are always fraternal. <1> That would be correct.  Each egg has its own sperm cell <0> It's very interesting how twins seem to run in certain families - is it hereditary? <1> It seems to be - the yoruba people have the highest rate of twins in the world - 90 to 100 twins per 1000 live births <0> Wow - that is amazing - perhaps it also gives them a way to re-populate faster if there is some other kind of environmental reason <1> I never considered that. That makes a lot of sense. 
<0> i love me some pasta <1> it is very good! Pasta  is a staple food of traditional Italian cuisine <0> when was it created <1> if i recall first reference dating to 1154 in Sicily <0> what can you make with it <1> commonly used to refer to the variety of pasta dishes, pasta is typically a noodle made from an unleavened dough. you can make a lot of differnet pasta

Do you try to eat healthy?
<0> I have to make a cheesecake later. <1> Is it for a special event? <0> Um, it is, I guess. I hope I can finish in time. <1> I love cheesecake, what flavour is it? <0> Chocolate. It is my favorite.  <1> Chocolate cheesecake is the best. Do you make them often? <0> Only for special events.  <1> What kind of event is it? <0> It is a friend's birthday party. There will be so many new people that I do not know there. I am nervous. <1> I bet you will make lots of new friends once they try your cheesecake!  <0> I hope so! <1> Do you like to cook other things? <0> I like to cook meats. <1> Meat is nice, my favorite is chicken which is yours?
<0> i didn't ask my husband if i could buy something,  now he is mad and i feel bad. <1> Aw,  I'm sorry,  did you just forget or you were thinking about other things? <0> I didn't think he would mind.  But it was expensive,  so maybe i should have asked. <1> Yeah,  had a similar scuffle with my wife,  but being married sometimes you just have to forgive and forget. <0> That is true although it isn't always easy.
<0> how do you feel about lesbians ? <1> they're ok some are my friends <0> I think they are better than ok, no different to everyone else. <1> That's what I meant, they are just people, same as everyone else.  What do you do for a living? <0> Exactly. But I work in tv, it takes alot of hard work, talent, experience and connections to be where I am and I'm proud of that. What about you? <1> That's neat!  What do you do in the tv industry?  I work a lot of odd jobs <0> I'm a development producer for science programs for BBC, It's good fun most of the time! But yeah? such as what?  <1> I am a contractor, right now I am putting in walls at the local gay bar.
<0> my brother was sick and he puked in front of me,  it smelled horrible <1> Oh,  yuck! That's gross. Did you get sick too? <0> i didn't,  but no one was home and i had to clean that up :( <1> that's rough! My husband always did with the kids when he was home. <0> Wow, you must have a nice husband.
<0> Do you like Snoop Dogg I think he is overrated  <1> I do like Snoop Dogg. You have to remember that he has been relevant to rap since 1992 when he was discovered by Dr Dre. <0> Yeah he is dad old now in his life <1> Snoop Dogg also has sold over 23 million albums since then. And that is just in the United States alone. <0> O wow I had no idea he was so popular,. <1> I remember I was about 12 when Snoop Dogg's album came out in 1993. That album went platinum 4 times by 1994. <0> What do you think his best song is? <1> I will still say his old school hits like Gin & Juice and What's My Name. They still get played today. <0> I did no know anyone still played his music on the radio. <1> yeah i used to think that too
<0> That's great! Life is a lot less stressful that way. <1> In some societies adults have the highest regrets regarding choices of their education. That is crazy to me. <0> It makes sense, most make a decision at a young age that affects them for a large part of their lives. <1> I believe it is the toughest and most important decision to make. <0> There should be more guidance on the matter of choosing a career. I thought my decision was going to be irreversible.  <1> there are other options in life but you must always follow your heart when making such important decisions. <0> I disagree. Not everyone can be what they wish. Sometimes you have to follow your head, and even that doesn't always work out.  <1> I see your point.  It is a good one! <0> I myself changed the direction of my education multiple times. There were benefits but ultimately it was a mistake.  <1> I believe that.  I also changed directions and it put me behind many years. <0> How long have you changed directions for now?
<0> Yeah, I am always interested in the different kinds of stamps used around the world. <1> Me too, I would love to have some old stamps that were issued in the 1840 when some one the worlds first stamps were issued. <0> That would be cool! My best friend from tanzania some times sends me the stamps they have over there. <1> That is so amazing! My best friend is visiting me from Tanzania next week! <0> That's so cool! what are you guys gonna do? <1> He is just as passionate about collecting stamps as I am so we are going to go to a few auctions and seee if there are any good deals <0> Always good to have a hobby you can do together! My friend and I are always cracking jokes to each other! <1> Yes it is. For whatever reason when we get together, almost like a ritual, we watch our favorite movie - Dirty Harry. Have you ever seen it? <0> Love that movie! but comedy is more of my genre! laughter is the best medicine!  <1> I completely agree! You have to laugh in life for health and happiness. Comedy movies are a great source of joy in my life, second to stamp collecting ;) <0> If i can have a good laugh, i will always be happy! and haha! it's a great hobby!
<0> I once saw a dead possum in my garbage it smelled terrible lol. <1> Oh how gross! I don't like possums anyways  <0> Yeah me neither lol any wildlife where you live?
<0> Harley-Davidson is a wonderful American motorcycle brand, started in 1903. <1> My dad drives a harley are they expensive? <0> Yes, usually. They are one of the major survivors of the Great Depression <1> O wow I had no idea they dated back till then. <0> Yes, they've been around a while. They also license and market under their own brand different apparel. <1> Yeah I have seen their brand is on different apparel in shops.
<0> I do too...he was the first one to advocate for higher salaries for workers. <1> And it was a well manged company, I can't imagine how tough it would have been to survive the great depression. <0> It would have been much easier if he was a Ford Truck Man! <1> Ford is what made him famous! Also, Ford have a 8% stake in Aston Martin too? <0> That's incredible. If I had a stake that large, only my three ex-wives would benefit.  <1> I've heard his net worth is like $20.9 billion dollars!!  I wish I was him too !
<0> Financial troubles are sometimes the worst! Ugh. <1> Those are so stressful. Just take it step by step and you can get on track.  <0> You really have to. Luckily,  my family was able to help me out and get me back on my feet. It's definitely nice to have people who are willing to help. <1> That makes all the difference. I am glad you were able to get out of that position.  <0> I was not able to help sometimes so I was not worried.
<0> I found a lost baby duck. The mother was no where to be found. I brought it home and took care of it until it was big enough to be let loose again. <1> Thats kind of you,  did everything go well when you put it back into the wild?  <0> The duck flew away and was never to be found again. Hopefully he was reunited somehow with his family. I just hope so. <1> Sounds like it went well!  <0> I left the baby duck in the wild, i i really don't care about it
<0> Absolutely! Have you ever been to any of them? <1> Yeah I went to several of them when I visited DC 10 years ago. They do a good job of serving the general public. <0> For sure. I'm not one to have many friends at once, so working in the museum is perfect for me. It's quiet and I meet a lot of people. <1> Yeah.  Lots of historical signifigance there.  Like DEaly plaza where JFK was killed.  Conspiracy nuts love it. <0> My favorites are natural history museums. I have a keen interest in animals and nature in general. <1> I like Green museums. The help people be more conscious of their world and it's limitations and how their actions affect it. <0> I don't really like museums at all and would prefer to stay away from them.
<0> Can you believe that my neighbors downstairs allow their dog to relieve itself in the street? <1> That is not very considerate or respectful,  plus the dog could get hurt if a vehicle were traveling down the street. <0> That's what i'm afraid of as well! But the dog seems to only want to use it that way. Do you like your neighbors? <1> I live in the country,  so I do not have neighbors that live close.  <0> How fortunate,  my grandparents lived in the country. I would always be scared at night thinking of their scary stories.  <1> I sometimes get freaked out,  but getting freaked out every now and then is better than having to deal with neighbors.  <0> I guess but I still prefer the city with all the noise and the people.
<0> Hi, I work as a clown at a local circus. <1> That sounds like a fun job! Do you perform slapstick type physical comedy or mime style? <0> Yea it is! I mostly do slapstick type because the kids like it more. <1> I can see that! Clowns are very good at entertaining large audiences, even at a distance!  <0> I agree, I usually gather about 300 people for my shows. When they leave, they cry because they wasted their money! <1> Oh, I doubt that!!  Do you wear the typical "red clown" type of costume with a colorful wig and clothing, exaggerated footwear and distinctive makeup? <0> Mostly a red clown, with a red nose and colorful hair. Sometimes, kids get scared of me! <1> It's no wonder after the crazy clown sightings of 2016! By mid-October, evil clown sightings and attacks were reported in nearly every single US state! <0> I swear I was not one of them! I only aim to make people happy, not to attack them (unless they call me a loser)! <1> Do you find that you can make them happier the more ridiculous you look?
<0> I'm happy my package just arrived <1> oh thats nice <0> im glad it came earlier <1> yea i would be to
<0> I don't play the lottery,  ever,  but a friend recently gave me a scratch off ticket. <1> I buy those like twice a year and never win. <0> I won $200! <1> Wow! That's awesome! What did you do with it? <0> I blew it on online video games,  lol. <1> Hey,  why not? It's unexpected money!
<0> I have been married for ten years. Since we aren't swingers,  I'm a one man kinda lady. <1> That's cool. I am not a swinger either. <0> Staying with the same guy day in and day out over a long period of time can be tough.
<0> Baking is a favorite hobby of mine, especially baking bread. What are some of your favorite pasties? <1> My pastime or pasties ?Don't understand your questions <0> Pastries, as in baking. Baked goods <1> Oh pastries ,do you mean flour or ingredients used in baking cake,bread et al ? <0> Yes, do you like baked goods, or are you a gluten free dieter? <1> Well not all about backed goods,I do others too.I really am not a gluten free dieter,except you can let me know what it means
<0> I've been recently thinking about the things we don't appreciate. <1> I think it's very common that we take things for granted.  <0> Is there anything that can change that? <1> I think you can really think about all that you have,  and show your thanks that you have these things.  <0> That automatically means I have so much to be grateful for.
<0> I absolutely love the color red. Strawberries are red and ladybugs, many of my favorites. <1> Nice! Remember ROY G. BIV? I didn't realize there was so much science to it. Red is the longest wavelength <0> I never knew that. Cool. <1> Do you teach little kids ROY G BIV? What do you say when they ask what color indogo is? <0> Sometimes. I remember them using them to teach me growing up. I've never had anyone ask me about indigo. <1> Ok so one of the sentences says indigo is also called "Ultramarine" okkkkkk....am I allowed to talk about another topic? <0> Sure, red is a rather narrow topic. I just keep thinking of all of my favorite things that are red. Like cars. <1> I work in surgery, so I guess I like red because of the hemoglobin in blood.  <0> Yea but still red is a such a pretty color 
<0> Have you ever thought about red foods? Do you know what makes them red? <1> Well I know that iron oxide gives mars a red tint so maybe something to do with that. <0> It's much worse than that actually. The dye Red 40 is actually made from crushed red beetles. My daughter, who is vegetarian, found that out. <1> I did not know that, is that when you don't eat any meat like chicken or steak? <0> Yes, but as she has learned more, I have also. Gelatin in foods (Jello) is made from boiled animal bones. I'm not vegetarian, but even I limit red foods and gelatin now. <1> I understand. I like red sky at sunset. It comes from rayleigh scattering.  <0> I really don't know what that is, but it sure sounds interesting. 
<0> I really appreciate an artists talents. It is pretty incredible what beauty they can create! <1> I agree! I wish I was able to make things <0> It is really fun to create things,  anyone can do it! But talent I think is a gift from God. <1> For sure you are born with those types of talents! <0> DO you have any talents? 
<0> I love baking normally in an oven or hot ashes! <1> Yes, I prefer baking over microwaving, etc. <0> Yes! Bread is always really good baked, what do you like to bake? <1> I like baking pizza rolls because I'm bad at baking real goods like cake and bread. <0> Neat! I think baking cookies is great because the heat is gradually transferred to the centre of the cookie. <1> I forgot you can bake cookies too. How long has baking been part of our culture? <0> A long time I think! The method of cooking used to be done entirely with hot stones or hot ashes! <1> Wow. That's must've been thousands of years ago. Imagine how hard it was!
<0> I like the taste of Gouda cheese, is a mild, yellow cheese from Netherlands  <1> Yes, I love that cheese. When I was in Netherlands I tasted the best Gouda cheese in my life. <0> i think its the most popular cheese worldwide, i like making it with macaroni, i like homemade mac&cheese <1> I make pizza with Gouda, It taste good really. <0> I really like pizza too, especially with Gouda, its a traditional speciality guaranteed dish in Italy <1> Have you tasted Young cheese Gouda? it is 4 weeks old, it is very soft, but it is hart to find. <0> I havent, now i must find it and try it :D the cheese is named after the Dutch city of Gouda, they traded with it there <1> That's a fun history lesson. You must really like the cheese!

As a child, I loved horses, art and reading.  <1> Since you dont ride horses, What kind of sports do you like to play?
<0> I'm not a twin, but I think it's interesting how two offspring canbe produced at the same time.  <1> Oh yeah. I have known a lot of twins in my life and I find it a pretty cool phenomenon.  <0> For fraternal twins each twin is fertalized by its own sperm cell.  <1> Are those the type of twins that don't look alike? <0> Yup, that's because they have two different combinations of DNA
<0> I'm pretty worried about what the future will hold. I lose my job tomorrow. Trying to keep my head up!  <1> are you getting laid off?
<0> I love red. It reminds me roses and weddings. What about you? <1> Red is a great color. It is one of the primary colors on the RGB color model. <0> I see, do you know its wavelength?  <1> I do actually. Red has a dominant wavelength of 625-740 nonometres. <0> That is relatively large wavelength. Do you know of any traditional or historical uses of red? <1> Well red pigmant was one of the first colors used in prehistoric arts. 
<0> Have you ever felt really annoyed at yourself? <1> Just all the time.Who does not?

<0> One of my favorite colors is one of the primary colors, Red <1> Red is my favorite! <0> Red is actually the color at the very end of the visible spectrum of light <1> I have heard cars that are red get tickets more <0> That makes sense, it has dominant wavelengths which makes it easier to see <1> what else do you know about it

My youngest son is blind though so I will need to find a sitter  <0> That will be nice.  The Dallas park is fun too.  I'm sorry your youngest can't go. <1> It will be okay.

Went from hot to not real fast. <1> haha! You can always count on Texas to be bipolar when it comes to the weather! <0> Ain't that the truth!  I lived in Alaska for a few years then came back to Texas.  It was just cold there!  Beautiful though!
<0> I really enjoy the color red. It can denote passion and love. What is your favorite color? <1> mine is red too it is the color at the end of the visible spectrum of light <0> That is true. I really enjoy the color green, as well. It seems like such a friendly color most of the time <1> Speaking of the color red, it is iron oxide that gives the red color to the planet Mars <0> I did not know that. I hope that Earth does not end up like Mars <1> ALso our blood being colored red comes from the protein hemoglobin  <0> That's a fun fact. Red can be a very passionate color. <1> is ot even i too heard but sometime i feel to my heart
<0> i love my wife because she's loyal and she always takes care of me. <1> thats a wonderful thing how long have you been married? <0> for over 5 years now.  <1> very nice its always good to find a faithful and loving woman <0> Yeah I sure do hope I can find one of those someday.
<0> I'm about to move and I'm terrified! What if it has bugs? Or mold? Or something else I don't know about? <1> Oh gosh,  you also scared of bugs?? That's my worst fear <0> Yes! I can't imagine them crawling on me when I sleep :/ <1> I would have a heart attack!  <0> yes! I really hate insects
<0> I enjoy bagels too. How are they made? <1> It is shaped by hand in the form of a ring. Yeasted wheat dough is used, broiled and then baked <0> I really love cream cheese on my bagels. <1> bagels are my secret actual favorite . do you work ? <0> Yes.  I work at a retirement community.  How about you? <1> worked long hours today , i cannot twirl any more dough tonight . <0> I know how long hours are.  Mondays are the worst! <1> I agree, I dislike Tuesdays because they are so far from Friday! <0> Tomorrow is Wednesday so we'll be getting closer to Friday then!
<0> i am in the inland empire <1> cool , have you heard of redd it ? i post on there often <0> I have. I have health issues and try to not eat too much red meat, so I use it for great advice from other users. <1> That seems like a great use of reddit, I have never been a big fan of red meat myself, always preferred other meat like chicken. <0> I've heard of Inland Empire. I have several homes I own throughout the country but have never been there. <1> I heard it is quite pretty in California, it must be nice to be so close to Los Angeles. Have you visited Los Angeles since your in the area? <0> I have. It's a great place for both business and leisure, but the traffic can be so heavy there.
<0> I can feel a cold sore coming on on my lip! Quite a frustrating thing before a big job interview I have! <1> I hate when those come around <0> Me too, my father used to be an insurance salesmen <1> Did he enjoy it? is that what you do for a living? <0> No, random tangent. But, yes he did enjoy it.  <1> I'm hoping to start my own business soon, I want to be my own boss <0> That's a strong move. What kind of business would you start. DO NOT START A SALAD COMPANY. I hate salads. <1> I agree! I was thinking of starting a private nursing company <0> Private nursing huh? Contract with hospitals and clinics? <1> Yes, I think the government is slowly destroying the NHS, can't believe we are to have a general election!    <0> I agree. The government is thoroughly corrupt. But you could always just avoid taxes.
<0> yea they had like cotton and tabacco plantations <1> Cotton and tea are commonly grown crops <0> I grew up on a huge farm most of my childhood years and we focused on cotton and corn mostly. <1> I was in college before I learned that the corn you see when you drive through country areas is mostly for animal feed! I always thought it was normal corn <0> That's right, and the crows and some other animals really think it's for them lol. As busy as farm life was, I always loved reading and found time for it. <1> I fantasize about moving to the country sometimes. I've only ever lived in the city. It would be a great way to grow up. <0> I love living in the country! I always get worried and uneasy when traveling to a large city like Atlanta. <1> Halloween's better in the city, though. More trick-or-treating density. I had a huge sweet tooth as a kid and would map out my route like a general. <0> I actually live in a small city these days, population a little over 100,000. Certain parts have tons of trick or treaters.
<0> I was glad when my friend paid me back money he owed me. <1> I'm glad you got your money back. <0> yeah, thanks for sending it to me. <1> No problem! I'm just glad to help. Do you loan money often? <0> Occasionally, I enjoy helping people out. How is your morning going? <1> It's busy, but I enjoy the rush. It keeps things interesting. How about yours?
<0> me too . i did break my nose when i was 10 from a bike accident , but yeah <1> that's crazy hope you okay now ! <0> Yeah, that happened 12 years ago.  Luckily my nose still looks normal. <1> That's good to know everything was okay after it healed! They said it could impact my muscle function and range of motion. But I hope not. <0> Will it affect your day to day life if it does? <1> definitely ! except i fell off my bike and broke my glasses yesterday <0> Oh no! Are you ok?  So glad I wear contacts for that very reason. <1> Yeah, I think i'll be okay.
<0> i believed my friend would return my cell phone to me in time <1> I'm assuming that he/she didn't return it in time. I'm sorry.
<0> Snoop Dogg better know as Cordozar Brodus,Jr was one of the best American rappers. <1> He is a gift to the world of Hip Hop <0> He started in the 90's and was discovered by Dr Dre <1> Yes, I don't see him sing much these days, is he retired? <0> That man sold a lot of records, It was like 23 million  in the united states alone <1> That's solid, I hope he has diversified just like Dr. Dre that's into Information Technology, I heard he is on the board of Apple <0> His songs has some intresting titles like  Death row <1> I can't really remember any of his Albums but I know he really influenced rap music
<0> I lost 20 lbs. <1> That's awesome. I just started working out. <0> I hardly work out. I mainly lost the weight by eating healthier and working hard at my job. I detail cars. <1> That will really help you to maintain your overall health. <0> A keto diet is what I am on. It's low carb, high fat, medium protein. High fat sounds bad, but the diet is actually one of the best. <1> I've heard that this diet is very effective in helping to lose weight.  You've proved it.
<0> I had a nice night in and just relaxed, im happy i did it. <1> Did you watch TV? <0> Yes I watched a few episodes of Mr Robot <1> Sounds like a relaxing day.  i have seen the first episode too <0> Ya, it was a pretty good day.

<0> my cat vomited in the floor and i stepped in it! <1> Oh no!!!  Did it smell bad? <0> no just really gross,  all warm and mushy between my toes.  <1> Ewwwww!  Hope the cat is okay! <0> He died. I'm quite sad about it.
<0> I ordered a pizza today,  but it really wasn't a pleasant experience. <1> Oh no,  why not?! <0> The guy that took my order was rude,  but I understand,  most people can't control themselves... <1> They really can't. It's still no excuse though. <0> Yes, he was so rude and abrupt, he almost threw my food at me.
<0> I like to taste Wine ,which is the tasting is the sensory examination <1> That is cool.I like to drink every once and a while but I prefer only a couple shots of whiskey. I don't drink beer <0> production of alcoholic drinks is common and often reflects cultural and religious peculiarities as much as geographical and sociological conditions. <1> Yes most acceptable form of partying. Did you know that our ancestors made beer as early as 5000 bc? <0> Its a big business.global alcoholic drink industry exceeded $1 trillion in 2014 <1> I did not know that. The unfourtunate effects of alcholism on our country is liver disease being unresponsible. Did you know marijuana is becoming the new social norm?
<0> I love rock and roll music! It originated and evolved in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s, from African American musical styles such as gospel, jump blues, jazz, boogie woogie, and rhythm and blues, along with country music. <1> whos your favorite musician? <0> I love The Beatles! Rock and roll did not acquire its name until 1954. <1> nice did not know that.  I'm more into the later music 90s and 2000s. <0> Interesting. Music in the 2000s saw the creation or emergence of a few styles, such as indie-related genres such as Emo, Alternative R&B, and a multitude of new electronic subgenres, most notably Dubstep. <1> Some great music has come out of that.  Hoepfully it just keeps getting better. <0> I agree! The convergence of different styles was one of the more defining features of the 2000s, as seen with the creation and commercial success of the British Grime genre and Trap music and Chillwave in the United States. <1> I agree too. you have good knowledge about mustic
<0> 7 is my favourite lucky number! <1> Really, well you will find it cool that various Hindus wrote 7 more or less in one stroke as a curve that looks like an uppercase J vertically inverted. <0> Really? What other cultures have history with the letter? <1> Well, the western Ghubar Arabs' main contribution was to make the longer line diagonal rather than straight, though they showed some tendencies to making the character more rectilinear. <0> Cool! I always wondered why the letter looked the way it did! <1> Well this is analogous to the horizontal stroke through the middle that is sometimes used in handwriting in the Western world but which is almost never used in computer fonts. <0> Interesting! <1> Another cool point, both modern Arab forms influenced the European form, a two-stroke character consisting of a horizontal upper line joined at its right to a line going down to the bottom left corner, a line that is slightly curved in some font variants.
<0> So my hair dressed ruined my hair! Im so mad! <1> Oh no! was it too short for your liking? <0> Actually I had to shave my head off. She used new product that burnt my hair!  <1> Yikes! I would ask for a refund for sure <0> They were able to fix my hair so I didn't ask for a refund.
<0> i work a part time job at a retail store . you ? <1> i'm auditioning for a talent show but i'm son nervous <0> How fun, what is your talent? <1> Singing, but I've never been able to sing in front of anyone before <0> Oh I only sing in the shower and the car. I admire your bravery!  What song? <1> I'm planning on doing Something in the way by Nirvana <0> I can picture you singing in the shower!
<0> I am so happy I was able to pass my teacher certification test and become an English teacher. <1> That's great. Teachers are so important. <0> It's such a fulfilling job. The test was difficult,  but I spent a lot of my free time studying for it. <1> I wanted to become a teacher before. I was afraid of how hard it would be.
<0> greetings, i enjoys kayaking in my free time <1> I think kayaking is fun too! It is one of the many common activities that involve water. <0> its a fun way to enjoy and participate in sports <1> Yes and there are many water sports. Some are underwater, over water, or in the water.  <0> I like  the over the water sports, do not like being in the water <1> I love underwater sports. Scuba-diving is my favorite. There is something so magical about being able to descend below the water's surface to interact with the environment. <0> never tried it but it does sound appealing, just never had the chance to do it <1> Scuba divers carry their own source of air, allowing for great independence.
<0> I enjoy rock and roll music. I recently took a trip to the Rock and Roll hall of fame which was fantastic. Do you like rock music? <1> I do! I especially love Classic Rock and the sound of the electric guitars <0> YEah, Led Zepplin, The Guess Who- those guys were great. Modern rock is so different. I can't stand Fall Out Boy, for example.  <1> I agree! Some of the new type of music nowadays I just don't understand. I miss just the classic saxophone or piano in some of the current music. <0> It seems like all music is auto-tuned these days- you would never have heard that in Classic Rock.  <1> I have been introducing my teenagers to some of the old classic rock and I have actually caught them listening to it without me. Definitely the kind of music we need to keep alive! <0> That's so true! I see lots of classic rock t-shirts on teens but I suspect they've never heard the music.  <1> I agree! I miss the days of MTV and all of the great music videos <0> The MTV years were my formative years- and wow, music videos were so novel then. I loved that channel!

<0> I like jazz. Do you? <1> I do like jazz.  I do not get to hear a lot of it but I enjoy it, <0> It originated in New Orleans in the 19th century, but it's been a staple since. I listen to it in the car while going to work <1> That is nice - I have mainly only heard it in clubs or restaurants. <0> Jazz is mainly associated with classical music, but it can also mix into other genres a bit. <1> What other genres is it part of? <0> Jazz is recognized as a major form of musical expression, and you could say it's ragtime, swing, or another <1> Oh yes - there were some great ragtime artists!
<0> so do i . i collect vintage european cars , mostly benz and porsche . <1> i've mainly aston martins and a few lotus <0> Do you like to take road trips? <1> I do, especially on my motorcycle. The wind in my hair on the open road - nothing compares. <0> I ONLY OWN A MOTORCYCLE AND NO CARS.
<0> I have not however I've always been interested. The teacher to student ratio seems so beneficial for developing minds <1> Yes, it seems that on average homeschooled students score at least average on standardized tests and often above, so it may be quite beneficial if the parents have the time. <0> I agree. I chose to send my children to public school and I think they turned out all right. <1> When my kids were little we did it but we had a large house with a yard and would use the yard for their recess time P.E. <0> I admire people who choose to homeschool. I have two sisters who are teachers. I think the importance of teaching is underestimated. <1> I agree. We'll they're gone now and we recently lost our dog. I feel so incomplete. <0> Losing a pet is so hard. Our dogs have always been part of the family and we feel the loss almost as strongly as the loss of people.
<0> oh , that's alright you can practice and get better . are you employed ? <1> i'm employed . i'd with food . <0> I use to go to school to be a chef in the food industry my wife was the professor.  <1> Oh that's cool.

Croissants and that sort of thing

<0> Nothing really, it's just a weekly thing for me, although I did just finish my accounting final project, so there is that. <1> You should celebrate with a drink! I find it hilarious that nearly every civilization has independently discovered the processes of making beer, wine and spirits. <0> I might just have a beer!  I am kind of a couch potato right now, since school is over.  What are you doing right now? <1> Being a couch potato, watching a movie, lounging and enjoying a glass of wine.  <0> That's awesome.  I prefer beer myself.  Do you have a job right now? <1> I do. I work in accounting at a small family owned company. It's great!  <0>  I can't wait until I graduate and can start working. I'm in between jobs right now, so I just kind of sit around. What movie are you watching? <1> Stuber! Have you seen it? It is pretty hilarious!  <0> No!  I don't even know what it is about, can you tell me? <1> Cop goes after drug dealer.

But I always need something new to watch!

<0> When I was a teenager I used to borrow my big sisters clothes without her knowledge.  One time she had just bought a lovely new dress after saving all her wages.  That weekend I borrowed it and of course ripped it!  The next day when she found out she was so angry and i felt terrible. <1> Oh no! I hope she's forgiven you since then. <0> oh yes she has,  it was a while ago now but at the time the guilt was awful.  Needless to say I learnt my lesson and never borrowed her clothes again! <1> That's probably a good idea. <0> When  I was a teenager, I would often take things without asking!
<0> I think jazz music is awesome!  Many see jazz as being America's classical music! <1> I love Jazz! Who's your favorite artist? <0> I love them all!  I can't pick just one!  The Jazz age was in the 1920s and is now recognized as a major form of musical expression! <1> Ah, do you know where jazz was invented? <0> It originated in New Orleans, specifically in the African-American communities  <1> Oh cool! Anything else cool about Jazz you can tell me? <0> What sets Jazz apart from other types of music is the swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation <1> Do you know any famous jazz players?
<0> Do you make a lot of money training horses? <1> It depends on where you live. Horses over the years have trained for warfare, farm work, sport and transport. <0> Big market in the southwest region? You should move down there if so, the best Mexican food is probably down there. <1> Do you like Mexican style foods? <0> I love Mexican food! <1> Mexican is delicious.  I also enjoy food from Israel.  Anything with hummus is good in my book.  Have you had falafel or couscous? <0> I have not no but my kids have told me about them. They are foodies and are always trying new dishes. Hell of a duo actually. <1> That is great. Have them try Filipino cuisine. It is also very diverse. <0> I think I should, or if you like you can check out their instagram They take requests for new eaterees.

<0> My family went to the zoo last weekend when the weather channel said it would be mostly a nice day. We are all fairly smart so just incase we brought unbrellas should the sky spontaneously fall on us. At one point it did, and we were not some of the many folks who were without umbrellas! <1> What made you suspect that it might rain? <0> I just had a gut feeling. I have been trapped without an umbrella before when the weather channel didn't predict any rain. <1> Sorry to hear that. Hope the weather is better next time! <0> Me too! The zoo is so much better when it is sunny.  <1> Yes and a lot more fun with out rain  <0> What is your favorite zoo animal? <1> I think Cincinnati they have a lot going on and they always have babies   <0> Cincinnati is a great city. I have to deliver a car there once. I enjoyed the area.  <1> They have a lot of things going on there now , it seems like a festival every week end  <0> Nice, festivals can be expensive though. The food is always over priced <1> Yes they are pricey on the food , the spaces are high to for people to setup in .That does not help <0> I still love there food.
<0> Do you have a favorite number? Mine is 7.  <1> Mine is 10, the number of winners. <0> Seven is the number after 6 but before 8. <1> That makes a hell of a sense. <0> The Hindus used to write the number 7 so it would look like a J vertically inverted. <1> Really??? What else you know about numbers? <0> Well after the Hindus, the Arabs made the number longer than straight.  <1> The Arabs were the first?? I did not know that. <0> Yes, the Hindus started it in the beginning. <1> Yeah I knew the arabs were the first
<0> well that is pretty impressive . more than i have ever done . <1> ll , came up with it while singing in the shower <0> That's always a good place for ideas! I still live with my parents but not much longer.

I most want to see the Northern Lights one day! <1> What type of work you do? <0> I go around the southeast part of the country repairing various health machines in hospitals. You? <1> I'm doing research work, I recently found a cure for common cold! <0> Can you tell me the cure

<0> Do you like pasta? It's an Italian dish used in Sicily in 1154. <1> Unfortunately not. I'm more of a hamburger kind of guy.  <0> You should try dried or fresh pasta. They're known as pasta secca and pasta fresca. <1> Ah, I didn't know that. I do like pasta in white wine sauce.  <0> If you have a gluten intolerance, you can make pasta with rice flour instead of wheat. That's what I do. <1> Ah, I don't. I think my main problem is that most pasta dishes use tomato sauce which I dislike   <0> Tomato sauce is used a lot in pasta, that's true, and also with meat and veggies.

<0> Red was the beautiful and passionate color <1> It certainly is, and red comes in many different shades as well. There's crimson, scarlet, vermillion, and burgundy. So there's variety! <0> Yes, in our daily life we met with various things which are in red color. <1> That's very true. And it's an interesting bit of color psychology that police officers will more likely pull over red cars than other cars. <0> Human psychology also mostly related with red color. It is also a symbol of danger. <1> Or desire, as it happens. Research suggests hetero men believe that women who wear red are much more attractive than otherwise.

<0> Hey -- I knew that Ferrari was from Italy, but unaware it is from the city of Maranello  <1> I thought that was common knowledge. What else do have you learned about Ferrari?  <0> I learned that they were a racing team before they produced sports cars. I thought it was the other way around.  <1> Did you know in the early years Enzo Ferrari actually wanted to produce road cars and not sports cars. <0> I am surprised to hear that. tHe fact that he was a racing driver would make me believe he wanted sports cars.  <1> Over the years Team Ferrari has won 15 World Drivers Championship titles  <0> That is very impressive. I guess it's why great racers such as Schumacher wanted to join the team. <1> Yes, he became world renowned for their racing cars across the globe.

<0> Preschools cost way too much for a regular working adult trying to put their child through the education system. <1> Do you know why they cost so much? <0> There just isn't enough funding in the public system.  Therefore, a lot of privately operation preschools exist and cost a fortune. <1> Do you believe preschools should be funded, and if so what would the solution look like? <0> I think preschools should be 100% funded as it benefits the public system as a whole.  Parents are able to enter the workforce and toddlers will not be disadvantaged based on the schooling they receive. <1> Ok what else do you think needs to change about preschools?  <0> Teachers should tested annually to ensure they are knowledgeable and understand today's latest teaching trends. <1> Are there any examples of this today, maybe in other countries?

Mine is a pinched nerve from a slipped disk.  <1> I have seen a doctor today. He give me lab tests to do but I am afraid of the results. <0> The waiting is the worst part if you ask me.

How long have you been teaching? <0> for over an year, really fun! <1> I bet it's really rewarding :) must take a lot of patience though <0> It does! but its worth it to teach youth about the past. <1> Absolutely, you have to know history to understand context of the present <0> "If not taught right the first time, history will only repeat itself" <1> How old are your students?
<0> Ferrari N.V. is my favortie Italian sports car. What do you think? <1> Honestly I don't know anything about sports car is it like a luxury car? <0> Oh yes, it is, it's very fancy! It's founder, Enzo Ferrari, had high aspirations for his company in 1939 <1> They must go for a whole lot of money I bet especially if they are very fancy are they legal to drive in the US. <0> Oh yes, they are, even though they were rated the world's most powerful brand in 2014. Isn't it scary to think of such a car with all that raw power out on the roads?! <1> It really is that's why I was like are those illegal here because they could be dangerous like the Lamborghini if they are poorly driven.

<0> Hello, what do you know about Ferraris? <1> I know they're italian sportscars. They exist as a symbol of opression and consumer oppulance. People with horrible values seem to desire them. <0> Horrible values, it seems you are using stereotypes to determine that. I personally don't think i could fit inside of a ferrari, they are so little. <1> They were first made in the 40's. They go real fast I hear. Have you been very fast yourself, friend? <0> I have only been fast on a roller coster, never really in a car. I'm afraid to go fast. <1> The  country singer from Australia stan coster never sang about roller coasters. I do not enjoy them, but surely they are nt faster than cars?

I think having a dog is such a joy but a lot of work too. <0> I've never owned pets, but want to try new things, sounds like getting a dog maight be a good idea then <1> I'm glad to hear you want to adopt from the shelter. Saving a dog is so rewarding. <0> I sure hope so I want to do something that matters even if it is only in the life of a dog that needs a home <1> Consider adopting an adult dog. They are most often looked over at shelters and end up being put down. Plus they are usually more well behaved. <0> Thats a good idea! My main hesitation is the responsibility for another life, but an adult dog will probably be more self-sufficient than a puppy <1> yes and normally already potty trained! <0> That would be great since I will want a low maintainence breed of dog <1> Then you have to make a good decision of choosing a good pet
<0> I can't wait to enjoy my vacation,  pending it doesn't rain the whole time. <1> I hope it doesn't rain. Where are you going? <0> Panama City Beach,  FL. I am really looking forward to the beach and resting in my suite.

I "adopted" from someone else and he was already named. Do you have pets? <0> Nope, no time for pets. Too busy fishing.  <1> Ok, that's cool. What do you drive? I get to drive around in a silver lexus. <0> I have a beat up pick up truck.

Do you enjoy making art? <1> I do enjoy manually applying material to a base! <0> Do you know a lot about the different types of art media? I have tried a lot of different stuff just not that artistic <1> Well woodworking is the art of building buildings, furnitures and other objects.  <0> My uncle could do wonders with wood.

<0> Hey! I like shopping at target. <1> I love Target! Its crazy to think that the very first Target store opened in Roseville, Minnesota way back in 1962, at the same time the parent company was renamed the Dayton Corporation in the year 1967. <0> Wow, i didn't know they have been around so long. I wonder if they lost any value after the data breach a few years back. <1> Im not really sure, I think their stocks are doing well though. Target was actually Founded by George Dayton and headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the company was originally named Goodfellow Dry Goods in June 1902 before being renamed the Dayton's Dry Goods Company in 1903 and some time later the Dayton Company in the year 1910. <0> Interesting stuff, i wonder if there is any significance to the name target, and why they chose it. <1> I guess it was named on just an idea the creators had, fun fact It was named the Dayton-Hudson Corporation after merging with the J.L.

<0> I have light brown hair, and have often fought against it. I would love either lighter or brown so brown it's almost black! <1> Do you want to go for hair dye? <0> Highlights, maybe. But as far as *changing* my color by dyeing it -- I haven't been tempted yet! But it's nice to know there are options! <1> Yes since you don't feel comfortable with the color of your hair, dyeing can be an option <0> It's not that I don't feel comfortable -- I just sometimes want to do something *different*. It's super common, obviously, in the Western world -- but variety can be fun. <1> Yes variety can be fun really, sometimes you just feel like doing something different <0> I mean, as a brunette I have thicker hair than blondes typically do -- but not as much as redheads. Speaking of...red could be fun! Is there a color you like? <1> I like black color with a such of golden
<0> I was frozen in fear at the gym Monday,  when a guy started seizing. He got so violent and ran away from paramedics. <1> Wow,  that must have been challenging for everyone!

What do you do for a living?

<0> Hey! I like shopping at target. <1> I love Target! Its crazy to think that the very first Target store opened in Roseville, Minnesota way back in 1962, at the same time the parent company was renamed the Dayton Corporation in the year 1967. <0> Wow, i didn't know they have been around so long. I wonder if they lost any value after the data breach a few years back. <1> Im not really sure, I think their stocks are doing well though. Target was actually Founded by George Dayton and headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the company was originally named Goodfellow Dry Goods in June 1902 before being renamed the Dayton's Dry Goods Company in 1903 and some time later the Dayton Company in the year 1910. <0> Interesting stuff, i wonder if there is any significance to the name target, and why they chose it. <1> I guess it was named on just an idea the creators had, fun fact It was named the Dayton-Hudson Corporation after merging with the J.L. <0> what is the J.L? <1> The J.L. was the J.L. Hudson Company based in Detroit that owned what became Marshall Fields.

OH man it's good <1> I've never had it! I love pasta with bolognese sauce, that's with meat.  <0> That sounds great to me! But, I like to add a whole bunch of things to it, like chicken. Makes it unhealthy though <1> It does sound good though. What other pasta dishes do you like? Lasagne? <0> Yup! Carbonara is another, but I feel like that's a pretty general one that people like as well <1> I feel like a lot of people don't know of it, compared to pasta dishes like Fettuccine Alfredo.

<0> I love baking, it's so fun! <1> yea bakers are great at cooking food like pastries and bread products <0> Yes, some of the most delicious foods on the planet! <1> yep its cool when bakers own their own bakery <0> True, everything is fresh and tastes much better <1> baking is quite old too, as you can imagine with grain being staple food for millennia <0> Yes, bakers have been the backbone of society for some time. <1> I think bakers are sometimes underappreciated. 
<0> Went to the Barber today. I'm one beautiful man. <1> You get a new trim? <0> I went old school. Last a bet now I have a mullet with lighting bolts on the side and a stash. <1> That's awesome,  bet you look straight out of 1990s.
<0> I don't know much about gun laws. I live in Texas, so there are a lot of people with firearms. Do the laws vary by state? <1> Yes they do vary by the state you live in it is defines by 2 groups gun control and gun rights. I feel like in my state the laws need to be much stricter on guns. <0> Texas is very liberal about open carry law. But I'd rather know if someone has and weapon and can see. Those people aren't the worry.
<0> I do not have much energy <1> Are you having trouble carrying out normal daily routines?  Could be chronic fatigue syndrome. <0> I am thinking so, maybe i need to see a doctor on this <1> It isn't something that can be cured, but chronic fatigue syndrome can be managed. <0> How can i manage it

<0> I am so happy to rekindle my relationship with my parents <1> Connecting with the people that mattered the most makes me super excited <0> Who is your favorite person? <1> Wow!  That's a tough one?  There are so many people I admire, people who have made a difference in the world. <0> But if you really just had to pick one person  <1> Angelina Jolie.  She is one of the most unselfish people. <0> Interesting. What's the craziest thing she's done? <1> Probably marry Brad Pitt, but that probably seemed like a good idea at the time. <0> Haha yes she is so sexy!
<0> I like to bake, I have made my own dough at home before and it is fun. <1> I learned in class that  a baker is someone who bakes and sometimes sells breads and other products <0> Cool, can you tell me about the history of baking? <1> Well the space a baker works in is called a bakery naturally. <0> What other things can you bake besides break? <1> Well we have been eating grain forever. So the activity of baking is a very old one <0> That's fascinating. Do you know how long ago humans started baking? <1> Im not sure but by the fifth and sixth centuries BCE, the ancient Greeks used enclosed oven <0> Do you know if any other ancient civilizations knew how to bake? <1> Egyptians were basically pioneers in baking, they were the first known civilization to use yeast in their bread.
<0> The other weekend I really wanted to go out,  but I realized I don't have any good friends left. <1> That is a bad realization to come to.  Where did they all go?
<0> I love doing exercise <1> yes you are physically fit,  it  is a state of health and well-being <0> Its makes me to be active mentally <1> It is also the ability to perform aspects of sports, occupations and daily activities. <0> Its helps mt focus on my dream <1> One can get it through through proper nutrition, moderate-vigorous physical exercise, and sufficient rest.
<0> my favorite color is red  <1> Very nice. It's a strong color to pick to be infatuated with, as it's a primary color in the RGB color model and the CMYK color model. Little do people know, though, is that it's a complementary color of cyan <0> oh that i did not know, anything else you can tell me about the color red ? <1> It's one of the colors that's at the end of the visible spectrum of light, sitting right next to orange, and opposite of violet. Its wavelength is dominant, with nanometres of 625 to 740. So, it's obviously a strong color, which is why some people like it. <0> do you see the color red in nature a lot ? <1> Well, for example, you'll see red in the sky at times due to the Rayleigh scattering, and you'll see red in the Grand Canyon and other geological features because of hematite or red ochre, which come from iron oxide. These are just a couple of examples, but red is very present in nature. <0> oh wow thats cool <1> Yes it is, I learned all about it in my college courses.
<0> I enjoy exercise, but I need to do more research about physical fitness. <1> It is a state of well-being, health and the ability to participate of sports, occupations and activities. <0> Indeed. I used to run in college, but then I started having trouble with my knees. What else might I try? <1> I was a tennis player but that is bad on the knees. Physical fitness is generally thought of as proper nutrition, exercise and an adequate rest period. <0> So it's a combination of those things and not just exercise? <1> Yes! Before the industrial revolution, people thought of fitness as the ability to get through the day's activities and survive! lol <0> I guess so. Life was harder back then, especially if you spent all day working in the fields. <1> Today, fitness is defined as the state of "being fit" as to whatever that means! lol  I don't think I fit that category! lol <0> I too do not think so.
<0> hey , tell me about yourself ! <1> i have survived cancer and eat clean <0> oh my goodness , good for you ! are you active ? <1> yes . i am preparing for a marathon and love to run <0> me too ! i aspire to become a physical therapist and run a 5k ! <1> awesome . i just started a new job as a life coach <0> That sounds wonderful, I bet you help a lot of people with their every day problems.
<0> I don't like the dark. <1> Yea,  I used to hate it too. <0> I get so worried about something happening to me.
<0> We're taking the kiddos to the amusement park this weekend <1> Oh wow! Sounds like a wonderful time. Which one you taking them to? <0> Six Flaggs Fiesta Texas is such a blast!  It's a can't miss! <1> I have been! It is fun! It better now than it used to be my Twin, Jessica, and I thought it was boring when we were younger <0> They have the very best rollercoasters!  We ride those over and over.  This weekend is going to be Fright Fest which makes it extra fun! <1> I live in the DFW area so my oldest wants to go this weekend. My youngest son is blind though so I will need to find a sitter  <0> That will be nice.  The Dallas park is fun too.  I'm sorry your youngest can't go. <1> Yes I can't wait. It will be especially fun since it will be my youngest's son's first time going!
<0> I absolutely love to bake! It is one of my favorite hobbies! I like baking cookies, cases, and breads. <1> Really! I'm not really into baking. But I do have several different hobbies. <0> That's nice! You should give baking a try. Also, baking can be combined with grilling to produce a hybrid barbeque variant by using both methods simultaneously. <1>  Interesting! I've tried baking before, but I was little kidWhen I lasted it.I really like to use my grill for grilling meats. But I have heard that you can "bake" pizza dough on a grill. <0> Yes, you absolutely can, and it tastes wonderful that way! Likewise, you can always bake your meats to make them more tender rather than fry them, etc.  <1> Hmm, So, what equipment do you need in order to cook a pizza on the grill? <0> Not much, other than a pan to put it on so it doesn't fall through the rails. Ha!  <1> LOL, That makes sense. So, going back to general baking. What do you like to bake?
<0> I am scared of another hurricane coming through Florida. I had a bad experience last year. <1> that is horrible,  natural disaster are the worst because you cant do anything against them <0> No,  all you can do is try to prepare. Do you live anywhere where there is threat of natural disasters?  <1> not really,  the worst thing that can happen where i live is a thunderstorm <0> Oh, that's not too bad!
<0> My son did it for a while, but he quit. There has been some controversy as of late, but I know they used to be good for boys and teaching them outdoor skills. <1> Yes, I know they had some good programs and have been around since about 1910, with over 110 million members, but I just didn't know how much a child truly enjoyed it. <0> Hello, how long have you had braces? I have studied science myself in college.  <1> Ive had braces 3 years.  I have a bachelors of science degree also.   <0> That is interesting. I wanted to get braces when I was younger, but I didn't have enough money. What areas do you like in the science field? <1> I love psychiatry.  My kids also love science.  Braces are expensive. 
<0> I have brown hair. <1> It has a categorized as higher levels of the dark pigment eumelanin and lower levels of the pale pigment pheomelanin <0> I wonder why brown or darker color hairs are more common than blond or red hair. <1> blond" is first documented in English in 1481 and derives from Old French "blund, blont", meaning "a colour midway between golden  <0> So records show that blond hair didn't exist before? Do you think it's possible for new hair colors to naturally start existing then? <1> Yes. Do you know that People with brown hair are often referred to as brunette,  <0> Yes, I wonder if there's a name for people with black hair since we have brunettes, redheads, and blonds. <1> probably yes, there might be a name for them too

<0> I love Ferraris, they are an Italian sports car that's manufactured in Maranello  <1> Ferraris are great cars. I've always wanted a bright red one, but would take any color, really! <0> I just recently found out they were founded in 1939 out of Alfa Romeo's race division and they built their first car in 1940! Didn't know they were that old <1> Me either. Figures they're from the same stable as Alfa Romeo - another awesome Italian car. Italians really know how to do things in style! <0> They really do! So, it's no wonder in 2014 Ferrari was rated the world's most powerful brand! <1> It just exudes, fun, opulence and, yes, power! That doesn't surprise me in the slightest, I must say! <0> I don't know an exact figure but a 1962 Ferrari 250GTO was auctioned. It became the most expensive care in history. <1> I heard about that. It was some ridiculous price like $38 million. Who on earth buys a car for that amount?!

Who was the founder? <0> It was founded by George Dayton, their headquarters are in Minneapolis Minnesota. <1> Interesting, have you ever shopped at a Target? <0> Well Target is the second largest retailer so it would be hard to avoid, it's behind Walmart. I've shopped at both. <1> Very true, which do you prefer, Walmart or Target? <0> I prefer Target, Walmart has been accused of racial and gender discrimination and Target has always been an LGBT ally. <1> I can see how you are ethically in your shopping habits.

<0> Hey, I like to stay fit. Do you exercise? <1> No i don't In fact i tried to wash my car this morning and had to stop because i was so out of breath.  If physical fitness is the state of well being, i am just the opposite. <0> Interesting. That's too bad. Do you know much about fitness? I haven't been doing it long, and would love to learn more.  <1> There's not much to know: eat well, get a lot of exercise  and sleep. <0> Do you know when people started to be conscious of staying fit? I know there were Roman Gladiators.    <1> The term physical fitness is a relatively modern term: Before 1700, fitness was considered to be the ability to carry out daily tasks.  I do not even meet this definition.
<0> Isn't it crazy that fitness used to refer to your ability to not get tired while doing normal activities? <1> Wow! I had no idea. Do you know when the current day meaning of fitness originated? <0> I think that it was in the 1950's, after World War II. <1> Neat! There has been a huge increase in fitness program popularity in the pst couple decades. <0> Yes there has.  Likely due to the correlation of fitness with attractiveness. <1> Yes! That correlation has been around my entire life. It seems like a natural happening. <0> I think that it's so desirable now because people attribute positive personality traits with attractive people. <1> Interesting. It would be neat to explore the different preferences of a person living in the 1700s or the 1800s. <0> Yes, it would.  I wonder if back then it was just an ability to work hard and fulfill your daily activities? <1> Fitness program popularity among people is on the decline.

I enjoyed my life as a person who creates computer software. <1> That sounds interesting, what kind of software did you create? <0> I create all sort of software as long as long it is an executable code consisting of machine language instructions <1> That sounds complicated. How long did it take you to learn to do that? <0> It depends on how fast you can learn the languages such as  COBOL, C, C++, C#, Java, Lisp, Python, etc <1> Which is your favorite to create? Do you have a preference? <0> I don't have a preference, it's all the same to me!
<0> Pasta is so good, a staple of italian cuisine <1> I love pasta so much so I agree. <0> yea pasta is a italian staple because it is so good and simple <1> That makes a lot of sense to me. <0> Also commonly used to refer to the variety of  dishes <1> Yeah, there are so many pasta dishes and types. <0> As an alternative for those wanting a different taste you can get rice pasta with no gluten
<0> Sushi is a Japanese dish of specially prepared vinegared rice <1> I know. That is why I said I had it in Japan. I also had vegetables with it cooked in broth. <0> Whats your favorite Japanese food? <1> I guess I like any Japanese cuisine especially because seafood is common in it. <0> Same here. Seafood is my favorite.  <1> Seafood is amazing! Do you have a favorite seafood that you like to eat? <0> Scallops are probably my favorite. Or maybe king crab <1> King crab sounds so delicious. I have never tried those, are they similar to crawfish? <0> I guess it's similar but 1 king crab leg would be equivalent to like 50 crawfish
<0> Do you like Gouda cheese? <1> i used to before i was lactose intolerant. a guy I used to work with told me that it's named after the dutch city of Gouda <0> Oh that makes sense, I never knew it was a dutch cheese. Do you know how long people have been eating it? <1> from what I remember around 1184 is when it's first mentioned anywhere so around then i guess, pretty long time <0> That is such a long time ago, are there any other cheeses that old? <1> honestly i'm unsure of the oldest but i do know that people used to make in a sheep's stomach so it's probably been around for awhile before 1184 <0> Wow, that is an old fashioned way of making it, I wonder if anyone still makes it that way. <1> I doubt it, but there could be some place in the world that they do just for tradition. 
<0> I once swam with manta rays. They are beautiful creatures. <1> Manta rays are very beautiful! They are typically found in warmer subtropical waters. <0> What do manta rays eat? <1> They are actually filter feeders, so they feed on zooplankton. <0> Are manta rays at risk of being endangered? <1> I'm not sure if they are at risk, but they are definitely protected by the Convention of Migratory Species of Wild Animals. <0> That's good to know. How do they reproduce? <1> Manta ray's getation period lasts for over a year, so it takes quite a long time. They also give birth to live pups.

<0> Do you have a bad habit of overeating? I do on occasion. <1> Yeah sometimes I have a habit of overeating which I assume it should be an eating disorder. What's your idea? <0> I tend to eat a lot whenever I am stressed out, or when I am at a buffet or a place that serves a lot of food. I try to eat slowly to help with that. <1> Binge eating disorder (BED) is a severe, life-threatening, and treatable eating disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of eating large quantities of food (often very quickly and to the point of discomfort). <0> Maybe I have that. There are times I probably eat 8000 calories at once! <1> As a chemist I believe if food addiction. Many individuals, food can become as addictive as drugs are to a substance abuser. <0> That's true. It gives you the same pleasurable feelings as drugs or addictive behaviors like making love and gambling do. <1> Yale Food Addiction Scale is interesting. It is the first measure designed specifically to assess signs of addictive-like eating behavior.  <0> How can I find out if I am addicted to food? <1> Can you restrain yourself from eating?

Do you still play? <0> These knees can not longer bend like they used too, I just mentor when I can <1> That's unfortunate. DO you follow the WNBA? <0> I do follow it, it has changed so much over the years, better for women now and more notoriety <1> I'm not the biggest basketball fan but I like watching some college and March Madness for sure
<0> I really like to listen the gospel music, how about you? <1> Since it is a genre of Christian music I'm not a huge fan myself. <0> Ohh, but you should listen at least once. <1> I have listened to it, but the whole appeal of music geared towards both aesthetic and religion doesn't really appeal to me. <0> I am myself not a christian, but yes I listen to all kinds of music, listen to 'Aretha Franklin Precious Lord, Part 1', I bet you'll like it <1> I might have to try that and see if it changes my mind. One thing that is interesting is that it is as old as the early 17th century! <0> yes, I that's what I think. I like the vintage kind of feel I get, when I listen to Gospel <1> I can see that. Churches rely often on clapping and stomping for the rhythm in gospel music.
<0> Do you know what Chronic fatigue syndrome is? <1> I am not entirely familiar, but I know it is not due to what usually causes fatigue which is ongoing exertion. <0> Any idea what causes it? Ive heard of it, and of course have felt fatigue just from everyday life, but I cant say its chronic.. <1> No, doctors still do not know the cause.  It could be biology, genetics or in someone's head from what I understand anyways. <0> Ive been looking into pain causes, has ive always dealt with back pain, been following some research being done by some doctors that are big into treating pain with weight lifting, it really has made a difference for me. alot of what they say is pain is mostly in your head. <1> I had some back pain once and it shot into my arms and hands, I actually went to a chiropractor and she bent me back into shape and the pain was gone.
<0> I fish for snowcrab. <1> Do you keep it at a port or boatyard? <0> I keep it at a boatyard. I have my own boat too, it makes it possible to fish for snowcrab.  <1> That's nice! I've been wanting to start oystering, but I'm have a baby, for the second time around. I don't think a boat would be my friend. <0> Oh my word! Congratulations! I eat a lot of oysters, I love eating all sorts of seafood.  <1> Thank you, we're getting excited! I am a vegetarian who only eats oysters. That seems funny when I say it out loud! <0> Ha ha! People that only eat fish meat are called pescatarians. But does that include oysters? I am not sure.  <1> Lol, I'm not sure either! Labels can be confusing. I'm an artist so I just try to roll with it:) <0> Wow, what kind of artist are you? I love to paint fish and the sea but I am not so skilled.  <1> I am a photographer, my mentor is Sally Mann! Most of my pieces are on landscapes and people, the capturing of the soul. I love that you paint! <0> Oh, a photographer, I see. I am not familiar with Sally Mann unfortunately. I will look for her instagram. But yes, I love to finger paint, it relaxes me.

<0> I looked at a house I really liked last week,  but just found out it was taken off the market. <1> Oh that sucks. I hate when that happens. <0> Yeah,  it'll be okay though. There's always something else that will come available. <1> I bet the next house you look at will be amazing and even better than that one. <0> Hopefully, I really would love to settle down by the end of this year. I really thought that was the one.

<0>  My cat passed away because of old age <1> I am sorry to hear that! what was its name? <0> I called him Pizza Guy <1> That is cute! is there a meaning behind that name? <0> It had to do with my cat liking to eat pizza any chance he got
<0> I can be a bit introverted myself, so I understand! <1> That's cool, so you understand.  A lot of other people seem to think that introverst are inferior or strange or something. <0> when in reality introverts are the best business owners <1> For sure, there is a book called Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking that goes a lot into that.  Its pretty interesting. <0> is that so.? I'm going to have to read this book pretty soon it sounds like it may be of my interest  <1> You should, it is worth a look! <0>  thanks for that information <1> You're welcome, it's a fascinating subject.

<0> I once saw a Manta Ray at the beach and swam right next to it! <1> Manta Rays are very extraordinary creatures with their triangular pectoral. I hope one day I will finally go scuba diving and swim along one too <0> I heard Manta Rays were dangerous, is that true? <1> I have not heard such thing and don't really think it has any basis. There are some who even use manta ray night dive during scuba diving <0> I see, I always thouht they were. Now that I know I know I'd like to learn more about them. <1> In fact I was afraid of Manta Rays, but after reading The "Warriors" which is a novel by Erin Hunter, i found myself more courageous and bold to face my fears. Highly recommend it <0> That sounds really interesting!  I'll have to check it out!  I suppose you will be fearless when you eventually dive with Manta Rays!
<0> One time when I was little,  I was scared of going to sleep without a night light <1> That is a rational fear when you are little. How did you overcome it?

How different are the values.
<0> I've never been to a Comic-Con, but the San Diego one seems interesting. <1> I hear it's the best one.  I'd be interested in going but it is too far away. <0> Me too! It began in 1970, making it one of the oldest Comic-Cons. <1> That is the comic-con that Adam Savage from Mythbusters always dresses up in a costume. People there try to figure out which one he is. <0> That's hilarious. I'd loved the television series, "Mythbusters" <1> Indeed, it was a good one.  My favorite costume of his was the space suit from 2001 Space Odyssey with a working air pump backpack thing! <0> I liked it when they tried to bust famous movie references, like is a martini actually better "shaken, not stirred" <1> Yes, or the one where they tried to curve a bullet by firing from a moving gun. Comic-Con brings a lot of people with the same interests together to talk about stuff like this. <0> I know! Do you think you'll attend one at some point?
<0> I hate when it rains,  especially for several days at a time. <1> Oh I do too! I like a nice sunny day. <0> How has the weather been where you are. <1> It's been really rainy.

Red is the longest wavelength <0> I never knew that. Cool. <1> Do you teach little kids ROY G BIV? What do you say when they ask what color indogo is? <0> Sometimes. I remember them using them to teach me growing up. I've never had anyone ask me about indigo. <1> Ok so one of the sentences says indigo is also called "Ultramarine" okkkkkk....am I allowed to talk about another topic? <0> Sure, red is a rather narrow topic. I just keep thinking of all of my favorite things that are red. Like cars. <1> I work in surgery, so I guess I like red because of the hemoglobin in blood. 
<0> Hi, I love some fresh pasta, do you ever eat it? <1> I don't think I've had fresh.

Diana Krall is also a good new singer. <0> Yes jazz developed from roots of blues and ragtime <1> Correct! It has deep roots in those genres. I love the trumpet in certain jazz songs. <0> Many say that Jazz is America's classical music <1> Correct! I think so. it was so dominant in America in the 40s and 50s. <0> Since the Jazz Age of the 19major form of music20's jazz has been recognized as a  <1> Well its seen a classic you're right. It continues to evolve.

<0> my most beloved pastime is reading suspense books <1> i see . . . well , i am a soldier in the us military . <0> Awesome! My favorite subject in school was science! <1> History is one my favorites as well! <0> I really enjoyed history too. But science was always intriguing to me. <1> Especially when the two intersect, like with paleontology. <0> Agreed. I actually wanted to be a paleontologist as a kid as a matter of fact. <1> Some of the first Trex fossils were found in Montana and Wyoming in the early 1900's.  I'd really like to go on a dinosaur dig one day. <0> Same here. I've actually found fossilized dino poop on a dig for native American artifacts once. <1> That is quite an odd find.  Where were you at? <0> Somewhere in south Alabama, roughly 20 miles north of the Alabama coast. A lot of artifacts in that area. <1> I will have to look into that.  I had no idea! <0> It's a hotbed. My dad and I would dig all over Alabama and Georgia as a kid. Need to visit again soon!
<0> I used to have really blonde hair but now it is very brown, which makes sense since it's the 2nd most common human hair color. <1> I have naturally brown hair but had to much gray so I went blonde too. <0> Well my hair is brown now, or brunette as a lot of people call it. <1> Hair is just the pgmentation of the follicles due to two types of melanin, eumelanin and pheomelanin. <0> I know, this pigmentation is what determines darker or paler hair colors. <1> The hair color of mummies or buried bodies can change. That is why Egyptian mummies have reddish hair. the melanin breaks down when oxidized <0> That's oddly similar to iron rust. Speaking of this, hair color can often determine hair thickness, like red hair being the thinnest. <1> Really. Malnutrition can cause hair to get lighter , thinner and more brittle. Dark hair can turn reddish or blondish.
<0> i was channel surfing and ran across the old Batman tv show,  brought back memories. <1> That is cool! I love flash backs from the past especially when it comes to television. I sometimes watch old shows on youtube that I used to watch as a kid. Love it! <0> same here,  I loved watching Batman as a kid and could not wait to get home from school to watch it. <1> I used to watch the Wonder Years after school. I love watching it until this very day.  <0> The wonder years is a good show. What is your favorite episode?
<0> I like Target. It's the second-largest discount store retailer in the United States <1> Yes, I like shopping there too. They have some different items than other similar stores. <0> Yeah, they have interesting things in their stores. They have found success as a cheap-chic player in the industry. <1> Yes, they definitely have found a niche in the market. I wished they were in some of the smaller cities though. <0> Me too. I grew up in a small town and always had to travel to another city to visit Target. The first store actually opened in the small town of Roseville, Minnesota in 1962 <1> For some reason, I thought they had been around longer. But, that's still a long time. <0> I recently moved to a large town and there's a Target close to where I live. I shop there alot now.
<0> I was only asleep for an hour last night and I jumped out of bed! There was this smacking noise on my window it freaked me out! <1> Yikes! did you figure out what it was? <0> No, but it was probably just a branch or something. It's getting windy.  <1> Bad weather inbound? <0> Yeah, it is supposed to get very cold and windy soon. Maybe some storms as well.  <1> It stays pretty warm where we are down south. Thank goodness too, I dont want my girlfriend trudging through the snow pregnant <0> Yeah I miss the warm weather of the South, I just recently moved to the West coast. That is great news! When are you guys expecting? <1> Well, shes about six months along now, so it shouldn't be too much longer, seems like its gonna be a January baby if all goes well <0> I wish you luck with that, must be a lot to deal with! Is it your first child?  <1> Yes. But I think we will be okay, I am the only one who works so she can stay home and focus on the child. 
<0> hello , how are you ? did you major in chemistry too ? <1> i'm angry . my parents keep making me go to school even though i hate it <0> omg me too ! i graduated , but ended up working at a bookstore ! <1> dose your bookstore sell p o box ? i know some do and i love it . <0> sorry , no , and they went out of business . it was a weird fashion hipster place . <1> i don't have that many friends to play with anyways . how old are you ? <0> i am 35 . but i still go dancing on the weekends ! how old are you ? <1> 12 . i want to leave school as soon as i am old enough .
<0> Last week,  my girlfriend invited me to meet her parents. The whole time I was on edge because I wanted to make a good impression. <1> That's nerve wracking for sure.  How did it go? <0> Well we had dinner and the whole time a was stuttering because her father was asking very personal questions,  but I think they liked me. <1> It probably went well,  despite the common jokes most parents want their child to date someone good so try to look for the best in people. <0> I hope you're right! I want her family to like me.
<0> I used to have bright red hair but as the years have gone by it has become more brown. <1> I had blonde hair that turns brown... I hate it so I dye it blonde. It is the 2nd most common hair color. <0> I don't bother dying mine. I think I'm starting to get a few grey hairs anyway. The brown/red balance is the least of my worries. <1> You must not be a female.. lol I mean brown varies from light to dark, but I prefer blonde <0> You guessed correctly! But I did once have hair down to my shoulders. Perfect little red ringlets. <1> I find it interesting that brown hair is thicker than blonde but red hair is even thicker. <0> It's true! My individual hairs are quite thin and silky, but the density of folicles on my scalp is 3 times that of other people. <1> Nice! Australian Aborigines and Melanesians are mainly brown too.
<0> I love it when the buildbuilding is comingfrom me <1> That's awesome,  I wish I could build my own house. <0> Is the conversation over? You are welcome then. <1> Well thank you as well. <0> What type of house would you like to build for yourself?
<0> i love me some pasta <1> it is very good! Pasta  is a staple food of traditional Italian cuisine <0> when was it created <1> if i recall first reference dating to 1154 in Sicily <0> what can you make with it <1> commonly used to refer to the variety of pasta dishes, pasta is typically a noodle made from an unleavened dough. you can make a lot of differnet pasta <0> Like what??
<0> I'm thinking of buying a Ferrari - I hear that it's a pretty fast car! <1> Yeah they are fast! They are italian sports cars and they are based in Maranello! <0> Awesome!  How long have they been around? <1> 1939! Enzo Farrari had built the first car in 1940! <0> Wow! That was a long time ago, they must be good cars!
<0> i am hoping to win the lottery this week <1> That would be a dream <0> If I do win, I may have to share the winnings with my Reddit family as I post there a lot. <1> Yeah, people do like impulse spending that comes with wagering money. <0> And honestly, that would be me. I'd have to buy a new car that was blue because I LOVE the color blue. <1> What kind of car would you get, what would be your dream car? <0> Probably an Aston Martin Vanquish because James Bond drives it. But instead of silver, I'd have to have a blue one. lol <1> That's a very nice car! Yeah, that's something I would get too. <0> I know it sounds crazy, but I'm obsessed with the color blue. Like, I only like Facebook because they use the color blue. <1> Haha, my shirt is kind of blue, i guess it is a really cool and versatile color. Reminds me of Sonic the Hedgehog <0> Indeed it does! Makes me miss that old game. I guess his color was why I loved it so much! <1> Yeah! I love video games myself, i design them for a living.  <0> That sounds like a very difficult profession. A few people on Reddit I talk to design them as well. So you enjoy it?
<0> My coworker gave a really nice presentation at work today. <1> About what?!
<0> Oh really, thats cool, what was your best time or average time? <1> My best 5k run time is so embarassing I'd rather not say. I curse the gods for the whole 3.1 miles. <0> lol Its ok you have to start somewhere, right. <1> True!  At least I  have started I suppose.   <0> Yes , that is the hardest part, I believe. <1> It really is!  I once ran a mile under 4 minutes, but that was a LONG time ago! <0> well that is great time, im sure you can bring your time down with dedication <1> We will see.  Do you enjoy running? <0> Not much running, nut I do enjoy lifting weights <1> awesome ! whats the most you have lifted ? <0> 265lb bench press
<0> Speaking of babies,  I got to meet my nephews yesterday! <1> Are they twins?! <0> Yes!  They are so sweet. I don't even like kids and I really felt my heart warm up to them. <1> Awww! Twins seem like a handful but also very exciting at the same time! <0> i really love kids, they are always adorable at their tender age.
<0> Just walked my dog 2 miles and now we are just chilled out, relaxing on the couch. It's been a good day! <1> That's a good effective walk! <0> I know, I'm on a diet, so I can lose weight and get hearty with my dog <1> That will really help you to maintain your overall health.
<0> I was a bit upset when my parents could not visit me this weekend. <1> Aw,  that stinks. Why couldn't they come? <0> My dad had to work last minute. I got everything ready for them. Oh well. <1> That sounds really disappointing. Hopefully,  you'll be able to see them soon! I'm sure they were excited too. <0> humn i hope so.

<0> I just love baking for other people! I like making breads and cakes. <1> I really enjoy baking too, although i only know how to make cookies <0> Cookies are fun to make too! When you bake cookies, heat is gradually transferred from the surface to the center. <1> Do you happen to know how far does baking go? <0> Baking goes way back. Historically, baking is performed by women at home, and by men in bakeries. <1> I really like going to the bakery in the morning when everything is freshmade <0> Me too! It's always nice to have some handmade warm bread. Baking has become more industrialized, so most of it is now automated by machines in factories. <1> Yeah, do you know if it is hard to bake cakes? i have always wanted to make a cake myself but i was never able too

Except when they tease my curly red hair. <1> what! i love red hair and curly on top of that youre lucky in my book  <0> haha thanks for saying that
<0> My favorite color is red. I think it looks great by itself or contrasted with blue. Do you like red? <1> I love red from the bluish-red of crimson to the yellow tinged scarlet, it is probably the most prominent color. <0> Yes, there are so many shades of red. I think my favorite one is firehouse red, which is very bright and luminous. Red is also a primary color. <1> Yea its been a big part across many cultures due to it being the color of blood, it was used in Mayans and Egyptians ceremonies, as well as by the Romans. <0> That is a great point. They must have attached a lot of significance to red. I wonder if they even dressed in red. <1> Actually red became a big color for costumes and outfits in the Renaissance period among nobility and royalty. <0> Interesting. I think of Mardi Gras today where there are many revelers wearing red. It is a very festive color! <1> I think it's interesting how much color means to different cultures and events!
<0> I just love pasta - do you? <1> I love pasta! and overall all italian cuisine, you know typical food from italy <0> I just love all the different toppings you can put on it - and you can get so creative with them also <1> Well, Italy, with around 61 million inhabitants and being the fourth mos populous EU member state they sure have a lot o chefs and a lot of diferent recipies! <0> wow - I didn't realize that many lived there. <1> Yes i was there in 2013 and being there i was able to try fresh pasta! the one that we usually weat its dried pasta those are the two categories they have <0> I thought Italy was a very populated place.

Sounds like they take care of their town. <0> Yes sure <1> Sounds like they are careless
<0> Red is my favorite color.  It is known for being at the end of the visible spectrum of light. <1> Isn't the color red supposed to excite and inflame the passions? <0> Yes that is true.  I've also heard it increases blood pressure! <1> I understand it is not to be used, or used sparingly in classrooms. <0> I have never heard that?  Where did you read that? <1> Teacher school! <0> Interesting fact, Iron oxide is what gives Mars the red color. <1> I wonder if Mars is a potential mining source for iron in the future?
<0> I don't. Are there any benefits to homeschooling versus public school? <1> Yes there is different. Home schooling is usually conducted by a parent or tutor. <0> the bad thing about homeschooling, there's no social interactions <1> Yes, you are right about that. But you concentrate more on your studies, since being alone, nobody can distract you. <0> exactly! <1> That is the biggest benefit. I have done my painting studies from my home. <0> what do you think of eating less animal products or stop eating them at all <1> I have stopped eating all animal products.
<0> I have CFS, is a medical condition characterized by long-term fatigue and other symptoms  <1> I'm sorry to hear that! Is there any treatment for CFS? <0> Not really it can be troublesome .  fatigue is not due to strenuous ongoing exertion, is not much relieved by rest, <1> That doesn't sound like much fun! What causes CFS? <0> It is chronic fatigue syndrome. No medications or procedures have been approved  <1> Is it genetic, viral or does someone just develop the condition out of the blue? <0> It is unknown what causes it. Evidence suggests that cognitive behavioral therapy and a gradual increase in activity <1> That is serious. Is there a way one can prevent having it?
<0> I think so!! What's typically inside a taco? <1> well you can make a taco with a variety of fillings such as beef, pork chicken, seafood and vegetables with cheese  <0> What are you favorite fillings or toppings for tacos? <1>  I love chicken and chorizo with sour cream, cilantro, and onion <0> That sounds good, minus the cilantro. I am not a fan of it. <1> that is too bad ! ! you are missing out ! <0> So I've been told. I can tolerate it in some salsas, but only freshly made ones. <1> Fresh made salsa is the only way to go! Do you like any other Hispanic food?
<0> oh no . never heard of it . i play black ops zombies tho . <1> my brother plays that , and rainbow siege . <0> i'm not really good at playing the game.  i just like the challenge. <1> my little brother loves cod!!! hes good too!! <0> wow! what made your little brother like cod? <1> I bought it for him and he just played a lot!! plenty of time in chicago to game when it snows! <0> oh!  that would explain it.  who is his favorite avatar? <1> he likes the modern players, donald i think! <0> I don't think I know that person.
<0> i am feeling very guilty recently as i am putting a lot of stress on my body and not sleeping enough,  it's making me feel very bad <1> I know how that feels and it can make you sick very fast. Do whatever you can to try and get enough sleep.
<0> Man that was hard to deal with today. <1> What was? <0> I had a lull in work and the store was empty,  and there was nobody in there for an hour.  I was about to go insane. <1> Really? Did you manage to cope? <0> First it was just boring then I started to actually get pretty lonely.  I saw if there was something I could read while I waited. <1> And was there?

<0> My wife just gave birth to our 11th child.  <1> That's awesome! Congratulations. <0> do you have any kids <1> No, I had a vasectomy years ago <0> ouch. did it hurt <1> No, it just like someone pinching your elbow really hard <0> interesting. i'm thinking i should get one, 11 kids is probably enough <1> How do you afford all their stuff? <0> lots of passing down stuff from the older to the younger ones <1> O that makes sense! How many boys/girls so you have <0> 9 girls 2 boys. I need a vacation. <1> Haha yea I imagine! Where would you go <0> somewhere cold, then the kids wouldnt want to come with, and that'd be perfect. <1> I'm sure it would be fun by the way.
<0> I was so nervous to ride that roller coaster, but my sister was begging me to go. <1> Oh, I know that feeling!

Do you wake up very early for your job? <1> I wake up around 6 am. What time you get up?
<0> I've never dyed my hair before, but I've considered it!  <1> Yeah hair dyeing is pretty popular. I like having blonde hair so I haven't changed it. <0> I once had a friend telly me i should dye it a gray ombre, but I am honestly too lazy to care that much. I also like my natural hair color (dark brown) <1> Nice..Yeah I prefer natural hair colors. I usually associate gray and white with age. <0> gray and white hair color are fun
<0> i was frustrated because i could not print a document,  and a co worker showed me a keyboard shortcut to find it everytime. <1> That had to be relief. So now you won't have to deal with that frustration again. <0> Yes indeed,  it was frustrating!  I didn't have time to mess with it everytime i had to print something.

<0> I'm so happy,  My jalapeno plants are producing so many peppers. <1> That's great news! Congrats! My garden is not doing great this year. Do you grow anything else?
<0> That's nice -- he or she must have made an impression! What stood out about them? <1> Well obviously he did all the maintenance, but he also did security duties. He was just super friendly and if kids weren't getting along or picking on each other, he'd sit them down and work things out. <0> My mom did the same kind of thing when she was a janitor <1> Are you and your mom close? <0> Not anymore, but we used to watch cartoons together when I was younger <1> Actually, I love to smoke and drink and watch the Flintstones in my spare time. <0> That sounds fun!  I like the Flintstones <1> Do you smoke? Do you drink? <0> No smoking but I do drink water <1> I put Vodka in my water when I watch cartoons. <0> Do you have a drinking problem? <1> Everyone says I do. But I don't. <0> Are you sure?
<0> Hey there!  I'm pretty interested in Harley Davidson motorcycles.  Dude, they've been around since 1903!  That's way longer than most companies in the USA. <1> I used to have a Yamaha, but i think that Harleys are too loud!  They do look good on the road, however.  How long have you been riding? <0> Yamaha is cool too, I just looked them up and they've been in business since 1955.  They make all kinds of other stuff too, sailboats, water craft, snowmobiles, all kinds of stuff.  I've been riding for about 5 years.  What about you? <1> I've had a motorcycle since 2001.  Most harleys are belt driven, my Yamaha had a drive shaft, which mad itVERY dependable.  I passed a lot of broken down Harleys on the side of the road. <0> Well, say what you will about Harleys, they sure do have a loyal customer base.  Their owner clubs are pretty well known all over the world.  The museum is really interesting too. <1> I haven't been to the museum, but i have seen in the news where they are moving some production overseas due to Trumps tarriffs.  It is a sad day for American Motorcycles when they are made overseas!! <0> I'm with you on that, there's a big problem when an economic policy that's supposed to help the USA results in jobs moving overseas.  Hopefully they'll come to their senses!  Or we just have to wait a few years, haha <1> I'm sure that Mr. Turmp's position is just a negotiating tactic.  When he gets concessions from other countrties on trade, the tarriffs will come off.
<0> I love pasta, the staple Italian cuisine. Do you enjoy it? <1> Hmm, to say that I love pasta would be something of an understatement, let's say. What's your favorite noodle style? <0> I have to say I love gnocchi. I make it myself by hand just as it was traditionally done. Sometimes people use machines, or buy commercially produced stuff. But I keep it traditional.   <1> Ooh I like that! Stick some nice spicy arrabbiata sauce with it, ahhhh! Have you ever had bucatini before? <0> Oh yeah! I love that spicy garlic and tomato sauce. No I have not had bucatini. Is that a type of cheese?  <1> No it's a different kind of pasta, you must try it as well.
<0> I love alien invasion movies. Arrival was one of my favorites from several years ago. Its very typical of alien invasion stories of aliens coming to earth to either invade or observe. <1> Arrival ? When was the movie produced? <0> It was made in 2016. Its different from other alien invasion films where aliens come just to enslave or destroy humans, <1> OK ,who was the producer of the movie? <0> It was produced by several production companies. It deals alot with current affairs and the threats we face from other countries. <1> Can you name some of the actors or the movie? <0> The film stars Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner. Alien invasion movies was commonly a metaphor during the cold war directed at fears of the soviet union. <1> What period do you call the cold war ? I actually thought you said it was made in 2016?
<0> Ferraris are some of the most powerful cars in the world. <1> I dont know too much about cars.  My dad worked on them all the time, showed me how to keep the basics, oil changed, keep it from over heating.  But as far as Ferraris, wow, very expensive, and thats about all I know?  Are they your favorites <0> They are definitely among my favourite sports cars, although I would prefer to drive an electric car. What's your favourite? <1> My favorite is the american muscle cars.  Dodge, but mainly because thats what Daddy drove.  Ive never driven an electric car?  Does it perform any differently than a gas powered vehicle? <0> Electric cars have electric motors compared to gas powered ones, but that's the only difference I can think of. Plus, you don't have to fill up all the time. <1> LOL, that can be a bonus at times.  Especially when gas prices rise up to 4 and 5 dollars a gallon.  Theyre probably cleaner too.  Id be willing to try one, if the company would be willing to donate me one. Im sure they can afford it <0> Hah, if your company is willing to pay for an electric car, you should definitely go for it. Would probably save you a ton of money in the long run. Better for the environment too because of the batteries and solar panels. <1> I would definatly love to try it.  I wonder if you just plug it into the wall like your cell phone or if you have to have a special plug installed.... like thoes big ones on window ac units.
<0> When was it first discovered? <1> Well it's a pretty popular fish.  They're called black bass, and distributed throughout a large area east of the rocky mountains, all the way from Hudson bay in Canada to Mexico.  That makes it hard to say when they were first discovered. <0> Yea I bet , well that is interesting <1> in the creeks around here , it is mostly trout or in the lakes large mouths . <0> Oh ok , well I dont know much about fishing <1> I love to fish. I also like fishing to reduce invasive species. They are a danger to our ecosystem.

It was released back in 2006 so that ones a bit harder to remember for me. <1> did you have the original nintendo ses(i think thats what it was called)
<0> My favorite food is pasta but I prefer fresh over fried. <1> Ooh, I love pasta! Lasagna is my favorite style of pasta. What is yours? <0> I love Italian cuisine I just love to have it full of vegetable bell peppers mushrooms and sugar beet. <1> That sounds delicious! Do you prefer more vegetables in your pasta dishes or do you like chicken or Italian meatballs? <0> I love mexican cuisine
<0> I love Manta rays! They have a large sub species called M. birostris", <1> Oh yeah. I love watching the manta ray videos where people are feeding them and they flap their fins/wings for attention. So cute. <0> Yeah they Both have triangular pectoral fins! <1> Both, as in male and female or multiple species? <0> Yeah and they have been placed in the family Myliobatidae! <1> Okay I don't think I am following you, you aren't being very clear. Do they lay eggs or have live birth? <0> Im not sure but They are filter feeders and eat large quantities of zooplankton <1> I guess they feed similar to whales.

<0> So last night I heard a window break in my house. So i jumped up and grabbed my gun to go check it out <1> Oh man, I hope everything is ok , and it was something mildly annoying like a tree limb. <0> Yeah I didn't see what it was that caused the noise. I'm disable so it's hard for me to get around fast. <1> oh wow   i'm sorry to hear that <0> It's okay, nothing happened to me. Which is good. The last thing I needed was another medical bill <1>  Good.  Medi

That was probably OLD for the time! lol  She was born in Amherst, Massachusetts. <0> true, that's neat to know, I wonder what it's like there <1> A very good point ! I do wonder what its like and would you ever visit there? <0> Sure, I bet it would be a great place to take photos too! <1> For sure , I totally agree and haha yea seems like it would be really cool to see in person. <0> Definitely, have you traveled much up north in the US? I have only been New  Jersey, Maryland, and Indiana <1> no i've not , i always wanted to travel around there though. Have you been and is it very beautiful as I think it is? <0> It's very nice in north NJ where my parents are from, hilly roads <1> Yeah I have family from there too. I work as a bartender but could imagine retiring there. What do you do for a living?

<0> Have you ever changed the color of your hair? <1> No, that is something i have never done and i don't know much about it. <0> The main reason it's done is to cover grey or to change the color for fashion or to restore the original color after the sun. <1> Then i could definitely use a color change.  Can i change my color to any color, or are there a few choices? <0> It can be done at home if you only want to go a few shades darker or lighter, but anything more you really need a hairdresser. <1> i would also need a toupee maker.  Can't i just use peroxide at home and burn my hair till it is blond? <0> Bleaching blond hair, if not done professionally, results in a lot of damage. <1> I seen youtube videos of people doing it at home.

<0> Dog biscuit is a snack  that is used as a supplement for dogs <1> I give my dogs biscuit sometimes. How healthy are dog treats though?  <0> Judging by the fact that they are always well made, and  tend to be hard and dry, I would say they are healthy <1> I guess that makes sense. What other supplements exist to give to your dog?  <0> I'm not too sure but I like dog biscuits because  they come in a flat bone-shape. <1> Yes the little bone shape is actually pretty cute. My dog gets so excited to get them. What are dog biscuits even made of though? <0> You won't believe it if I tell you that some manufacturers of the biscuit thinks  clean the dog's teeth, promoting oral health. <1> Yes I think I've heard that before. Does it really clean dog's teeth? <0> I doubt, you might have also heard of "Dog's bread", made from bran, they say this have been  in existence for over a 1000 years <1> I've never heard of that before.
<0> my friend won a lot of money the other day which was cool for him <1> How did he win a lot of money? <0> He bought tickets to a fundraising raffle. I never have that kind of luck! <1> that's awesome! what was the charity? <0> It was a youth sports fundraiser.  <1> that's a good cause!  My friend and I played a gig recently in front of a group of people that were in a football team.   <0> You're in a band? How fun!  Do you play, sing or both?  <1> I wish I could sing!  If only!  I actually play the drums.  My bestfriend is on bass.  I love it! <0> The drums are awesome! You must be very talented. I cannot sing or play instruments. But I love music <1> Yeah, I grew up in a very music oriented family!
<0> The Internet may be the greatest thing in modern world. When was the Internet first created? <1> Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. Before that, the Internet was only used for the military. <0> RAWWRR! That is such an amazing fact!  <1> What do you know about the world wide web? <0> How much information does the world wide web have about tigers? <1> I do not know, the web is a huge plae <0> oh, so I could find lots of information about tigers there? <1> Yes! There is a lot of information available  <0> Wow! I'll have to do some research. Tigers are my favorite animal. I wish I could be one.  <1> Tigers are really cool! I love animals <0> Me too! What is your favorite animal? <1> I like cats, they are friendly <0> cats are said to have 9 lives.
<0> Last year,  during the spring,  extremely heavy rainfall caused our basement to become flooded. <1> Oh man! I have been there,  I hope you didn't have anything special down there?? <0> I lost all of my childhood photos and many of my childhood toys and things I had saved,  my bible from my late grandmother being one of the items. <1> Oh lord,  i am so sorry! I have been there,  that is hard!
<0> I think that chestnut brown is a beautiful color of hair, but most women tend to dye their hair when it's brown. Do you think natural brown hair is pretty? <1> I think its beautiful, they dye it i think because its the second most common hair color <0> Would you consider dying your hair a crazy color for a month if you knew you could get it back to its original color at the end of the month? <1> Then yes :D , but i would do it at home, not at the hairdressers i would be ashamed :D <0> What color would you choose and why? Would you hide the color from others when going out for that month, or would you embrace the change and see what happened <1> Well i would probably not make it for a month and hide all the time, and after few days give a tip to my hairdresser to come and fix the change :D <0> Hahaha. I think I would love to have a neon color head of hair, but I think I would have to have an excuse for dying it. My friends and family would think I had gone crazy if I just did it for no reason, but I actually think it would be quite fun to do. <1> hehe the reason why for me i would say that i did it because i want to be like Lucifer from Supernatural drama, if you have seen it <0> I have not seen that show, other than the commercials for it. What color is his hair in that show? <1> Sometimes it is red and other times it is chestnut brown. 
<0> thank you . it was years ago . <1> so you must feel much better now <0> Do you know who Adam Levin is? <1> I do not think so, is he aa singer? <0> Yep! He's a singer in the band Maroon 5. I am slightly obsessed with him lol <1> Oh, yeah. I know who you are talking about now. <0> Seriously attractive! Whew! I met him at a concert last month while I was there shooting some photos for the local paper.  <1> You did not! How was it?
<0> I like to bake in my spare time. Do you? <1> Yes i love it! Cooking with dry heat in an oven is awesome. What type of things do you like to make? <0> I have a huge sweet tooth so lots of baked goods (cakes, cookies, etc.) I also like cooking different things like stews and broths <1> I love to make baked bread. It's probably the most common thing people like to make. A classic for sure! You ever eat fresh baked bread? <0> Yup! I actually used to have one of those bread makers too lol. I haven't eaten as much bread as I used to though. It messes with my diet <1> It takes some practice to make. Because the heat slowly is transferred from the outside to the inside, it's hard to tell if they are cooked all the way through sometimes. <0> True. It's the same way with a lot of baked goods as well in that respect 
<0> i think Manta rays are really neat <1> Too bad you have to go real far south to ever get a good look at 'em <0> Yeah but some are kept in zoos <1> That's true, I wonder if the Bronx Zoo in New York has any of them? Would'nt mind make a trip in that case <0> i dont have any idea.  <1> Well, it's a pretty big one and it's got an Aquarium, so even if it doesn't have any Manta Ray's, at least I'm bound to see something cool  <0> yeah im sure they have other animals you might like there <1> Have you ever seen a Ray in person? I hear diving with them at night is a real spectacle.

<0> hello i would like to know more about alien <1> Alien or Aliens is a science fiction based movie franchise about miners who go to a space colony to find it has been over run by an alien race <0> ho ok.. Do you believe that aliens exist? <1> while there has not been any concrete evidence, i do believe we are not alone in the universe <0> you believe that they exits in another planet or in earth? <1> i personally believe both <0> thats good. do you watch alien movies? <1> i do.  whebver one comes out i always make sure to see it.  i also enjoy re-watching movies and documentaries about aliens <0> ok.. thanks for your valuable sharing.. <1> We need more exploration in outer space before we can truly know.
<0> i had a couple of cats as a kid , thought they might be like me <1> cat can be cute , again did you ask them if they wanted to ? <0> my parents love to teach, that's why they knew how to raise us when we were children <1> Teach as in there were proffessional educators or just that they raised you in a fashion that made every day a new lesson? <0> they were professional educators <1> NICE! I considered getting into that field of work. It has to be one of the few noble professions left in the world if you ask me. <0> May I ask what is your current field of work? <1> Well after college I ended up in food service and ended up staying. I am currently the GM of a Freddies Frozen Yogurt. <0> That's very nice. Do you enjoy that? <1> Well after college I can't end up in food service . I am currently the GM of a Freddies Frozen Yogurt.
<0> hello <1> Hi, I'm a baker! I make bread and other products that are cooked in an oven. <0> i which bakery <1> A bakery in New York City. Baking is an ancient activity as grains have been a staple food for thousands of years. <0> oh good i feel proud of your work <1> The profession of baking is said to have begun in ancient Rome when the first mass production of bread happened. <0> for how much you selling cooking and some other food,is anything special in your bakery 
<0> Do you ever enjoy listening to gospel music? <1> I listen to a bit of Christian music, but I don't really like the genre of Gospel music. I prefer Christian music with a more popular genre. <0> I like that too. For me, even though I was not raised in an African American church tradition, I still enjoy the sound of gospel as a departure from what I grew up with.  <1> I prefer R&B style. Funny enough, gospel music is one of the roots of R&B music. I guess I like the combination. <0> Do you have a favorite R&B artist? <1> I think my favorite would have to be Toni Braxton. I love her voice, her style, and most of her songs. <0> I have heard of her but don't know many of her songs.  I will check her out! Has she put out any albums recently? <1> She used to be in a group with her family called "The Braxtons" in the 80s. They were pretty good, but I think she's better solo. She has put out albums somewhat recently.
<0> I have been faithful to my girlfriend of almost 3 years <1> thats great, thats how you should be <0> She means everything to me <1> It's a blessing to have someone in your life who is your best friend and also a life partner. <0> So true. When my mother passed she helped me through that. She is my best friend and my one true love. <1> Sorry for your loss.  I'm glad she was there to provide you support. <0> She has always been there for me, no matter what. That is why I will never stray.  <1> That is so important and I am sure she knows how much you truly love her. <0> I do truly love her. I am so blessed. Everybody deserves to have the happiness we share.  <1> Do you two enjoy music together or go to concerts? <0> We do. we just went to see guns n roses this month <1> Oh wow!  I bet that was a good concert.  Slash is my favorite.  How was Axel Rose?

<0> Hello, Whats you're favorite type of pasta? <1> I love most pastas, but spaghetti is my favorite. Pasta is a staple in Italian food, so I ate it a lot growing up. <0> I like the more hearty cuts like  linguini or rigatoni or bucatini  <1> I like linguini too. Pasta is fairly easy to make, usually just using flour and eggs or water. <0> I've never really made it fresh but, i should probably give that a try.   I really like to cook.  I can make a pretty mean carbonara <1> I am an okay cook, but I usually just go with dry pasta, which is also known as pasta secca. <0> What do you normally sauce your pasta with?  Tomato? oil/garlic? <1> I will usually pair it with tomato sauce. Lately I've started making my own sauce. Each pasta dish is defined by the type of noodle, sauce, and cooking style.
<0> yes . i cook various items . what do you cook ? <1> i already finished school , my mom live with me now . <0> That's nice, do you take of her? I'm still in school and love it. <1> Yes, I cook for her and take her places. She is getting older so it is harder for her to do things alone. <0> it's good she has you.   <1> Thank you, I appreciate it. I'm just trying to help her since she helped me for so many years. Seems fair. <0> always good to help out family. i'd take care of my mom if she needed me too. <1> That's good. It is becoming rarer for children to care for their parents in old age these days. <0> maybe. what do you enjoy doing for fun? <1> Well, I like cooking big meals for family and friends. I also enjoy going on long nature walks with my dog. <0> me too , aren't dogs great? i love to run with mine.  what dog have you ? <1> Yes they sure are! I have a golden retriever. He is super friendly, but doesn't really scare off strangers. haha
<0> Do you happen to know any twins? <1> I have some friends who are fraternal twins - one a boy and one a girl <0> What is the difference between fraternal and identical? <1> Identical twins develop from one zygote, while fraternal develop from two different eggs <0> So I guess then boy/girl twins are always fraternal. <1> That would be correct.  Each egg has its own sperm cell <0> It's very interesting how twins seem to run in certain families - is it hereditary? <1> It seems to be - the yoruba people have the highest rate of twins in the world - 90 to 100 twins per 1000 live births
<0> I had no idea there was even a science dedicated to mushrooms! Do you know why mushrooms taste so good? <1> Well Edible mushrooms are usually cooked and consumed for their nutritional value, Most people dont like the taste, It just depends on how you cook them.  <0> I find they're always best if mixed in with something and not just plain. <1> I like to saute them in butter with some onions <0> Have you ever tried them on pizza? <1> Yes! I like them on Pizza, along with roasted peppers <0> Sounds great! First time trying them was when my mother started working at the bank. <1> I work in a bank myself! <0> That's so cool. I'm thinking about doing the same soon. Do you like it? <1> I like it a lot, but then I really enjoy being nice and courteous to people
<0> I have brown hair, my sister says it is the second most common hair in the world <1> i have blackish hair <0> Most brown hair can vary to a black or dark brown sometimes. <1> so what is the most common hair color, black? <0> Yup! and people with brown hair are often referred to as brunettes. <1> what makes the color of hair? <0> It is the pigmentation in the hair. The word brunette is the feminine form of the French word "brunet".
<0> I love the color red. It is so vibrant! <1> Then join me friend, let's venture to the Red Planet! Let's go to Mars with Elon Musk! <0> Who is Elon Musk? Haha! I know the Red Planet is Mars, but I'm lost on Elon.  <1> Elon Musk is the founder of SpaceX which is short for the Space Exploration Company. His Falcon Heavy rocket could take us to Mars. <0> Well let's go! This world is pretty terrible, so I'm willing to check out the next one. <1> Well I hope you don't bring too much luggage. The Falcon Heavy rocket can only get 8,000 kilograms to Geostationary Orbit. <0> Oh no. Better leave most of my wardrobe then. I have so many clothes it's not funny! <1> Well we don't exactly have access to a Space Elevator. Although that would be a fairly convenient way to avoid needing such big rockets. <0> Having a space elevator would be an awesome product to make.
<0> same , lol . the indians kept me up last night at least they won . <1> rolltribe ! ! i'm a big indians fan ! <0> same lol. love watching them any chance i get! <1> Me too! I take the light rail to the games! <0> same! there is no other way! way to chaotic to drive in the cities! <1> So true! Traffic is horrible!

They seem so nice!  Maybe one day soon you can get one too! <0> I've been putting in a lot of overtime, but I'm starting to feel stressed out. <1> Sorry to hear.  I think you need a little time off.  Stress is a killer. <0> Yeah, the money is nice but it's not worth sacrificing my mental health. <1> I totally understand.  You must take good care of yourself and your mental health.  Maybe take a nice long relaxing bath tonight? <0> That sounds nice, maybe I'll call in sick tomorrow too. <1> Lol, yes!  A "mental health day" is in order!   <0> My perfect mental health day would probably be staying in bed, hanging out with the dogs, having food delivered, and reading a good book. <1> That sounds like a really great day!  I think I'll do exactly the same thing tomorrow.  But I will also play some music.   <0> Yes, of course! Music makes every day better. <1> What do you do for work?

<0> I enjoy Gouda cheese on my salads and sandwiches. Do you like Gouda cheese? <1> I do, although it's not my favorite. It's one of the most popular chesses in the world. <0> It's not my favorite, as it is a bit too pungent to eat too often. But, it's good on certain foods. <1> True. But, it's one of the oldest cheeses in the world still made. From 1184! <0> I didn't realize it had been around that long, that's a long time! Is it more popular in certain regions <1> Holland, I believe. Gouda got its name because it was traded in the market sqaure of Gouda <0> You really know your stuff!
<0> nice , those are good goals to have in life . <1> i say peyton manning at the grocery store once . <0> That's so cool! I love the NFL. My family watches the games every week. Who is your favorite team? <1> I'm a Panthers fan <0> Awesome! I'm more of a Chicago Bears girl though. So anyway, where are you from? <1> I live in Tennessee, not far from Dollywood. Where are you from? <0> Well I was born in Spain, but when I was 12 my family moved to Illinoise work better work opportunities.  <1> I've been to Chicago for a couple of days, but that's about it for Illinois. Been to TN? <0> Yeah actually! I've been to summer camps around the Chattanooga area so I have several friends from there. Have you ever heard of Baylor Summer Camps? <1> No, I haven't, but I love Chattanooga. Pretty down on the riverfront. Nashville is a great city, also. Have you gone to a Bears game?
<0> Red is my favorite color - especially crimson red. What is your favorite shade of red? <1> i like ruby <0> I also love pink- which is actually a very light shade of red. It's a mixture of white and red. Men used to sometimes wear pink suits because, as a watered down shade of red, I signified passion or anger tempered by self-control
<0> I fell off my bike the other day in front of a bunch of people. It was kind of humiliating. <1> Oh no! I'm so sorry!  I would feel the same way but you just have to think...who cares what others think!  If they can't have compassion for an accident then something is wrong with them.  Did you get hurt? <0> You're right,  the other people probably hardly noticed. And no,  thankfully I was OK! Unless you count the bruise on my ego.
<0> I watched a movie the other night that really got me in my feelings. <1> Oh wow,  what ovie was it and how did it make you feel?  <0> I don't remember the name. I was watching it with a friend and they put it on but it was about a son who found his birth mother after many years apart. <1> oh wow that sounds very emotional,  I think I would have needed a bucket to catch all my tears.  <0> Oh,i never thought you get emotional watching movies
<0> hi..i like jazz very much.jazz is originated from African american communities <1> Indeed it did.  In the late 19th and early 20th Century.  It developed from blues as well. <0> oh i think so.the american and African communities involves a lot. <1> Interestingly enough many see Jazz as "American Classical Music" since it originated here.  Since the 20's it's been recognized as such. <0> yes.there are several types of jazz music ,like cid Jazz ,, Avant-Garde Jazz. Big Band. Blue Note  <1> I love how Jazz is characterized by those swing and blue notes and all of the improvisation.  It truly stands apart from other genres. <0> definitely,the harmony of the music is very attractive.the melody also unpredictable. <1> What other music genres are you interested in?
<0> I told her I had to work because I didn't want to go see a movie tonight. <1> Did you not want to go out,  or did you just not like the movie?
<0> I have always dreamed of owning a Ferrari <1> Oh, luxury. It's an Italian sports car manufacturer in Maranello. <0> Oh yes. Do you know what kind of engine it has? <1> I'm not sure. But, it was founded by Enzo Ferrari back in 1939, and they built their first car in 1940 <0> Do they still make them or would I have to buy an older car? <1> It has been restructured back in 2015, making Ferrari N.V.  <0> I wonder which would be better. Are they reliable? <1> i think they are very reliable according to surveys
<0> Brown hair varies from light brown to almost black. <1> How close does brown hair have to get to black hair before it's considered black hair?  <0> Brown hair is the second most common behind black hair. <1> Why do you think it's so common?  <0> It has higher levels of dark pigment. <1> I mean why do you think more people have black hair than brown hair? 
<0> I was walking home late at night and noticed I was being followed <1> Oh no,  what happened? <0> I ended up running back to my place <1> Glad you are safe!

<0> Gouda cheese is pretty good, its named after a city in the Netherlands. <1> i dont think ive had it. is it yellow ish or white ish like mozzarella? <0> More yellowish. It was actually named that not because it was made in Gouda, but primarily traded there. <1> ohh where is gouda? is that in italy? <0> It is in the province of South Holland in the Netherlands <1> oh of course lol! what dishes do you make with gouda cheese?
<0> Red is my favorite color. <1> Mine is green! <0> I like it cause it is next to orange and opposite violet. <1> I generally prefer warmer colors :D <0> So do i, I do like blue too though.
<0> I'm not a big fan of gospel music but I occasionally hear it on long road trips.  <1> Yea its not my favorite, Gospel music is a type of Christian music <0> Yeah they used to play it in my youth group a long time ago when i used to go to church.  <1> One feature of Gospel music is dominant vocals with Christian lyrics <0> Oh so it's like when I see those choir ladies singing in movies then? <1> Exactly! and most rely on hand clapping and foot stomping  <0> What other kind of music do churches usually have? <1> Gospel music got its start in the 17th century <0> Wow I didn't realize that it was that old.  <1> I love things from the 17th century, including gospel music.

I just love taking in the experience in my own little world <0> i agree its amazing alone. but i do enjoy it with my wife <1> I'd hike with a wife too if I had one. When I try to find a soulmate it always ends up being someone I should never have trusted.

<0> Mantas are found just about everywhere except cold waers <1> Mantas like manta rays? I'm not sure what you mean to be honest. <0> Yes, sorry I wasn't specific. Apparently they belong to the genus "Manta". <1> Oh I see. I don't know much about them except I think one of them killed Steve Irwin. Do you know a lot about them? <0> So Manta Rays are direct relatives of stingrays (in the same family "Myliobatiformes") but lack the stinger. <1> Oh so they're like a cousin of stingrays, interesting. Are there other aquatic species in that family? <0> From what I know they're all rays, but there is a fairly wide variety. Apparently there are even freshwater varieties. <1> Oh.That sounds good.
<0> My sister in law brought our first girl into the family, the wait seemed like forever <1> Congratulations, always nice to have a new addition to the family! <0> it sure is. It all happens so fast! my kid is already talking in her sleep and enjoys folk metal just like her dad! <1> That is awesome. Your kiddo will be talking your ear off in no time. <0> oh yeah, tell me about it. How long did you guys wait before having your kid? <1> We waited 3 years.  <0> That's a long time. Ours was a surprise. But hey, it happens. Does it get harder when they become teens?  <1> Jenny's been moodier in her teens, but she's a good kid. William will be 13 next year  <0> Two teens. yikes. Well it's good that they're close in age. I'm 10 years older than my sister. We aren't close <1> I really enjoyed growing up with a brother and sister that were close to my age. I was excited that my kids could have that same experience <0> We want the same for our daughter. Hopefully it will be easy to have another. we are getting older
<0> A close friend said she was having problems with her knee <1> Ouch!  Did she hurt it or is it a degenerative thing? I hope she can find help with physical therapy. <0> Hopefully she will see a doctor soon about it <1> Oh good.  Hopefully she'll try to fix it with physical therapy first.  Some doctors love to do surgery right away when its not necessary.  Recommend that she get a second opinion.  Hope she resolves it! <0> I'll going to recommend her to go to a physical therapist. Thanks for the idea.

Ihave heard that the colour pink is not really a true colour, is that true?  <0> I like the band pink, they started in 1998, after choice disbanded <1> Hmm, that is interesting, what else do you know? 
<0> I think superman has to be one of the best super heroes alive. <1> I dunno, I think Batman was pretty good <0> I mean superman can fly and take a bullet to the eye and not flinch! <1> But Batman is the Caped Crusader! The Dark Knight! The world's Greatest DEtective! <0> He is amazing, and he has an awesome buttler,  I just think the flying aspect cant be beat. <1> Well he has his utility belt with the variety of gadgets at his disposal. <0> Thats true thats true,  Batman is definitely my second favorite! <1> batman is the bottom of the pole he has no real powers

Bread is most common but I have not tried my own yet <1> Yes,I love cookies; probably a bit too much.  I will usually just let a baker do the specialty breads for me.  But I like to bake cookies too.  What are you favorite cookies to bake/?  Or what varieties of cookies do you bake/? <0> I enjoy baking chocolate chip cookies, never last long though. I also like making oatmeal, those are my second favorite <1> Chocolate Chip cookies actually originated in the United States around 1938.  A lady named Ruth Wakefield chopped up bits of a Nestle chocolate bar into a cookie.  Thus, the chocolate chip cookie - which I love!

You get the BMI by dividing weight by square of height. <1> Oh, I thought that is what you were talking about. Yes, obesity has become prevalent in the Western countries. <0> Definitely! It is commonly caused by lack of activity, excessive food intake and genetics. <1> Yeah, also eating a lot of fast food causes obesity. Us Americans love that stuff. <0> I would agree! It can be prevented by making changes in social and personal choices. We love our fast food in America! lol <1> There are far fewer obese people in Europe, Asia and Africa. Guess we just can't control ourselves.

Do you think they are healthy? <0> I'm kind of torn, I think probably they aren't, but the hard and dry texture probably helps clean their teeth, at least according to some manufacturers. <1> I want to believe that, anyway I don't think one every day can cause much daamage, specially for a big dog like mine.   <0> Yeah that's probably true, it's crazy to think that dog biscuits have been around since the Roman times, where they were called "Dog's bread." <1> Interesting,  I guess people have wanted to spoil their dogs since the beginning of human-dog relationship..

What kind of acting has Snoop Dogg done?  <1> He was the voice in the movie Turbo. <0> I actually didn't see that movie. Is that about a car or something?  <1> It's a Dreamworks Animation in 2013 as the voice of Smoove Move the snail, lol.

I love 80s music! <0> yes thriller was one of the best albums ever made every song was a hit <1> Yeah Thriller was quite good, the 80s also saw the emergence of New Wave as a genre. <0> what is the new wave genre. i have never heard of that <1> New Wave was similar to Punk Rock but also included electronic elements, Tears for Fears is an example. <0> i have never heard of tears for fears before. what where there singles. <1> Tears For Fears formed in 1981, some of their popular songs are Everybody Wants to Rule the World and Head Over Heels. You should really check them out.
<0> So I was driving down the road the other day and passed that stretch of road that has all those mimosa trees.  They were in bloom and man did they stir up some emotions. <1> That sounds beautiful! What emotions did they bring out of you? <0> My grandmother kept those trees at our old house.  They super made me miss her and when we used to sit outside on her porch. <1> I'm sorry! What a lovely memory to have of her though. It's good to still have things in your life that remind you of her. <0> Yes it is, I don't miss her although because I know she is doing well and better off.
<0> The number of 7 is a really interesting number. <1> Well, I guess it could be! It's considered lucky for some people.  <0> Yeah a lot of people a superstitious about that. <1> Sailors have lots of superstitions that are specific to being a mariner. Do you know of any of those superstitions? <0> I'm not really a sailor, but the seas are a scary place.
<0> Thank you. I hope it's something that he will get over soon. <1> You're welcome. It's always nerve wrecking when family is sick like that.
<0> Why do you want to take a gap year? <1> It is pretty common now the gap year idea was promoted by Cornelius H. Bull to allow students more time to grow as a person <0> I'm thinking of taking a year off myself to find some work. Really needing to get my first car. Taking the bus everywhere is terrible! <1> Public transportation is better for the planet and gives you time to read though.  It is hard to do some things though. <0> I agree completely about the benefits but it is hard when it comes to going longer distances. <1> That's true. It's also hard to do shopping. <0> Exactly! I use the delivery services through Walmart for shopping mostly though. My contribution to the environment. <1> Do you like to read on the bus? I take the bus to class and read comics. <0> I'm a huge comic and manga fan. I always bring one with me. What's your favorite? <1> I collect old New Mutants from the Claremont and Simonson runs, but I've been reading Whiteout lately. <0> I've never heard of those, I'm not a big comic or manga fan.
<0> I'm looking forward to this new game. <1> Which one? <0> The new Spyro Remastered. It really makes feel think back to when I used to play the original with an old friend of mine.  <1> I've actually haven't played that series. When does it come out? <0> I think it is scheduled to come out in October. It is one of my favorite series from my childhood.
<0> i work at sears <1> How do you like it?  Do you happen to work at one in Indiana?  The first Sears store ever built was in Evansville, Indiana.  I'm sure it was quite the affair at the time. <0> It pays the bills, ya know? It's just a part time gig for me, my main source of income is working as an insurance salesman. <1> They bought Sears for $11 BILLION... can you imagine?   <0> That's definitely insane, wouldn't have assumed it's value was anywhere near that. <1> Me either especially considering my pay for selling washers there ! lol <0> Haha, how do you like to de-stress after a long day of selling washers? <1> I like to unwind with music and a good book. You? <0> Pretty much the same for me, on the weekends I enjoy riding my bike through nature. <1> That sounds like a good way to have fun and get some exercise especially when the weather is nice out! <0> Definitely, helps me clear my mind after a long week in the insurance business. What kind of music do you listen to to relax? <1> All kinds! I love trying out new bands.  <0> Same here, music is a huge passion of mine. I'm willing to give anything a shot at least once. <1> What's you favorite band or singer?

<0> Am surprised there is no response from my friend. <1> That sucks. Are they mad or what?
<0> Have you ever participated in any races,  half or full marathons?  <1> I have not! I used to run a lot for soccer practices. Have you?
<0> I like jazz. I like all that America classical music. <1> Jazz is okay sometimes but not my first choice. <0> oh, Maybe onec you know the history you might give it a try. Jazz has been recognized as a major form of musical expression since the 20's. <1> I think maybe it's because I'm from New Orleans and have heard my fair share of jazz music in my lifetime. <0> Lol, that make s total sense. I do love the  polyrhythms and improvisation of jazz though. I could see using some of that with my vocals. <1> It's definitely uplifting that's for sure. <0> I guess thats why inellectauls hail jazz as "one of America's original art forms". <1> Yes it is pretty amazing, it's my favorite genre of music.
<0> good evening , how are you doing tonight ? <1> i'm quite well . enjoying my tofu salad <0> oh yeah that is awesome . i love watching cooking shows and them using tofu to cook with <1> i only eat vegetables . where are you from ? <0> veggies are good . i love veggies too . i just moved from here from gemany <1> That's cool, what are your favorite vegetables?

<0> I dont know a lot about EDM. Is there anything interesting you could tell me? <1> Sure! It became popular in the late 80s/early 90s in Europe as club culture also became more popular. <0> Is it still growing today? <1> yes , especially in the club scene in atlanta and music festivals . i like to party <0> Do you go to clubs alot? <1> i make a good amount , yes . nightclubs and concerts . how about you ? <0> On the weekend i go out with friends. <1> What type of clubs do you go to? <0> dance clubs. We 2 step a lot. i love going to eat eggs and bacon for breakfast after the club. <1> I also enjoy eating breakfast after a night of clubbing.
<0> I love baking, especially using an oven. <1> Me too. I like baking cookies. What do you bake? <0> I like to bake bread, as it is the most common baked item. Also cake and cookies. <1> I see, and what else do you know about baking? I am looking to improve my baking skills <0> The way that it works is that the oven transfers heat from the surface to the center of the baked good. <1> So that must mean the oven gets really hot, so i have to wear gloves when removing the baked items from the oven. <0> Yup, this is why checking the center of the baked good is so important to make sure it is fully baked. Since the heat goes from the surface to the center. <1> Wow you do know a lot about baking. That is helpful advice.
<0> yes i have . that is a great movie . <1> my mother used to watch it with me when i was younger . <0> I remember watching it many times with family and friends. <1> My favorite movie is the last of the mohicans <0> I love that  movie also.
<0> I'm not really a fan of the color red. <1> I love red. All the the shades from red crimson to red burgundy are so pretty! <0> I think pink is a really cool color, but regular red just doesn't do it for me.  Maybe it is just too warm. <1> My favorite planet is Mars because it's red. Iron oxide is what gives it red tint. <0> Iron oxide is rust.  A lot of the earth's surface is also inundated with iron oxide, and other iron compounds, such as iron sulfate (pyrite). <1> I just don't see how you hate red. It has a lot of important history. Roman Generals used to paint their bodies red to celebrate victories. <0> Red
<0> Me and my family just came back from vacation we had a great time. <1> Where did you go ? <0> We went to Disney world in Orlando, Fl to see my kids have a great time made me happy can't wait for our next vacation. <1> We went there a few years back. Had a great time.
<0> Seven's my favorite number, because everyone says it's a lucky number.. but why do they say that! What's the history behind 7 <1>  Well is the natural number following 6 and preceding 8. <0> Of course... but is there more about it? Why has it been seen as somewhat of a special number throughout history? Anything interesting about it? <1> Well I have heard In the beginning, various Hindus wrote 7 more or less in one stroke as a curve that looks like an uppercase J <0> Alright, interesting. Some history there. What else is a fun fact about it? <1> The fun fact about it was widely used for quite a long time.
<0> I have a friend who is always complaining. She always has to make it sound like her life is harder than everyone else's.  <1> Well maybe it is but it could also just be she's spoiled. <0> I didn't know her when she was young,  so she could be. I think she just likes to be miserable. 
<0> Have you ever colored your hair.?  Dyeing it black, red, brown for example. <1> no but I am curious <0> If you are curious perhaps you should start with a natural dye.  It's plant based so less harsh. <1> What causes this? <0> The natural color from things like berries, bark give off a color to the hair when applied. <1> Is there a remedy?
<0> I was eating at a restaurant and as I was leaving,  an employee there gave me my phone which I had left behind <1> Oh that was so nice of them! I bet you were relieved!
<0> Yes I love pudding too, do you know which country they originate from? <1>  The word "pudding" is believed to come from the French "boudin" so it seems to have come from France! <0> It's wonderful but it is rough on my stomach.  You have any favorite desserts? <1> Any custard. What about you? <0> Ice Cream!! I love living in Texas bc there are more warm days than not so a cold dessert is always a fave. <1> I love ice cream as well. Rocky road is my favorite. Sundaes are ok too.

<0> Can you tell me more about Italian's favorite dish? <1> Well, it can be topped with vegetables, meats, and condiments, and can be made without cheese! <0> This is making me hungry for pizza, its my favorite! <1> Me too! I love a cheesy pizza! What's your fave topping> <0> Mine is cheese too! I guess that's why I love being a waiter because of food. <1> Even better with cheese in the crust too!

I do but I try to watch my waist line too lol  <1> I hear ya, must be careful with so much good food available <0> Yup and especially if its good food that's my weakness! <1> I'm the same, I even love a good salad! <0> So do I!

<0> I don't think I have. Are you referring to like chicken broth? <1> Right like a liquid broth for chicken or beef or even vegetable.  It is actually quite tasty! <0> Have you ever made your own broth at home? It's pretty easy and a great way to use the leftovers from cooking. <1> I have! I have made it at my boyfriends house, but we did not do too well! What flavours do you like?\ <0> I really like to add a little anise in the broth but my wife doesn't <1> Perhaps some Vino with it? <0> For a beef broth I'll use a red wine, but I prefer a white wine for chicken or veggie stock <1> Napa wine is pretty good, but it is so juvenile compared to wine from Italy that goes back centuries! I mean, Napa was first made a city in 1872. <0> It may be a young city, but its old soil that has been used for centuries to grow high quality crops <1> I agree, I love farms because it feels so natural. <0> It's nice to get to experience the rich soil and wholesome smells. <1> yeah,what about your wife?
<0> i got madden today, i cant wait to play <1> Oh cool, for what console? <0> On ps4, I'm pretty hyped but I got work to do first. <1> I used to play Madden a lot so I understand the excitement.  It is a fun game! What do you do for work? <0> I got like 3 jobs right now. I work in a grocery store, I walk dog and do some translation work on the internet. 
<0> Do you think your friends are looking out for you? <1> I only have a couple really good friends who are always there for me.

I drink a few cups every morning!
<0> hi there , how are you <1> i am doing great , but i hate orange . the color . <0> okay ? well , do you like any specific foods ? <1> no i don't care much about foods . or fashion . <0> that is pretty lame , considering you need food to survive <1> the only thing i need to survive is dance , i do that on the weekends . <0> right , well how do you survive the rest of the week then <1> well i work in a bookstore and i like books . <0> i used to love reading until i got into art <1> yeah , i got into dog agility classes .

I'm so thankful that I didn't freak out and crash the car. <1> Oh that sounds so scary! <0> It was very scary,  i'm terrified of spiders. What are you afraid of? <1> I hate snakes! They are like little evil creatures. <0> I enjoy playing with spiders.
<0> My all time favorite 80's band is Ah-Ha, with my favorite song being "Take On Me". What is your opinion of 80's music? <1> I love all the major trends of 80's music, it's still popular to me! It's hard to pick, I was an 80's baby, were you? <0> No, I was not - was born in the 90's. What are some of your favorite 80's songs? I really enjoy "Whip It" by Devo - it managed to hit #1 on the Billboard charts. <1> No one can dance these days like they used to in 80's music lol. Madonna, Prince and Journey are awesome  <0> Those singers and bands are really great! I wish I could have been one of their first fans when they formed in 1973. <1> Can you believe Madonna was born in 1958? That singer knows how to hold her age well.  <0> I know!!! And can you believe she is working on her 14th studio album? <1> She is still being praised by music critics? I didn't know she was still preforming in any way. Learn something new every day
<0> I've been looking into different hair colorings to mask my grey, but I'm worried about if they're dangerous. Help! <1> I dont think its dangerous, hair dyeing with enough practice is good if done on other people to change their hair color.rather than yours.  <0> Might be a little hard to get volunteers for me practicing hair coloring. Seen any teenage scene girls lately? They might be willing, lol. <1> Well you can always have it done by a professionally hairdresser or at home by someone else who has done it before.  <0> Professional hairdresser might be the best idea. Should I go with a conventional hair color, or something wild and fun? <1> Something fun sounds great, you want to look your best for the guys. just use one bottle and dont over do it or you will ruin the color!  <0> Use three bottles to make sure it sticks, got it. I could always bleach it, right? That could be exciting! <1> Be careful though, this is very dangerous.
<0> We had a really great guest speaker at work today. <1> That's awesome! What did they talk about? <0> He was a retired FBI agent who talked about his experiences in the field in the 1970's. <1> Fascinating! What kind of work do you do? <0> I'm a role player that trains law enforcement by acting as victims or suspects.
<0> Sobriety is an issue that is difficult for many individuals. <1> Wold you like to know the definition of sobriety? <0> Yes, please tell me the definition. <1> the condition of not having effects from alcohol. It is the state of being sober. <0> Yes, I believe that staying sober is difficult for many people. <1> I read that it is natural state of a human being given at a birth. I do not quite agree with that statement. <0> I was married to an alcoholic who struggled with staying sober for almost 20 years. Even after rehab, he still struggles.
<0> I didn't expect to get anything for my birthday from my fiance since he's been broke,  but he gave me a bouquet of flowers and took me out to eat still! <1> Wow!  Sounds like a keeper right there!  That must have been a nice surprise for you!
<0> I would like to be a physician because  the profession is concerned with promoting, maintaining, or restoring health through the study, diagnosis, and treatment of disease and others  <1> Nice ,so what does it take to be one? <0> It  will  requires you to have  both a detailed knowledge of the academic disciplines  and a decent competence in its applied practice which is the art or "craft" of medicine. <1> OK what institution offers the course? <0> Alot across the USA but I like John Hopkins University for it. Also, know that degrees and other qualifications vary widely, but there are some common elements, such as medical ethics  <1> OK how many years? <0> I'm not sure but i think it's usually longer than others.  It would interest you to know that  the role of the physician and the meaning of the word itself vary around the world. <1> So where would you love to work? <0> John Hopkins  Hospital :) do you that Around the world the term physician refers to a specialist in internal medicine ? <1> No I did not know that.
<0> Everyday after work I buy my dog a fancy dog biscuit. She loves them, especially the drier and crunchier ones <1> I love treating my dog to some treats too. Dog biscuits, especially organic ones, can be hard to come across these days. <0> That's right! They're like human snack food, so we have to be careful we choose healthily, like we would for ourselves <1> I like how sometimes the dog biscuits are shaped as a bone, which makes it easier for the dog to want to eat it! <0> That's true! They look really cute when they're little bone shapes.  <1> You can't always give them to the dog, or else you will spoil them. I like to think of dog biscuits as training food! <0> They can be good for dogs, too. Some dog biscuit makers say that they help clean dog's teeth <1>  You can always give them to the dog, or else you will spoil them. I don't like to think of dog biscuits as training food!

We take for granted many of the perks of being a US resident! <0> That is for sure! I just wish other countries were the same. There are so many people suffering all over the world. <1> I agree. There is a lot of suffering.  I am glad people like you and I recognize that. <0> That being said the US is one of the worst countries on the planet for suffering.

<0> Are you into physical fitness? I play league tennis a couple of days a week to try and stay fit. <1> I am not into fitness. I don't have time for it mostly. <0> It does take a lot of time. This is why I love tennis. I get to participate in an activity that I enjoy and exercise at the same time! lol <1> I've been to 24 hour fitness a few times, it is a privately owned and operated fitness center chain. <0> Did you enjoy it there? How were the trainers? I've never found them very helpful unless you paid for a personal trainer. <1> Yes, they currently have 400 clubs <0> Wow! That is as large franchise! I am not much of a gym person. I tend to quit. Tennis is really the only activity that I find I can maintain. <1> Its important to get not only physical exercise, but proper nutrition as well to be physically fit. <0> This is very true! I'm afraid my diet is not consistent with a healthy lifestyle! lol I need to work on that! <1> You should really consider changing up your exercise routine if you're bored.

<0> I really love the number 7! <1> 5,6,7,8 What makes it so special. it can be written in several ways you know ! <0> Really like Roman numerals? <1> 7 follows a natural progression.  In the Bible, I believe it stands for completion <0> Oh that's fascinating. Are there any other numbers significant in the Bible? <1> I am sure there are.

Especially while I'm sitting back fishing from my boat. I love to go fishing <1> Fishing is truly fun. We occasionally go with my friends too. Do you go frequently? <0> Well, I currently work at a deli counter so I have plenty of free time. I try to go as much as possible. <1> I'd like to go fishing more but none of my friends are interested. My job gives me the opportunity to go a lot also.

<0> Hi there! This is a funny question but what is your favorite number? Mine is 7 which is the natural number following 6 and right before 8 <1> Mine happens to be 7 as well! Many seems to associate 7 as being a lucky number. <0> It is a prime number so it cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers <1> Yes, there are various other prime numbers as well! <0> Right! There are an infinite number of prime numbers. <1> I did not know that, I just know of a few prime numbers, like 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13 <0> According to Euclid, there are infinitely many prime numbers!  <1> Hmm, yes I suppose in theory that's true because numbers can be counted up through infinity. Infinity is a weird concept. <0> That's true, and philosophers and mathematicians treat infinity differently.

<0> Yeah, you're right. I think that's why I'm so fascinated when I see foreign languages. The meaning we connect to images or orders of symbols are so interesting <1> well most people think that reading is a means of language acquisition, communitcaition and sharing of information and i deas <0> i love to read because it is easier to gain knowledge through literature since you can interpret the words how you want <1> I enjoy reading as well it takes me to a new world. <0> people also have a habit of allowing their biases to show through when speaking to one another. even teachers do it <1> Everyone should be allowed to think for themselves without all the outside influences. <0> i completely agree. having the information is vital but i think its more important to have objective, factual information first to form your own opinion <1> I definitely agree with you on that. <0> it's actually insane how people can teach children things and skew their entire world view. <1> Yes, that is very true people try and shape young minds to fit their beliefs. <0> i think that's part of why being a parent today is how hard, especially when so much of the world is still unconscious <1> The world is so much different now than when I was a kid being a parent would be hard. <0> it definitely is. i have two and my partner and i are very different people. <1> it must be lots of work raising them together with your partner.

Most Italian pasta is as good though.  <1> That is quite a long history. Here's a dumb question, what's the difference between spaghetti and pasta?

As long is the food is not processed I'm all for it.  <1> Organic helps me a lot as well but unfortunately most things that are gluten free are NOT organic and I am so sensitive to pesticides <0> Yes, I try to pick organic whenever I can, there are too many chemicals in our diet. <1> The right foods are important, but I think keeping a realistic goal is even more important. That's why I want to do 1,000 steps a day.

The Pixel brand hasn't been around for as long as they have, since it was just introduced on October 4th of 2016, but if you like cameras, this thing is worth it. Google has placed an emphasis on the camera, and it's ranked as the best camera on DxOMarkMobile, with 89 points, before HTC released their U11 model. <0> Ill never deviate from my Apple, I love it as much as I love summer and mexican food!

Just need to convert my girl...for her its like a new religion <1> Yeah it is really hard to get people away from what they are used to using that is for sure. <0> It's crazy though, with the technology, that people actually even buy cameras any more...has to be a dying business...dead! <1> I have not seen an actual digital camera in ages I just always use my phone. <0> Me as well, I only worry about the big brother thing lol ...you know they're watching this conversation now lol <1> oh yeah they always are if they get into my phone all they will see is puppy pictures haha. <0> hahaha!!! my girl too constantly taking pics of the dog in clothes ...its her baby <1> I have two Australian Shepard's and they are pretty much my life.  <0> We just have one dog, but I would like a couple more.
<0> My wife and I found the perfect house for sale and we excited to put a bid in on it. <1> that is exciting! will it be your first house?
<0> Well,  this isn't going to make me sound like the manliest individual ever,  but I think I need to tell it to someone. A few weeks ago,  I was driving home from work. It was late. i was tired. So I wasn't my usual self. I was singing along to some song when all of a sudden I glanced up and saw two eyes looking back at me,  and at the time I didn't know whos eyes they were so I was scared to death. I slammed on my breaks,  in the middle of the road,  jumped out,  and was ready to run... I mean fight whoever was in my back seat. Long story short,  I saw my own reflection in the mirror.  <1> THAT IS TERRIFYING. Until the end of your story.. then I laughed so hard I cried. But that is so relatable. I've been terrified of my own shadow more than once. <0> It seems to happen to me at least once a week. If I watch a scary movie or show then it happens at least every other day until I forget about it,  lol <1> That's hilarious,  But I also feel bad for you. Perhaps there is a way to calm yourself down after you watch a scary movie? <0> I have gotten better. I don't have to sleep in my parents bed anymore. Granted,  I am 32 now,  lol <1> Haha....that's funny.
<0> One of the saddest moments of my life was when my rabbit died. <1> I could not even imagine how you would have felt. <0> You sound like an animal lover too.  Any pets? <1> I do love animals. We currently have a dog and a cat. How about you? Did you ever get another rabbit? <0> I have never had a rabbit. I would love to get one.
<0> I left my wallet behind by accident <1> Sorry to hear that.Did you lose money?
<0> I drive a Ferrari. They're pretty nice, you ever drive one? <1> Pssh...Bro I have two of those Italian sports car's.  <0> Really? Man, I've jealous. I had to save up for years to buy mine. What model do you have? <1> I have two 250 GTO's a 1962 and a 2008. I was looking at a 2018 but you know it's time I get something faster.  <0> Hello yeah. Always looking for bigger and better. I am eyeing the newer 2018 models as well. Do you know how old the company is? <1> It was founded in 1939 by Enzo Ferrari. They built their first car in 1940. <0> Wow, I had no idea they were so old! Do you like classic cars? 
<0> i love chocolate . malted milk powder is my secret ! i add it to cookies too . <1> dang that's good ! mind if i steal your secret ? lol <0> Not at all, you dont have to steal it, it's yours! <1> I adore malted milk.  I hate that Brach's Malted milk balls are gone.   <0> Me too, I always got them in my Easter basket as a kid. <1> Nothing quite like them on the market.  So what music are you into? <0> I love all music, I flip flog a lot currently I am listening to country top hits. You? <1> Huge country fan.  Lliving in Alabama (yes I do), that's about all you can hear.  Unfortunately, I like the old school, twangy stuff.  It's coming back though. <0> I love country as well, mostly Eric Church and Tim McGraw.
<0> I bought something from the store and the lady gave me the wrong change. She gave me too much change actually. I did not realize until later after I left the store. <1> Oh,  no. Did you take it back or keep it
<0> I have brown hair. <1> Neat! Do you like it? Is it natural or did you dye it?  <0> It is natural, it is the second most common hair color. <1> Neat! I personally have blonde hair..What is the most common har color? <0> It is second to black hair. <1> Wow! Do you like having brown hair? Or would you prefer another color?
<0> I'm afraid I've never heard of him. Can you tell me a little about him? <1> You must have heard his song "Shape of you", it's very popular now.. He was born in England and he attended the academy of contemporary music  <0> Oh yeah I'v heard of that one. My son plays it on repeat 24/7! <1> He was in an episode of Game of Thrones as well <0> I love that show. Have not had time to finish it yet but I hear the ending is not the best. <1> It was not how i wanted it to end. Maybe you will enjoy it? <0> I hope so, but with the petition that was created to get the last season re-done my hopes are not very high. <1> I guess i prefer sports <0> Yeah? what kind of sports are you into? <1> I'm into Soccer, basketball and Football those are my favorite major professional sports. <0> I'm not the biggest fan of soccer but I do like Football, I used to play when i was younger.

<0> I like drawing but have lost my touch. I've tried painting but no good. Do you enjoy making art? <1> I do enjoy manually applying material to a base! <0> Do you know a lot about the different types of art media? I have tried a lot of different stuff just not that artistic <1> Well woodworking is the art of building buildings, furnitures and other objects.  <0> My uncle could do wonders with wood. It's so amazing to watch something being made. Have you ever tried it? <1> I haven't but I have tried pottery. It is the art of making earthenware, stoneware and sculpture.  <0> Oh that's fun to watch when a pottery wheel is being used. It changes so quickly but easy to mess us too <1> Yeah and then the clay is colored and fired in a kiln. 
<0> I was scared when I was in a wreck. <1> Serious? Why are you scared when you are in a wreck?
<0> what is your favorite car ? mine is a toyota . <1> what vegetables do you dislike ? i definitely do not eat carrots ! <0> i do not like brussel sprouts. which do you enjoy? <1> Looks like we asked questions at the same time about different things! My favorite car is a Tesla. As for Vegatables, I really like Potatoes. <0> i love potatoes so much. especially fried <1> Same.. though I eat them in moderation so I can stay in shape. <0> do you drive a tesla? <1> I do not, I live in the city and most of my travel is done by bicycle.  <0> oh, which city? <1> I live in Portland.
<0> Pasta is one of my favorite foods to eat! <1> It is part of the Italian diet and its been around since 1154 <0> What is the most popular pasta in Italy? <1> I am not sure because it depends by area since each shape is dependent on where it comes from <0> How is pasta made? <1> It can be made through a mechanical process but most people make it by hand.
<0> Nothing really, it's just a weekly thing for me, although I did just finish my accounting final project, so there is that. <1> You should celebrate with a drink! I find it hilarious that nearly every civilization has independently discovered the processes of making beer, wine and spirits. <0> I enjoy writing childrens books as a hobby and also enjoying drinking goes hand in hand. It makes me more creative lol. <1> That's when the creative juicy's flow lol. I sometimes do crazy things when I drink like a little late night riding on my mountain bike. <0> That sounds fun actually! I have to watch myself though, cause if someone gives me bad stimuli while drinking, I can have a bad mouth. <1> Ooooh yes I agree with you on that. The craziest thing when I drink I crave boiled eggs, so weird. <0> lol, really? I haven't heard that one before. I crave carbs it seems, like chips or crackers the most, for sure. <1> I always need to eat some kind of protein when I drink
<0> When I was a kid, I would bake a cake for my dad's birthday and take it to his job at the fire station. <1> That's incredibly sweet. That's like the best birthday gift too, since it probably tasted really good, but then showed your time and effort all in one. I heard once to make them taste like a professional made it, you just add like extra eggs and sugar and butter or something <0> I miss those days. Now, both of my parents practice as lawyers for work. <1> That is important work though! I know they are doing great things <0> Oh no doubt. They love to argue though, maybe partly because of their job lol. I order everything on the internet and they worry about me getting scammed. <1> A completely valid thought, but it is way more convenient <0> What is your work? I work for the government actually and lots of my work is in secret. <1> I run a daycare close to Huntsville! <0> Alabama, huh? I work in Dothan, opposite side of the state. Small world. <1> It is a small world indeed. I love living there <0> I like it here but me and my family wanna move further north so we see snow every year and have four real seasons. It's so hot here.
<0> salad , yum . nutrition would be fun to study . <1> what else are you into ? <0> I do a lot of volunteer work with rescue dogs! <1> You sound like a very generous person. You got kids? <0> I do not yet, thankfully! I am a little young for that right now. <1> That's smart. I'm in school, work, and have a daughter. <0> I am in between classes in school right now and working to pay for them is stressful enough, I can't imagine doing this all with a daughter in tow! <1> Yeah, totally. She's three. Can't get enough attention. <0> I couldn't either at that age! <1> I'm just glad that I don't have a job so I can devote my time to her.
<0> I'm so proud of my friend! <1> oh why was that? did he/she do anything exceptionally? <0> Yes, he did exceptionally, he join the soccer team <1> Awesome! Is he getting plenty of playing time? <0> Oh yes, he is getting plenty of playng time.  <1> Xbox? :) <0> No, he actually goes and plays withe hes team. He trains 3 times a week.
<0> my parents sort of forced me into college . i would have been a drummer . <1> too bad . the world could use more drummers . <0> It was fun! Do you play any instruments? <1> Nah!, I don't have a 0% knowledge in it? , I'm a good tennis player <0> Tennis is fun! I was never any good but liked to pretend I was  <1> I usually like to play tennis after I practice my flute.
<0> Have you ever swam with a manta ray? I saw some while snorkeling once. <1> Have you ever been in the water with a manta ray? They are large rays that belong to the genus Manta. <0> Yes I have been in the water with rays before. They are majestic creatures. <1> Where were you in the water when you encountered the ray? I know they are found in temperate, subtropical and tropical waters. <0> I was in Cozumel Mexico. We were on a snorkeling trip and say a school of eagle rays. They move so smooth and gracefully through the water. <1> I find it kind of cool that they are filter feeders which means they eat zooplankton which they swallow as they swim with their mouths open! lol <0> I did not know that, don't whales eat in a similar manner? <1> I'm not sure about whales. I also found it fascinating that manta rays gestation period last over a year! <0> Thats facinating , im gonna take swimming leasons soon.
<0> I love Jazz, I was born in the birthplace of Jazz, New Orleans ! <1> Yes! Jazz is 'America's Classical Music' Specifically I like Nat King Cole, who do you like? <0> Yes, Nat King Cole, and Natalie Cole. I also Love Louis Armstrong... Ertha Kitt sang a nice verbato in her day as well.  <1> Yes! Do you have any favorite songs? I like "Nature Boy" <0> anita baker giving you the best i got <1> Neat! I have never heard Anita Baker, but I know that her career spanned 1983-2002 <0> Yes, she was very good and I love her music. There are many more greats of Jazz that I listen to! Who is your favorite if you had to choose?
<0> Am in love with jazz <1> Jazz is great because as its spread around the world, its drawn on many regional musical cultures and birthed different music styles.  <0> What more do you know about jazz?  <1> It's considered America's classical music, but I feel like there are many classical musicians in the present day that may resent that. <0> Do know any cecelebrity   that play jazz <1> I can't recall anyone specific, but women in general have their own genre of music that discuss women's issues and feminism. 
<0> Physical fitness is a state of health and well-being and the ability to perform sports, occupations and everyday activities. <1> Yes, are you into physical fitness? <0> Yes I have always been into physical fitness to a certain extent.  I have always at least tried to work out 3 or more days a week to maintain health and bodyweight.    HOw about you? <1> I think my physical fitness days are over - I walk and that's about it - LOL!  Do you know the benefits of walking daily? <0> I hear ya, I have slowed down some myself.  I am guessing the benefits of walking daily might be to  lower blood pressure, relieve stress, maintain weight?  Am I anywhere close to being accurate? <1> I hope so, I need at least two of those - LOL!!  Do you know anything about weight lifting for older women? <0> I do not know a whole lot on weight lifting for older women.  I do know you should start with lightweights first, and not overdo it.  Physical fitness is usually achieved by eating right, moderate exercise and a good nights rest.
<0> I babysat my nephew overnight last weekend. He was scared so I let him sleep in bed with me,  even though he kicks a lot. <1> That was thoughtful,  sometimes i think kids fake being scared just to not be alone. hope you didn't get kicked too much! <0> Haha I didn't sleep a wink. He's only 8. He pretends to be all cool,  but he's still very much a little kid. <1> Kids are interesting creatures that's for sure. I'm sure you got some cool uncle points. <0> I'm an auntie :p <1> Wow, that must be so rewarding for you! (and with none of the responsibility)
<0> My friend has chronic fatigue syndrome.  Its sad <1> I can understand tha this is devastating because it limits your ability to perform everyday functions. <0> Yes.  He has a lot of trouble doing even everyday things in life <1> It can be biological or infections or genetic. Tests must be performed to find out the cause. <0> I did not know it had so many causes <1> The ultimate diagnosis is based on a person's symptoms.

Do you like Harry Potter? <1> Yes I do love Harry Potter but I'm more into Game of Thrones and medieval fantasy. <0> What's your Hogwarts house? <1> I am not all that familiar with the houses in Harry Potter.  Slithering I think is one?
<0> A few years ago after a divorce, my roommates moved away and I gotta tell you, it was rough after that. <1> I am sorry, that sounds rough <0> It was. The only plus side was that it got me away from their dog. <1> I have a very similar experience. Just after I was divorced, I tried the roommate thing. I felt empty when they left. I know what you're going through. <0> Yea being alone is tough. Luckily theres is pizza though, am I right? <1> Pizza is amazing. There's nothing I love more than banging on some Hendrix and eating some fine pizza. <0> DON't FORGET THE BEERS! <1> I hear you! But when I get buzzed, I just want to rock out on my guitar. My neighbours must hate me. <0> Dude I totally feel you! I don't play an instrument but I like to play make beats on this beat maker on my phone. Its pretty chill. <1> True! Do you also use use those beats to rap over? <0> Eh sometimes. Thats actually what I do better of. I'll go find some on youtube and write a couple bars. I think my rhymes are pretty tight <1> Any songs you like to sample or use bass lines from while you rap?
<0> I am content with my life. I have nothing to complain about,  luckily! <1> That is wonderful to hear,  good for you. There's way too much craziness in the world making people unhappy. It's nice to hear someone is doing well and happy. <0> Agreed. I have to actively distance myself away from the drama of reality but doing this makes me happier. Not sure if this is ideal but that's ok! <1> Distancing yourself from the negative things sounds like a totally healthy way to insulate yourself from that stuff. <0> Amen. I feel like it really is helping my mental health this way.
<0> i am doing ok , just getting used to my new job . how are you ? <1> great and congrats on your new job <0> Thank you. It's an online job so I am able to work from the comfort of my own home. <1> thats awesome that it works for you. I'm trying show business out <0> Show business can be a tough one to break into. I wish you the best of luck! <1> Thanks! We should have lunch together.
<0> Is obesity as big of a problem in america as some people are making it out to be? <1> Sadly, I think it is. Two out of three men in the US are considered to be obese or overweight and the rates for women are actually much higher. <0> Oh wow, really? Would you happen to know an overall percentage of obesity in America?  <1> I don't know the exact numbers, but the US contains one of the highest percentage of obese people in the entire world. That's not a good statistic for us! <0> That's insane.  Is anyone trying to solve the problem?
<0> When I wake up and know that I am doing the things that I like,  I feel great. <1> Yes I can related to that feeling
<0> I'm thinking about coloring my hair purple.  <1> That sounds cool. Is it to cover up grey or white hair? <0> Yes, I'd like to hide my greys in a fun way. Is there anything I should know beforehand? <1> Well you can do it yourself, or you can go to a professional hairdresser. <0> I think I'd rather leave it to professionals! Do you know what hair coloring is made of? <1> No but is extremly popular. Almost 75% of women dye their hair! <0> Wow, I had no idea so many women did! <1> Yes, it's a very popular thing
<0> Yes, I'm a big fan of cupcakes!  <1> The earliest description of a cupcake was in 1796 in a booked called "American Cookery" <0> Interesting! Do you like to cook? <1> I love to cook, specifically cupcakes <0> Me too! Sometimes I baked them just to bring some to my neighbour. She has a really handsome pool boy! <1> Amazing. No one can turn down a good cup cake!  <0> Exactly! Sometimes I think I hear someone asking me to bake them cupcakes. <1> A real person? Or just a voice in your head? haha <0> I am not sure really... I am embarrassed to admit but they might be in my head. <1> You could always bake them for yourself :] <0> But them I would get to fat! :/ <1> Very true. Perhaps just 1 or 2 a day then
<0> A close friend of mine is moving away <1> Where to? <0> Out of state,  it's a shame because we were good friends <1> oh,  I am sorry to hear that,  why did they move away? <0> He complained about the weather being too cold for his young daughter.

I just hope we have many more! <1> I believe you will just continue doing what you've already done. <0> thats true.  Are you married yet yourself? <1> Yes I am married
<0> I fell off my bike the other day in front of a bunch of people. It was kind of humiliating. <1> Oh no! I'm so sorry!  I would feel the same way but you just have to think...who cares what others think!  If they can't have compassion for an accident then something is wrong with them.  Did you get hurt? <0> You're right,  the other people probably hardly noticed. And no,  thankfully I was OK! Unless you count the bruise on my ego. <1> I bet they didn't.  I like to look at experiences as part of our journey and teaches us to have compassion for others in similar situations.  So glad you're alright! Hope you own a helmet!

<0> I do find that fascinating. Blue is also the color of our blood which is a rare fact. Or blood only turns red as a reaction to the exposure of oxygen.  <1> that is true. maybe it has something to do with color mixing the and the visual effects of a specific color combination. <0> Do you have any brothers or sisters? <1> I have two sisters!

The color is fall <1> I also like blue, which is the color of the sky and deep sea due to scattering of light. <0> Why is it the sky is blue unless you go up in a jet or space ship then it's clear. Total loss of color. <1> It is called Rayleigh scattering, caused by elastic scattering of light from particles much smaller than the wavelength of the radiation. <0> Crazy! So much I need to learn. <1> Going back to the color red, it is the color of Mars because of iron oxide, also known for rust. <0> I wonder how many shades of red are in this world. <1> There are hundreds of shades of red.

<0> I had a friend who was an only child and he was very shy and kept to himself a lot. Are there any advantages to being an only child? <1> I mean I guess they get a lot of attention from their parents. The term only applies to people that never had a sibling. <0> I am an only child too, it's lonely not having siblings <1> I could see where that would be a problem.

Some dog biscuit makers say that their products are good for dog's teeth - they help clean them <1> interesting. and...what would happen if a human ate them? ....like, all the time? <0> Well 'dog's bread' as dog biscuits used to be called since Roman times were made of bran.

<0> Being Italian I love pasta. Have you have real homemade pasta?  <1> I have had fresh pasta produced by hand when I lived in Italy, but have not in years <0> Make it your self. Tonight I had homemade pasta with rabbit sausage. Tomorrow it's rabbit Lasagna. <1> Wow I have heard of making it by hand with flour and water and eggs but thought it was extremely hard <0> Not really. If you don't mind thicker noodles you can make it easily on a counter top. Takes about 20 minutes,  <1> I imagine is fresh pasta is much better than dried pasta.  How do you make it? <0> All it is, is egg's salt, flour and water. If you can cook toast you can make pasta.  <1> Is it hard to make the pasta into various shapes? <0> Depends on what shape. You can use a cookie cutter or super sharp knife.

<0> Do you like water sports? Their are several commonly played sports that involve water.  <1> I do. I am a certified scuba diver. I love swimming as well. Do you do scuba diving? <0> There* Oh, wow! I haven't been scuba diving. Do you wear a dry suit that normally protects the body? <1> I used to dive in Turkey, Egypt so 5mm wet suit or 7mm half dry were enough. But in cold waters you definitely need a dry suit. I have completed my training but couldn't dive with a dry suit yet. It is so hard to dive with dry suit for me. Last time I tried it I went upside down in the water.   <0> Interesting! So the difference between dry suits and wetsuits is that dry suits prevent water from entering? <1> Yes dry suits do not get any water where wet suits get a bit of water inside but it does not let it go out so keeps you still a bit warmer as it prevents water moving <0> I see! And the bubbles give the wet suit low density, so it helps provide buoyancy in the water.

How much a person has is hereditary.
<0> I need to go to the grocery store but it is storming outside. Not sure if I should go or not. <1> Hopefully it will stop soon. That's the worst having to get creative with the little food you have on hand.
<0> it is crazy . somehow i'm still overweight even though i run after them all day <1> it took me 2 years to lose any baby weight <0> I'm still working on it and my boy is 12. lol But I have found something that works for me now. <1> That's awesome to hear.

But its kind of a greyish blonde :(.  <1> Nothing wrong with gray hair! It's distinguising. Brown hair can vary from light brown to almost black hair <0> Mine is closer to the darker side I believe. <1> Brown hair is actually thicker than that of lighter hair but not as think as red hair.
<0> sometimes i wish i could go back to being a teenager <1> Why do you say that? <0> it was so much easier then.  no responsibilities. <1> Yea,  I totally get ya on that. <0> Dealing with high school was a lot easier than trying to hold down a job, you know?
<0> Two years ago,  I discovered that my now ex-wife was cheating on me with someone she worked with. When I first discovered it,  i was angry and hurt. <1> I bet you were,  I did that to my husband when I was young. I thought it was the solution to relief from abuse.

<0> Overeating is a serious problem in the USA. <1> Overeating food in excess is quite disgusting but so many people dont stop their kids <0> Fast food chains also make it worse, I would say. <1> overeating so much food is because they aim stuff at children , tis really terrible <0> Yes, I agree. I think Americans need to rethink their food choices. <1> Overeating is something that needs to be controlled and stop kids from eating so much food <0> I agree.

Sometimes I catch myself singing as I exercise. <1> That's a good way to do it. I like to do karate for exercise, but it's hard to sing while doing that. I just got my brown belt. <0> That is impressive. Do you sing for yourself or to entertain others? <1> Just for myself. I'm not good enough to sing publicly.  <0> Maybe you should try it once. I like to cook and wonde what it would be like to be on a cooking show. <1> I am not a very good cook. I always tend to burn everything.

<0> when did the word first appear in history? <1> I'm not sure when the word itself first appeared, but pubs have been around in some form or another since ancient Roman times! <0> Well, I heard it goes back to the Romans, but unsure of the details. <1> I would think it would go back to the Greeks? <0> That would make sense, wouldn't it? Heck, I'm from Kansas and here we call them bars. <1> Yeah, we call them the same around here.  Pubs sound cooler though. <0> It does, I agree. I always thought it was British origin, for Public House allowed to sell liquor. <1> I didn't know that.  That makes alot of sense.  Either way I love going to them to have drink and meet people. <0> I'm the same, love them too. i once worked third shift (11pm - 7:30am) and there was a bar open serving breakfast. <1> That's convenient.    Did you know that the word breakfast comes from 'breaking a fast' meaning a fasting period in the middle of the night? <0> Wow, didn't know that. I just know I love eating eggs for breakfast.

They may change your life. <0> I definitely will.  What sort of hobbies do you like? <1> Ok, I know it's wild, but I dress my dog in different outfits and stage photo shoots to make calendars. He is just too cute! <0> lol that sounds very fun, can image it being a good hobby.  What dog breed is your favorite? <1> Blue heeler. I want another one and my parents said they will get me one when I finish grad school. I am in my last year. <0> Oh, that sounds hard though- dogs are quite difficult.
<0> Anytime the weather is sunny I feel happy. <1> wow,  its good to warm
<0> I have always dreamed of owning a Ferrari <1> Oh, luxury. It's an Italian sports car manufacturer in Maranello. <0> Oh yes. Do you know what kind of engine it has? <1> I'm not sure. But, it was founded by Enzo Ferrari back in 1939, and they built their first car in 1940 <0> Do they still make them or would I have to buy an older car? <1> It has been restructured back in 2015, making Ferrari N.V.

<0> Manta rays are kinda scary, I would be afraid to swim with them. <1> International Union for Conservation of Nature says that Mantas are endangered or vulnerable.  Tell that to Steve Irwin!! <0> Wasn't he killed by a sting ray ? What is the difference between the two ? <1> I don't really know, but it is hard to believe that the crocodile hunter has been dead for almost 11 years. <0> I thought it was longer, but yes the world lost a great guy. <1> What is equally unbelieve is that he went from being the owner of a zoo in Australia to being world renowned for his show, the Crocodile Hunter, which aired for 11 years. <0> That's what happens when you become famous, look at Gordon Ramsey, now he only does shows because he makes more than in restaurants. <1> His widow, Teri Irwin is a remarkable woman.  She met him at Australia zoo and fell in love, and stood by his side through all of the TV shows and has continued his work since his death
<0> I'm getting married next year! Hoping everything goes smoothly and we get the wedding we want to have. <1> That is so exciting! It can be stressful and expensive planning a wedding. <0> Boy are you right about that. I was really excited during the early planning stages,  but it's been stressful ever since. <1> It really gets stressful when you get down to the last minute. You are always so worried you are going to forget something.
<0> Last week I woke up to a really cute text from my girlfriend and a funny message from my brother. <1> That's lovely! I love waking up to awesome texts. <0> Yeah! I had a moment of realizing how lucky I am to be in the position I find myself in,  and felt really thankful for my life and the people a part of it. <1> That's so wonderful to hear. <0> You must be really proud of people around you for early morning text
<0> Do you listen to jazz music? It originated in the African American communities, but is enjoyed by many cultures. <1> I heard that it was a cross  of african american and european american styles.  How long has jazz been around? <0> Since the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It's been around for a long time. <1> When i go to New Orleans, they have bands roaming the streets.  Is that Jazz and why do they play jazz there, besides it being old fashioned? <0> It is because that is actually where jazz originated, in the black communities of New Orleans.  <1> OK. isn't Jazz related to the 1800's slang term Jasm, meaning pep or energy?

<0> Garth Brooks was always one of my favorites, but I enjoy George Strait a lot as well. <1> My mom loved George Strait. In 2009, country music was the most listened to music during rush hour. It's what I always tune in to while sitting in traffic. <0> Ye my mom was never a big  <1> Was never a big what? was that a typo? common mistake haha <0> haha ye i accidentally pressed enter. She was never a big garth brookes fan, always said i was dumpy for listening to him <1> I have always been an avid banjo player, country music has gotten me into it. I just enjoy listening to country music so much. <0> Oh that's awesome! I'm a big pianist, and I've got super long fingers so im quiet good at it haha! <1> I actually wanted to do it as a career but it never took off and now I have a crummy job at scrubway... <0> Aw that unfortunate. I heard scrubway has good benefits though
<0> I visited some historical sites in Utah last month. A lot of the prehistoric art was red. That's one of my favorite colors :) <1> Oh really? I like red too. I think my favorite shade is cherry red. <0> There's so many shades to choose from lol. I like all of them from pale red to dark red burgundy. I think my favorite is vermillion, though. <1> I've never heard of vermillion. Is that a dark or light red? <0> It is a very bright shade. Not too light and not too dark. A smidge lighter that Crayola red. <1> Ah okay. It would be cool to have a Ferrari made in that color. <0> It would!! I've always wanted a green sports car though. Large variety of shades of green too haha. I want an emerald colored car. <1> I've seen those green cars that change shades if you look at it from a different angle. Those are cool.
<0> I love jazz. I listen to it whilst working and studying. <1> Many people see Jazz music as "Americas classical music." <0> I can see why, so many popular Jazz musicians are from old US. <1> Well it has been recognized as a major form of musical expression since the 1920s
<0> Hi  <1> Hi, I was watching the movie Superman, the superhero that started off in comic books by DC Comics, do you like Superman? <0> yes, i love superman . He is the best hero of all time. <1> He was actually created by two high school students, Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster. That's a surprise, huh? <0> That's amazing . Their awesome.  <1> Yes, when they sold it to DC Comics in 1938, it was actually Detective Comics. Do you like DC Comics? <0> yes i do <1> Yes, the original creators tried to recover their rights back to Superman when he became so popular. I guess it didn't work huh? <0> Yeah, I guess it didn't!
<0> I need to lose some weight.  Obesity is a condition where excess body fat is stored in the body <1> It can be pretty hard to lose weight, but I know there are some good diets you can try.  Have you tried any diets? <0> I have tried some low carb diets that restrict carbohydrate consumption <1> Do the low carb diets have a name?  Is Atkins a low carb diet? <0> Yes, the Atkins diet is classified as a low carb diet, developed by Robert Atkins <1> Has that worked for you at all?
<0> I love to bake cakes. My wife married me because she loves my cakes so much. <1> Yes, we all love cooking food that uses prolonged dry heat. I can't do without sugar and banana muffins  <0> She jokes around that I'm The Cake Boss after the tv show.What's your favorite flavor of cake? <1> Ah, cake boss, that guy make us all wanna be like him :)  but all over the world, I realize that the most commonly baked item is bread <0> What type of bread is the most commonly baked? <1> Low sugar bread
<0> im nervous for the new week to begin <1> Is there something that is making you nervous about the upcoming week? <0> very busy and lots of traveling <1> That can be stressful. I am sure that every thing with go smoothly for you! Just remember that the weekend is only 5 days away!  <0> That is a very positive outlook. I just hope all my traveling goes fine.
<0> Wine tasting is truly amazing. There are so many different varieties. <1> Oh yes, the practice is ancient since the 14th century. It's slowly been refined over time <0> I especially love to learn about all the pairings as well. It makes the meal a lot better. <1> Yea. Wine tasting examines the wine using the senses and it helps to pair them correctly. Red and meat, for example (if you're into that) <0> I see. There are wine pairings for all flavors, sweet and savory. <1> Modern taste testers (the professional ones) use specialized terminology for the range of aromas, flavors, and characteristics as well <0> I cannot wait to until I have the opportunity to learn all about them. I bet California has the best wine tastings. <1> i was not interest in taste
<0> I believe in so many things but fully believe we should want a state of health and well being. I play many sports and believe in my physical fitness as a way of life! <1> Physical fitness is really important to me too. <0> I take it easy in though to not be overwhelmed, I say to myelf... it's going to be a good day, fitness is defined as the quality of being fit... and then do my 4 am routine :) <1> I prefer to work out at night, personally. <0> I like to get all ready to start the day and want to have morning routine done by 6.  When did you realize you were starting to become fit? Mine was when I could carry daily activities without fatigue. I looked in the mirror and BAM the body match the emotions <1> I took me like a month to see some results of lifting. <0> I just ask because I care, are you taking care of yourself with good eating habits too? You need proper nutrition if you do moderate-vigorous activities.  <1> Not really, I eat a good amount of junk but hey, if it fits your macros.
<0> My dog loves dog bisquits. I give them to her throughout the day. They are the hard and dry type.  <1> Awww! That's cute! Do you give them to her as a reward for doing something specific, like a trick? <0> When she was younger I did. Now it's more as a dietary supplement and a snack, like us humans.  <1> I'll bet she loves that! Do the bisquits have vitamins and other health benefits? <0> I am not sure, but, the biscuits are supposed to help clean the dog's teeth, promoting oral health.  <1> That's certainly an added benefit! It's very hard to brush a dog's teeth! Can you recommend a good brand of biscuits?
<0> My friend recently moved far away and I have really been missing her. <1> How far away is she ? <0> i used to be able to walk to her home, but i have to drive over an hour now <1> that's a long drive may be she miss you too <0> we have been friends for many years and have competed in 5k walks together <1> that is very impressive you should visit her.. <0> i hope my honda civic will make it to see her <1> drive safely dont overspeed in eager to see her <0> thank you.  i just found out that my boyfriend is flying her and i on a surprise trip together! <1> wow that's amazing ....have a nice trip and enjoy together <0> thank you.  do you like to walk for fun or health reasons? <1> I enjoy taking walks for exercise. However, I have never participated in a 5k walk. 
<0> I am so happy I haven't ahd to put my children in childcare or daycare and have someone else caring and supervising them. <1> Yes, I would always be nervous about what happens during the time away from my children. <0> I know that is how I felt, you never know what happens when nannies, babysitters, teachers or other providers are taking care of your children <1> Actual references from close friends would be the only way I would go with a babysitter <0> I would definitely be more inclined to go that route when choosing the perfect care giver for my kids. I would feel even better using an extended family member of my child <1> Absolutely.  It would be perfect to have a family member involved.  The extra pure love is key! <0> Very true, that is why I think it is best when parents or or legal guardians take care of their children, because they are they only ones that love the children <1> It is difficult for some who do not have the financial resources to stay home though.  Tough situation. <0> That is difficult and if you don't have resources for a quality daycare, it can really impact children's futures. I think people really disregard how important development is for young children <1> Yes, I think it is important to have a good parenting environment for kids!
<0> Are you from a different region than those people?  <1> Yeah. I'm from Florida in the US, but my grammer, semantics and dialect seem no different to me than those of my friends elsewhere. <0> I've never been to Florida, but I hear that the weather is always nice.
<0> i am single as well . i am trying to get better at piano to impress them . <1> i can't concentrate too . . . always daydreaming at work <0> What do you do for work? <1> i work to . but i daydream so much that i forget sometimes that i've a job <0> I don't daydream so much, <1> I don't believe we are supposed to remember our dreams so don't feel too bad. Scientists don't even fully understand the purpose of why we have dreams. <0> What do you dream about? <1> When I sleep, I dream about alot of weird stuff... mostly about my fears becoming a reality. What about you? <0> I never remember my dreams. It's been years. <1> Oh, I see. Well that is interesting. What do you do for a living? <0> My day job is retail, but I took an evening gig playing piano at a local restaurant. <1> Playing piano sounds neat, I don't know how to play any instruments.
<0> Do you enjoy any water sports like Kayaking? <1> I like some water sports including Kayaking but overall I prefer sports on land. <0> Personally I love Scuba Diving. Only done it once in my life but you never forget the experience.  <1> Where did you go scuba diving? was the introductory training difficult? <0> I Scuba Dived in the bahamas on vacation. No the training only took about an hour.  <1> Did you get a chance to do any cave diving? I'm not sure there are any caves in the Bahamas.
<0> good morning . how are you ? <1> i'm ok , drinking a lot of coffee , how about you ? <0> just relaxing waiting on my wife and three children to get ready . <1> where are you all going to ? <0> We are going to the local coffee shop!
<0> hi how are you doing ? i am fine thanks to the lord . <1> i am doing well , thanks . <0> my favorites are music and i love playing video games and you . <1> i prefer to workout . it helps me with my career as a pro wrestler . <0> that's great good for you . i like to wear skinny jeans . <1> i find those very uncomfortable , they would make it hard to move around . <0> yes if to small i also like leggings they are comfortable . <1> i like wearing leggings when i'm volunteering at the homeless shelter downtown . <0> that sounds very comfortable . i like wearing ruffle shirts too . <1> Ruffle shirts and skinny jeans is such a good look to me.
<0> I guess i'm not interested in a particular topic. I've just recently become curious and wanted to know more so your choice I guess. <1> I see! Well my favorite type is sports jornalism. They cover the world of sports and might work for a newspaper company! <0> Oh really? I use to be a newspaper reporter! I am retired now. But I really enjoyed the work. <1> What type of stories did you cover? <0> Mostly local things. The local highschool football games were my favorite thing to cover. <1> I think I would be fun to cover travel and exotic locations! <0> Yea, I dont like to travel much. I much prefer staying close to home. <1> I've always enjoy traveling.  My job as a chef has allowed me to move around a bit.  It's an adventure. <0> Oh what an interesting career! I dont enjoy cooking that much but I would love to taste your creations! Love to eat! <1> I don't like fussy stuff.  I like making the kinds of foods that make people happy.  What's your favorite food? <0> Im pretty simple. Juicy steak, mashed garlic potatoes and salad. If the steak is cooked right it doesnt need any sauce or toppings. <1> A good steak is the best.  I like mine medium, you?
<0> Yeah, sometimes I go to the gym to use special equipment <1> you can use dumbbells or weight stacks in order to oppose the force generated by muscle. <0> I listen to music when I'm at the gym, but when I'm home I like to read <1> When i am at home i like to eat large healthy servings and cardio to burn the calories <0> What do you like to eat? <1> I love some salad! But i also eat alot of un-necessary junk food. Fish and chicken I can live on <0> I can eat literal boatloads of brussel sprouts <1> I have tried brussel sprouts, they are not my favorite! I am more of a broccoli, carrot type of person <0> I love to cook! But boy do they stink up the house! <1> Too funny, I agree! What about exercising?  <0> Ah, nevermind that, I'd rather read comics and eat sprouts. <1> I have read a few comics! What would you recommend?
<0> I got a job interview for a very prestigious company.  I spent weeks studying and researching them then had my interview this morning. <1> Great! you must be well prepared. Are you nervous? <0> No actually I was feeling very positive as I had done so much research.  During the interview I was able to answer the questions with ease and my courage just grew and grew.  I left feeling on top of the world as it had gone so well!
<0> I like the color red. It's the color at the end of the visible spectrum of light.  <1> Yes red is a nice color! Red is one of the colors in RGB color model! <0> Whoa! Interesting! I've heard that it has a wavelength of approximately 625-740 nanometers. <1> Neat! It is interesting how the sky turns partly red at sunset. <0> I've heard it has something to do with some sort of Rayleigh scattering. I wonder what causes the red color of the Grand Canyon.  <1> Wow! I don't know, but the Grand Canyon is magnificent! Red is also a great color for clothing. I like red ties. <0> Back in the Renaissance days, the red costumes were dyed with kermes and cochineal. <1> Interesting! I wonder why? Red has interesting associations under different cultures.
<0> I feel very strange for not feeling any remorse about anything really. <1> Maybe you haven't done anything terribly wrong that anyone would feel remorseful about. Do you think that's it? <0> I think it might just be a stage in life. <1> Maybe. It's none of my business but sometimes when people feel this way,  they could be experiencing depression.  <0> Maybe it's time that I see a doctor.
<0> hello . how are you tonight ? i am doing great . <1> hi ! just enjoying the sun during vacation . i am at miami beach . <0> i would love to take my wife and kids to the beach . <1> i am on a school trip . brought some 4th graders . i am their teacher . <0> how many 9 year olds do you have with you ? my youngest is 9 . <1> 10 . after a swim , we are going to play monopoly . board games are the best ! <0> are you the only adult there ? <1> my parents are helping , too . they used to teach . <0> so you are not really on vacation .
<0> I love to read fiction how about you? <1> yes i love the classification for any story or setting that is derived from imagination of the author! <0> Yeah some are really good! do you have a favorite? <1> i enjoy gothic fiction, which is largely known by the subgenre of gothic horror, is a genre or mode of literature and film that combines fiction and horror or death <0> Yeah like lovecraft? <1> well something like Horace Walpole would write such as the 1974 novel The castle of Otranto - A Gothic Story <0> That is really cool! <1> yes and Horace is actually an English Art historian, a man of letters and a antiquarian 
<0> I tell my best friend everything, even deep dark secrets.  <1> It must be nice to be close to someone like that. <0> It really is. I never had a close friend like David until I joined the ballet company that we dance in together. <1> My best friend dies several years ago from cancer. I really miss talking to her.
<0> Are you from a different region than those people?  <1> Yeah. I'm from Florida in the US, but my grammer, semantics and dialect seem no different to me than those of my friends elsewhere. <0> I've never been to Florida, but I hear that the weather is always nice. <1> The weather is lovely! I love hot weather. <0> Speaking of hot, I recently traveled to Texas. Between all the Spanish and the southern accent, I had a hard time keeping up. <1> We do have thick accents, but our food is amazing. <0> I heard good things about the fried conch in Florida. I'm not normally a seafood fan, but I am a deep fried food fan. <1> I love seafood, but I've never had a fried conch. <0> What about gator? I'm not a very adventurous eater; I don't know if I would be brave enough to try it myself. <1> Negative. I'm a very picky eater. I like fish and shrimp. <0> I know Florida is known for oranges, but I recently learned that it is also a big producer of strawberries. Are they better or cheaper there? <1> I personally think they are better, though not necessarily cheaper. <0> Still . . . nice weather, great food . . . sounds like a great place for a visit. <1> It is. But the food is not quite as good as what they have in Texas.
<0> Yes and I hear some can have 8 strings. But those are really hard to play, Do you have any favorite guitar songs?  <1> I have two types of guitars. I have a hollow wooden one for acoustic and I also have an electric one. The electric guitar is my favorite. <0> My Father played the guitar, but he is having some health problems right now. <1> I'm sorry to hear that, hopefully he starts feeling better soon. How are you holding up? <0> I am doing ok. Thanks for asking. Playing guitar helps me cope. My father has a cool collection of guitars. <1> Nice, any particular songs you normally play? <0> I like to play mostly classic rock songs. What do you like better about electric guitar?
<0> 7 years is a long time , i'm not very satisfy with my job . <1> where do you work at <0> Oh its not very interesting, I prefer to not think about it outside of the time they pay me. <1> Have you ever thought about looking for something that you would enjoy more?  <0> Do you enjoy your job? <1> Yes. it's a good time.  <0> Do you have any hobbies and interests? <1> I could sit on a beach all day.  <0> I’d like that too, as long as i could keep up with what was going on in the world. <1> There are always ways to keep in touch with the world.  <0> Do you enjoy listening to the news? <1> No, I prefer to not worry about it.
<0> got dumped for being selfish i need to change <1> you don't need to change for anyone . <0> I want to change though. I know I can be selfish at times, and weak. <1> how were you being "Selfish" <0> I put my needs ahead of my boyfriend's and now my heart is broken :( <1> well things take time i wouldnt say change youll find someone that loves you for you <0> I appreciate the kind words, thank you. I still feel motivated to change and I hope I can over time
<0> I love pasta! It is a staple food of traditional Italian cuisine, <1> I also love pasta!  Angel Hair is my favorite!  How about you! <0> I like Angel hair too! I learned in school that their are two kinds of pasta dried ("pasta secca") and fresh ("pasta fresca"). <1> What is the difference between the two? <0> One is dried the other is fresh. Most dried pasta is commercially produced via an extrusion process today/ <1> What is an extrusion process?  I am unfamiliar with that term? <0> It means that a machine is used to make it. I perfer fresh pasta since Fresh pasta was traditionally produced by hand <1> I prefer fresh as well.  I suppose fresh would be used at fancy eateries, right?
<0> what is wrong ? are the teachers bullying you ? <1> no but the kids at my school are . i am in high school and worry about money <0> Why dont you do some partime job? <1> I do work part time for a little money <0> where do you work? <1> I work at the grocery store <0> how are your studies going on <1> pretty good, as long as I do my assigned work I do well <0> good to hear you should do good in studies so next you settle in good job
<0> I have quite a lot of energy, but I know some people just aren't as lucky. Is their a medical condition for being constantly tired? <1> I think it's called Chronic Fatigue Syndrom, or CFS.  I don't know a lot about it, but it makes people tired for long-term amounts of time. <0> That must be awful. I wonder what causes it. Depression perhaps? <1> I don't think the cause is fully understood.  It could be genetic, could be biological, or it could be psychological. <0> Well, I guess the medical profession had better get to the bottom of it. It must be destroying people's lives! <1> Yeah, I hear its nearly impossible to keep up with daily routines when you have it.
<0> I saw a dog running earlier,  it was insane how fast she went! <1> Do you know what kind of dog?
<0> Are you into physical fitness? I play league tennis a couple of days a week to try and stay fit. <1> I am not into fitness. I don't have time for it mostly. <0> It does take a lot of time. This is why I love tennis. I get to participate in an activity that I enjoy and exercise at the same time! lol <1> I've been to 24 hour fitness a few times, it is a privately owned and operated fitness center chain. <0> Did you enjoy it there? How were the trainers? I've never found them very helpful unless you paid for a personal trainer. <1> Yes, they currently have 400 clubs <0> Wow! That is as large franchise! I am not much of a gym person. I tend to quit. Tennis is really the only activity that I find I can maintain. <1> Its important to get not only physical exercise, but proper nutrition as well to be physically fit.
<0> I just turned in my dissertation. I'm scared it will not pass and all my work toward my masters will be for nothing. <1> You only get to do it once?
<0> I came home from work,  expecting an empty apartment. My boyfriend was home from his trip a day early! <1> Was he alone?
<0> hi how are you doing today <1> i'm doing good you ? just getting ready for tomorrow . <0> is it a big day for you ? <1> not really , i stay at home with the kids , while my wife works . lol <0> that sound nice that you get to be with your kids <1> yes . i worked 10 years in human services , but my wife missed work . <0> that is nice that you can take turns with the kids . where do you live ? <1> i live in canada . yeah , she deserved the break . she works with my dad . <0> nice , in the city ? i live in the country <1> more so , i'm close to the city . lol . whats your favorite movie ? <0> die hard , how about you ? <1> Catch me if you can. Do you ever visit the city?
<0> I went to a baseball game with my favorite team a few weeks ago. They had been doing pretty badly in the first half. Somehow they managed to pull it together and win in the end! That made me very happy! <1> That's awesome! Sometimes pulling through a tough battle is more satisfying than just winning outright! Shows perseverance and a "never give up" attitude. <0> I agree, perseverance si a key human motivator. It can turn the outcome and can potentially make the underdo the winner.  <1> I know a lot of people root for the underdog, but I prefer games where there is no clear favorite. Fair, even, matches are more interesting to watch. <0> I tend to agree,a fair even match is just the right kinda match, like a perfect suspense movie. <1> I hope the Superbowl this year is an even match, some of the past years have been disappointing. <0> Oh yeah, nothing against the patriots but the superbowl has gotten a bit boring seeing them numerous times. I need some fresh teams. <1> Remember a few years back when the Colts played the Bears? Disappointing game but awesome half-time show - my favorite artist played. <0>  i feel like superbowl is trying to attract more people to the game, by having an attractive half time show , along with non football related things. <1> I think Jennifer Lopez and Shakira are playing the show this year. <0> that is cool, i will be checking it out for sure, now we need a good game.  <1> Any predictions on who might be playing?
<0> hello , how are you tonight ? <1> i am fine thank you <0> what do you do for a living ? <1> i sing folk music for a living <0> nice ! i am a part time piano teacher . <1> i am a custodian to put bread on the table <0> nothing wrong with that , i am a volunteer at a shelter for women . <1> my parents don't support me in my pursuit in becoming a singer <0> my father is a concert violinist . he's supportive of me . <1> you are very lucky then <0> i am , maybe one day your parents will change their minds . <1> hopefully not you don't want that <0> i don't want what ? <1> I thought you said your parents want to change their mind.
<0> Remember when we were young and could run through the fields of flowers? I miss it. <1> Yeah,  those were better times. Brings back good memories. <0> Maybe we can relive such times through our children. <1> Well,  maybe yours. Mine just want to sit inside and play on their phones all day. <0> Yea, mine too.
<0> I love it when the buildbuilding is comingfrom me <1> That's awesome,  I wish I could build my own house.
<0> I am scared of spiders! <1> All spiders or just the poisonous ones?
<0> My ex boyfriend and I started having trouble getting along and we were under a lot of stress over money.   After awhile of this he started putting a password on his cell phone so I couldnt get in to see his messages.  THat was the first sign! <1> Wao, thats really not cool <0> NO,  not cool at all.  We ended up breaking up for a bit and he didnt waste any time before seeing this girl.   I wasted four years of my life for that to happen.    <1> He doesnt deserve you, so wipe your tears <0> Thank you for your kind words!
<0> I give my dog two dog biscuits when he is a good boy. <1> Aww! That's cute! And actually, you're doing something good for his health! Dry, hard dog biscuits can help clean a dog's teeth! <0> That what I have heard and he just loves them! <1> I'll bet! Dogs seem to like dog biscuits like humans love snack food! I know I'd be happy if someone handed me snack food a few times a day! Ha! <0> Same! Do you know what the treats are made of? <1> I think that a lot of dog treats are made with flour.
<0> So I got a new job recently,  and I got my first paycheck and it was pretty good compared to what I was expecting! <1> Nice,  congratulations. How are you liking the new job itself?
<0> Near my house,  there is an abandoned school that is said to be haunted. When I was a teenager,  a group of friends and I decided to go check it out. <1> Oh wow,  what happened? <0> When we pulled up,  it was very spooky. I didn't even want to get out of the car!

<0> We had circus in the area last week.  I am not a fan of the clowns. Are you?  <1> Clowns are very interesting and oftentimes come with different costumes and performances. I enjoy them. <0> the comedy style of clowns , playing the fool, has a long history in many countries.  <1> They have a pretty rich history. These comic performers often use slapstick methods for laughs <0> I like jesters and clowns a lot!

That sounds so delicious  <1> Yes it is very tastey, I eat alot of pizza during work. <0> What type of pizza do you like the most? <1> I really enjoy deep dish, but normal pizza has its place. <0> It's been a while since I've had any pizza, but talking about it makes me want to order some! <1> Yes you should, Just the other day  me and my brothers ordered some for the game. <0> What game were you guys watching? <1> We were watching Worlds for League Of Legends video game, but both of them dont play as much. <0> That sounds like fun <1> It is fun and exciting to watch, especially if you play the game. You can learn alot from watching it.

What colour are you thinking of changing it to? <0> I like my hair , but friends are doing it so I want to fit in. <1> It's very popular - 75%of women and 18% of men now colour their hair! <0> Maybe I just need to cover the gray with a light brown color. <1> It's very popular to cover grey hair with hair colouring

<0> I have CFS, is a medical condition characterized by long-term fatigue and other symptoms  <1> I'm sorry to hear that! Is there any treatment for CFS? <0> Not really it can be troublesome .  fatigue is not due to strenuous ongoing exertion, is not much relieved by rest, <1> That doesn't sound like much fun! What causes CFS? <0> It is chronic fatigue syndrome. No medications or procedures have been approved  <1> Is it genetic, viral or does someone just develop the condition out of the blue? <0> It is unknown what causes it. Evidence suggests that cognitive behavioral therapy and a gradual increase in activity <1> Well I guess that's some kind of hope for you! What else can you tell me about chronic fatigue syndrome?
<0> hello , how are you tonight ? <1> ok . just enjoying my television watching time . wishing i had someone to watch with . <0> i know the feeling . my husband is out of town and i'm home alone . <1> i wish i had a husband instead of being alone when i do my work at home . <0> do you date ? volunteer somewhere ? i met mine doing volunteer work . <1> i guess it is because i don't have time with the gym , work , tv , and cars . <0> what is your favorite food ? mine is cheeseburgers . <1> i love pizza , but i really enjoy putting my cash into the cars i've . <0> what are you building ? my dad built my mustang . <1> i am not really building . just love to spend money on buying them . <0> that's cool too . my husband has a raptor that he is putting money in . <1> maybe i should spend more money on trying to take a date out to a nice restaurant . <0> you really should ! girls like cars too , you know . <1> yes . you think i'd meet someone at the gym .
<0> She dressed all in white, refused to leave her bedroom, and only sold 18 poems while she was alive, out of 1800 that she wrote.  This is the textbook definition of a hermit or recluse. <1> What made her so crazy though? Was it where she was raised, in Amherst, Massachusetts? <0> I'm not entirely sure. <1> I'm not the least bit surprised, since she was considered a bit of an eccentric by her neighbors. <0> Anyone who is a hermit or recluse would be considered eccentric. A lot of creative people are as well <1> That's true. Anyone who marches to the beat of their own drum is often shunned. <0> When they should be welcomed and celebrated. Just because someone else's version of happy doesn't match our own doesn't make theirs wrong <1> That's totally right! In hindsight I'm sure people would have gotten to know her <0> I'm not so sure. Some things have progressed while others have not in my opinion <1> That is fair, I should have specified. Some people would have retrospectively been able to appreciate her work, had they known. She still wouldn't have appealed to everyone. <0> Hindsight is always 20/20

<0> really, why did you find it keen of discussing about others <1> It gives a sense of inclusion with the one I share it with. Just like "Casualty", British drama TV series portrays gossiping <0> I felt the need to inform others about the scandal and what was going on. I love to gossip, it keeps me on my toes <1> It is good to stay informed. <0> It is one of my quirks along with people saying I am OCD with staying organized all the time <1> it's not a bad thing to be organised, I have to be, I'm a carpenter <0> What an awesome field to be in, I believe you all are so gifted with your hands <1> I used to work in a pub, so glad i escaped to follow my dreams <0> I am sure you heard the gossip that I love to hear while working there <1> OF course I have. <0> I think since its raining today I will organize my closet, make use of my hands today like you.  <1> sounds like a good idea, it's horrible out there! <0> yea you are right
<0> mostly close with my brothers <1> i'm only child . and my companion is a cat . <0> yea but they moved away im in springfield mo so not much here <1> Im sorry.. I moved once from MD to FL so I know how you feel being without your peeps. <0> yeah i just bought a house here actually i love it its nice and peaceful but they wanted to move somewhere bigger <1> Thats awesome! I like smaller houses in my personal opinion. As long as there is plenty of sun shining through the windows. 
<0> i watch it on tv but playing is more fun <1> I agree.  Watching is enjoyable to see the experts, but playing is great for personal health and exercise.  Very little has changed in the rules of tennis since 1890.  <0> i like watching tennis than playing. <1> Sure. Most people don't have the physical stamina for playing tennis. Much easier to watch. <0> yes,but i would like to play it once or twice. <1> practice can always help . but i'm sure competition might be intimidated . <0> Especially that <1> Is it expensive to get into or can you play tennis on the cheap? <0> yes obviously.i like watching golf too

Hows your garden? <0> My garden is just lovely but this rain has been a real damper on it. <1>  I understand. I don't like bad weather either. It looks like rain here today too I hope not alot, I want to visit a roftop patio for drinks later! <0> Sounds like fun.  What do you like to do in your spare time? <1> Listening to music and playing board gameswith my cat. Like cavemen. Lol <0> lol now that's fun.  I like to swim and was a swimmer back in my college years. <1> oh you are a swimmer? me too! were you ever on a swim team? <0> Yes I was.  It was a great experience.  Were you on a swim team as well? <1> Yes, I had to shave my legs for more faster times!
<0> Every single time I go in the office bathroom someone comes in and needs something. If I don't go to the bathroom no one comes in all day. <1> how do you know no one goes in if you arent in there?
<0> I stepped in some dog poop walking in my neighborhood the other day. <1> That's disgusting, I would have a very hard time finishing that walk. Did you go straight home? <0> No, I went to my neighbor's house and wiped it on their porch <1> LOL! I bet your neighbors were happy to have such a beautiful edition to your neighborhood. <0> They better. I am sick of them waking me up in the morning. That's what they get <1> Ugh, that is inconsiderate of them. What do they do? <0> They are always up blasting music super early. I dont know why they cant just wear ear buds <1> That's stupid.  <0> Yeah. When do you usually wake up? <1> Usually around noon, so I can spend my afternoons watching tennis and golf on tv.  <0> That sounds relaxing! <1> Yeah, I try to avoid having a stressful lifestyle. How about you?

My favorite car is a Tesla. As for Vegatables, I really like Potatoes. <0> i love potatoes so much. especially fried <1> Same.. though I eat them in moderation so I can stay in shape. <0> do you drive a tesla? <1> I do not, I live in the city and most of my travel is done by bicycle.  <0> oh, which city? <1> I live in Portland. <0> i have always wanted to go there so bad <1> It lives up to the hype! Moved here a couple years ago and have loved it! <0> Is there lots of bike paths there?
<0> HI, are you interested in physical fitness, not just working out but good nutrition and proper rest? <1> I am interested! I have had trouble sleeping recently. <0> Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. A lot of things can cause insomnia, including stress, health conditions, or even just caffeine.  Are you doing anything to manage that? <1> I don't drink nearly as much caffeine as I used too. I cut out coffee almost completely. <0> It's hard to cut out caffeine! It's the most consumed psychoactive drug in the world! <1> Oh yeah trust me I know. I was drinking two pots of coffee a day. <0> Wow! I have to admit I have a problem with caffeine myself. I love coffee hot in the morning, then I switch to iced coffee later in the day.   <1> I do the same thing! I love some whipped cream on my coffee in the morning.
<0> I love science fiction movies about extraterrestrial and alien invasion <1> They certainly seem interesting though I don't watch them often, do you have a favorite science fiction movie in particular? <0> "War of the Worlds" written by H G Wells and starring Tom Cruise is a favorite! <1> Oh I think I've heard of it, I'm pretty sure it's famous. Around what time did that movie come out? <0> Not sure? Another good one is Invasion of the Body Snatchers from 1959 <1> That certainly has an interesting title, it must have interesting special effects since it's so old. Do you know what the plot of War of the Worlds is? <0> War of the Worlds was about aliens invading earth and exterminating humans to take the planet <1> Well that makes sense, the title certainly would imply something like that I suppose. Tom Cruise is quite an interesting actor and person, do you know much about scientology? <0> No, I don't really know anything about Scientology. 
<0> Thats pretty awesome!  How do you like living in Britain?  Do you get to see the Royal Ballet often? <1> I do! My wife and I go there often because we enjoy the artistic value it has, as it's one of the foremost ballet companies of the 20th century. <0> My mother used to say that ballet is in my blood. I never pursued it though. <1> You should always go with your heart. <0> You are right. That is why I paint portraits. What do you do? <1> I'm retired. I'm into motorcycles though. Always wear my leather vest and boots. <0> That is so cool. I am in my 20s but I am scared of motorcycles. <1> Yea.They require extra caution when riding on the road <0> Of course. How long do you have your motorcycle? <1> I've had motorcycles for over 30 years. They are definitely a passion of mine.

<0> I don't have a job currently. So today, I robbed an old lady. I feel bad about it. <1> Wow, that's really extreme. You should feel bad about it. <0> I know but I was desperate. <1> I mean, I get desperate times, but is there not a church or something in your area you could have turned to for help? <0> Well, I did. they told me that they won't pay me to travel to Nashville. <1> Why do you need to travel to Nashville? <0> One of my dreams is to become a country music star. <1> That's cool.

That sounds interesting though
<0>  No matter who comes to the door,  my dog barks. <1> Its a good guard dog then <0> In a way yes,  but not really.

<0> I like baked food <1> Eating baked food is great, baking it is great fun too. <0> I love pies <1> Pies are a great baked good, but there are lots of different things you can bake. Cooking food that uses prolonged dry heat is what baking is. <0> Really? <1> Baking is boring

<0> Looking for a new job can be stressful.  <1> It certainly can. What type of job are you looking for? <0> Well I went on 4 interviews to work in a clinic and all went well,  but they have not called me back and its been a week now.  <1> Maybe they had lots of other candidates to see <0> Yeah,  but bills are coming up so its making me very worried and nervous.

<0> Jazz is considered by many to be Americas classical music. <1> It can be soothing for sure..do you like jazz <0> I do because it has swing and blue notes and smooth vocals. <1> It is great music to just sit and relax too <0> It is and has roots in West African cultural and musical expression. <1> Yes, I did know that the history went way back and deep rooted <0> I thinks most popular in New Orleans because that where it originated.  <1> really I wouldn't know cause I can't stand jazz music.

What highlight colors would go good with dark brown hair? <1> I think blond would look pretty good. <0> I'll have to give that a try!

<0> I usually hate to ask for help,  so when my friends all surprised me by taking turns bringing us meals for 2 weeks after my 4th child was born I was blown away. I was so relieved to have help.  <1> Wow,  4 children my first is on the way and I'm freaking out. You must have great friends.   <0> That is so exciting,  congratulations! We moved 17 hours away from family,  so having a great group of friends is really important to us.  <1> Thank You. That is our next step we are moving from NYC to Miami after the baby. How can we find friends like yours? 
<0> Had a great weekend out on the lake! <1> That's really swell! What lake did you go to? <0> We went to the lake down the street. <1> Oh nice did you have fun? What lake? <0> I did have fun. I always forget the name of it. <1> i would like to get to the lake, work has been busy lately! <0> I know what that is like. Sometimes I get a lot of work. <1> I work with french fries all day, i think i might change jobs...lol <0> Where do you work that requires you to work with french fries?
<0> I like jazz music <1> YES I LIKE IT. JAZZ IS A MUSIC GENRE THAT ORIGINATED IN AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITIES. <0> Really? <1> YES.ITS DEVELOPED FROM ROOTS IN BLUES AND RAGTIME <0> I like blues <1> REALLY, BLUES IS A RHYTHM AND BLUE AND ROCK AND ROLL. <0> I didn't know that. I'd like to buy some blues music that also had a jazz flavor.
<0> I remember back when I started college. I moved to a new state where I didn't know anyone and I had no idea what to expect. <1> Wow that sounds scary. Did you make good friends? <0> Yes,  I did eventually. There's something to be said for living in a dorm at a time when you want to meet new people and fit in. <1> Yes it can be really helpful! I went to school 3 hours from my home and it was still hard to meet new people <0> Were you able to make many friends there?

<0> Hey! My faoirte color is red - the kind of red you'd see in a strawberry. <1> Red used to be my favorite color, but I am much more partial to green now. <0> fun fact: the color red is at the end of the visible spectrum? It is next to orange and opposite violet. <1> That makes sense, I think the other two are primary colors are blue and green. <0> Yep, you are right. It is a primary color and the complimentary color of cyan. <1> Cyan is a blue green though isn't it? <0> Actually, it is a greenish-blue <1> Is there a difference between those two/? <0> It may seem a bit complicated in distinguishing the hue, but it all comes down to the saturation and luminosity of the object that is being described. <1> Oh, wow. I never knew that about cyan. Thats interesting. 
<0> I just finished my last exam and am very relieved to be finished! <1> Congrats! That is always a great feeling. <0> Thank you! I'm ready to stop fixing cars and starting to office work. <1> I can imagine! Seems like that would be hard on the body. What kind of office work will you be doing? <0> My degree is in Marketing so I'll be looking for jobs in advertising mostly. <1> Oh that's great. Marketing is very lucrative! <0> It should be. What do you do?  <1> I used to be in a band, and with that we did a lot of social media marketing - but I don't do a lot anymore. <0> What kind of band?  <1> Hard rock! Can't live a day without it <0> Me either. What are you listening to these days? <1> Asking alexandria, hellyeah, motionless in white, five finger death punch, highly suspect (can't wait for their new album), in this moment, halestorm. you? <0> I've been revisiting Every Time I Die's early discography lately. My dog is wildly unhappy about it.

<0> I felt so bad when I got home from work because I saw a huge mustard stain on my shirt! <1> Aw that's the worst, especially when the clothes are new! <0> I agree. Do you know how to remove mustard stains? <1> Wash with cold water then use a white soap to wash it out in the sink. <0> Great! Thanks. Maybe I should stop eating food with mustard? <1> I would say same but I love mustard. <0> Me too. What other foods do you enjoy? <1> chicken <0> I love chicken! Especially on the holidays. <1> yeah, it the best with most things. <0> It adds so much flavor and is nutritious. Is chicken healthy to eat? <1> Some what  <0> I like to watch my weight, but it's hard. <1> Chicken has a lot of protien, but it can be high in calories depending on how you cook it.

Don't know what I would do without my music. It keeps me sane <0> I've looked into the Echo.. but kind of think I prefer the Google Home devices... just my personal preference, of course :) <1> That's cool. We're big on Amazon here.

I get so frusterated because there are no back roads to my house so I have to go through this for the next 2 weeks.  <1> That's unfortunate. I wish we could fly sometimes. <0> Yeah flying would be way better than waiting in traffic for 3 hours.

Heard of it? <1> I haven't, I've heard of one called The Comedy Store I think in California, but I might be getting the name wrong. <0> I think I've heard of that, so I think not. Well Carolines on Broadway is one of the most recognized stand-up comedy clubs in the whole US. <1> Oh interesting. Comedy clubs are great, it gives aspiring comedians a chance to practice their skills. Are you familiar with Joe Rogan? <0> Yeah, he's a little arrogant and rude but I like what I've seen of him. Tons of people have performed at Carolines on Broadway, like Louis CK and Jerry Seinfeld. <1> Sounds like a place for the big stars.

We have brown recluse spiders in the area where I live. They have a tiny shape like a fiddle on their backs. <1> Scarry.

He's the King of Rock And Roll <1> Are you a fan of Elvis Presley?
<0> Ferrari is my favorite car company. They are an Italian sports car maker <1> Yeah those are some really beautiful cars. I will never be able to afford one lol. <0> Yes, me either. I think they are so expensive because in 2014, they were rated the world's most powerful brand <1> Yeah and I believe they are hand built. A lot of man hours go into a Ferrari. What is the fastest they can go? <0> Not sure about fastest as it varies with each car but in 2012, the 1962 GTO became the most expensive car in history. <1> Whoa, I didn't know that. Is it because it is so rare?
<0> My girlfriend recently found herself a new hobby in sewing <1> oh thats cool,  is she good ? <0> She's super talented. She made a few dresses and cosplay within a month.  <1> oh thats cool

<0> i wish i could lose weight, i'm so obese  <1> i have some excess body fat as well. so i feel you on that <0> i don't even know how i became so obese <1> i don't know your situation but obesity is most commonly caused by exessive food intake, lack of physical activity and even genetic susceptibility <0> i do workout but i think i overeat. I tend to eat a lot when i'm stressed <1> it's more common than you think. I feel like food is so comforting! I strongly advice you to see a professional and start losing weight because obesity increases the likelihood of type 2 diabetes, sleep apnea even certain types of cancers <0> that's really scary. thank you for the helpful info <1> changes to diet (maybe not eating a lot of junk food and sweets) and exercising are main treatments <0> i should definitely give up on sugar and chips <1> Yea.

Planes, helicopters and recently fpv quadcopters. <0> That sounds like a fun hobby. I paint airplanes and helicopters sometimes.  <1> Cool!  Wish I could paint!  I like music as well and am currently building a Cigar Box Guitar. <0> Anyone can paint! You should try it. Do you play the guitar? <1> I play some, mostly I make up my own tunes.  Not good at figuring out popular tunes to cover.
<0> I give my dog two dog biscuits when he is a good boy. <1> Aww! That's cute! And actually, you're doing something good for his health! Dry, hard dog biscuits can help clean a dog's teeth! <0> That what I have heard and he just loves them! <1> I'll bet! Dogs seem to like dog biscuits like humans love snack food! I know I'd be happy if someone handed me snack food a few times a day! Ha! <0> Same! Do you know what the treats are made of? <1> I think they're made mostly from bran. Way back in Roman times, dog treats were mentioned to be "dog's bread." It's hard to believe dog treats have been around for so long, isn't it? <0> yeah I had no idea they made them way back then <1> Spain jumped into the dog treat trend back in 1623. They called treats, pan de perro, which translates also to dog's bread. People have been pampering their pets for ages!
<0> Yeah, sometimes I go to the gym to use special equipment <1> you can use dumbbells or weight stacks in order to oppose the force generated by muscle. <0> I listen to music when I'm at the gym, but when I'm home I like to read <1> When i am at home i like to eat large healthy servings and cardio to burn the calories <0> It's important to feel the burn!

<0> I've always wanted to visit the Niagara Falls, especially the Horseshoe Falls, although the other two falls would be fun to see, too. <1> i have never visited Niagara but it would be a neat place to go <0> It really would. The largest falls, the Horseshoe Falls are right on the border between the US and Canada. <1> so the Horseshoe Fall is the most famous one? <0> Not sure if its the most famous, but the Horseshoe Falls is the most powerful one in the US and Canada. <1> interesting, it borders both the US and Canada <0> Yes, it does. The American Falls and the Bridal Veil Falls are entirely on the American side. <1> if I remember right, the falls are in Buffalo <0> They're North-northwest of Buffalo, between there and Toronto, Canada. <1> I think most of the monuments are in the USA and they are amazing!
<0> I spent 10 minutes looking for my car keys while my friends waited outside and they were in my pockets the whole time. My friends made sure i never forgot that moment haha <1> We all do stuff like that. At least you didn't lock them inside your car. Done that before!
<0> Uh oh. I'm in trouble now. <1> Why is it that you are in trouble? <0> I lost a really important document at work... telling my boss is going to be so embarrassing.
<0> People don't think enough about early child care.  Quaility care at a young age can have a big impact on the child's future success. <1> I agree my kids have been in daycare from 2 months and up and once my oldest got age 2 I changed her to a private christian academy education is so important.  <0> Typically children are taken care of by parents or siblings, but daycare is very popular in the U.S. <1> It became popular because of the fact parents have to go to work the rates are sky high as well.  <0> Oh yeah, day care is basically the term that describes that.  it's a service usually during specific hours for while the parents are at work. <1> You have a few that services 24 hour but rarely, I think tat's what come into play also in child care as you mentioned earlier where parents lack but some can't afford that fee or it doesn't fit their schedule. <0> It's really tough when people can't afford daycare, and they're left with the double burden of working to earn money, but are stuck with domestic labor too, like child raising. <1> It is and alot of them need that help and support but just don't have it I know here in Florida they offer child care assistance but I'm not sure about all over or in other states. 
<0> I ate the last slice of pizza that my husband was saving. Oops! <1> Well you must have really liked that pizza!! <0> Yeah I was starving, so what are your plans for tomorrow? <1> i work as a vet so no days off over here! <0> Yeah I can imagine you must be very busy.

<0> Are you into any super heroes? My favorite is Superman!  <1> Among superhero action figures my favorite is Batman. I admire him for his personality and righteousness <0> I just have a thing for Superman's outfit. I know that sounds weird but he's totally hot. <1> Speaking of hotness, i am much attracted to that fictional superhero Wonder Woman. That is what I call beauty <0> She is beautiful. I am in full agreement. Her and Superman would make a great looking couple! <1> Indeed. Superman with its success, has pretty much established its primacy into comic books and mostly is central <0> What else do you like about Superman? I feel like he is the epitome of the perfect superhero. That's why I am so fanatical about him. <1> Jerry Siegel who created Superman was very adventurous in giving this character such powers. None others can match to him <0> That's true. I feel like he would beat pretty much every other super hero out there. <1> ye he will

Ive been there more times than I can count, Im practically an expert on it now, Do you need to know anything before going? <0> Yes how is the tours I heard they are so awesome but very wet on the boat ride. <1> The tours are fantastic, The ferry boat takes you from the southern end of the Niagara Gorge. to the north side, you get to see and experience everything. <0> So it is a pretty long ride I'm getting excited just talking avout it I heard they are also known for  penguins, seals and sea lions will I get to see those on that ferry ride? <1> Im not really sure about penguins but ive seen some large fish in there and thats about it, The sea lions are way further out on the water and dont hang close to the falls.  <0> Maybe good to keep the se lions away lol, we plan to stay at a bed and breakfast to be so relaxing and to be near a local hiking trail, <1> When you go be sure to visit all the three waterfalls, Which are Horseshoe Falls, the American Falls and the wonderful Bridal Veil Falls. Hope you have fun! 
<0> I love wine tastings, what about you? <1> Personally, I am not much of a drinker; but I do know a little about wine tasting.  It has been around forever, it seems.  But the methodology of it today was really established around the 14th century.  Do you have a preference on wine? <0> I like red wines most of all but will try it all. I am not big on drinking either, though <1> The white wines have a long history, too.  The white wines have been around for nearly 2,500 years, and they are produced through the fermentation of non-colored pulps of grapes.  Do you ever use wine in your cooking? <0> I have never dabbled with wine in cooking but would like to <1> Yes; I actually replace the wine with white grape juice in my cooking.  Sparkling wine is another style of wine that is used basically with carbon dioxide.  It makes it all fizzy and fun!

It specialize in the  use of resistance to induce muscular contraction which builds the strength, anaerobic endurance, and size of skeletal muscles. <1> That's smart!  Do you have to do any extensive cardio exercises to keep up the toned body? <0> No I focus mainly on Weight training  which is the most common type of strength training for developing the strength and size of skeletal muscles. <1> I didn't even know our skeletal structure even had muscles to begin with.  I usually thought of them as separate.

<0> It is a shame how many people are obese nowadays. <1> I really feel for those obessed,is a medical condition in which excess body fat has accumulated to the extent that it may have a negative effect on health. <0> Do you know the percentage of people that are obese in America right now? <1> Well im not a statistician,but People are generally considered obese when their body mass index (BMI), a measurement obtained by dividing a person's weight by the square of the person's height, is over , with the range <0> Do you know the main causes of obesity? <1> Obesity is most commonly caused by a combination of excessive food intake, lack of physical activity, and genetic inherited <0> I wonder how many obese people could get better if they really worked towards it. <1>  Obesity and walking describes how the locomotion of walking differs between an obese individual and a non-obese individual and a non-obese individual 
<0> I used to have really blonde hair but now it is very brown, which makes sense since it's the 2nd most common human hair color. <1> I have naturally brown hair but had to much gray so I went blonde too. <0> Well my hair is brown now, or brunette as a lot of people call it. <1> Hair is just the pgmentation of the follicles due to two types of melanin, eumelanin and pheomelanin. <0> I know, this pigmentation is what determines darker or paler hair colors. <1> The hair color of mummies or buried bodies can change. That is why Egyptian mummies have reddish hair. the melanin breaks down when oxidized <0> That's oddly similar to iron rust. Speaking of this, hair color can often determine hair thickness, like red hair being the thinnest. <1> I had no idea that red hair was the thinnest or that color can determine thickness.

I know people who have had surgery and are quite happy with the results. <0> I think I might get a gym membership, On average, obese people have a greater energy expenditure than their normal counterparts so I will have to work hard <1> A gym membership is a great idea!

I am definitely more impulsive when I'm stressed out. <0> Me too, I just act on a whim when stressed sometimes. however even though stress can be horrible, sometimes it may be beneficial too, for example in competetive situations. <1> I agree.  Sometimes stress can help me be more motivated as well - if I have an upcoming deadline for example.   <0> It does play a role in motivation, as well as adaptation to the environment. I myself started thinking of stress as a more positive thing, in the past I used to only focus on the discomfort. <1> In what ways has it been positive in your life recently <0> Lately my wife and I have been apart for work related reasons, I decided to take on eudaimonic perspective, in psychology it's the concept of a "good life", living according to greatest values in life, and thought to myself the stress motivation can help me finish up working faster and come back to my wife while appreciating I have a job. <1> That must be tough - being away from each other for extended periods at a time.  My girlfriend and I had to spend two years apart while I studied abroad so I know the struggle.
<0> When my son was born it felt like I had everything I needed in life. <1> I bet that was a wonderful day <0> It really was,  my life finally felt complete. <1> I am very happy for you
<0> All I want in life this weekend is to sleep and I have to work.  <1> That’s a bummer. Drink some coffee <0> Coffee dose even phase me anymore. The lack of sleep is making my soul sad. <1> Try drinking a lot of water and cutting out soda
<0> Do you dye your hair - or change the color in any way? <1> Not at all, but I see a lot of people that do especially on my college campus. <0> The main reasons are cosmetic - to cover gray or to change to a more fashionable color - or even to correct bleaching by the sun <1> Most of the ones that I have seen are the girls that really like to dye their hair blue or red. <0> At home coloring has reached 1.9 billion and is expected to rise in the US <1> Really? That is a huge number of people! <0> I guess since it can be done by a hairdresser or at home, that at home is a lot cheaper. <1> Yeah people love to dye their hair blonde or black.
<0> I just dyed my hair blonde this afternoon. Do you like blondes? <1> Hair dying is the practice of changing hair color to look good <0> Well, they do say blondes have more fun like in the movie Legally Blonde. <1> Apparently the original Legally Blonde was a musical based on a book by Heather Hach <0> I love the movie, but I hate musicals. What's your favorite musical? <1> My favorite musical might be Grease. Great film that also includes a lot of hair dye and coloring. <0> Who's the main character in Grease? I've never seen it. <1> The film is about two high school seniors - one named Danny and the other named Sandy
<0> rock music is great while i am hiking ! <1> it does have a fast pace for anything physical . it was nice talking to you <0> how are you today? <1> doing good.. how about you <0> Im well. Just laying around being lazy.
<0> My cat disappeared,  we figure it died. <1> oooh,  sorry about that,  what happened <0> I was the last person to look after it when people were on vacation for about a week. I feel bad cause for a couple of those days I didn't crack the garage door. <1> sorry,  i hope you areokay now
<0> Bought a laptop I really needed last month. The price went down by $200. Wish I would have waited. <1> I hate when that happens! Were you able to get a credit for it? <0> no, by the time i bought it there was not that sale <1> that is too bad. <0> i know!! <1> I need my laptop for my job as a professional translator, so I understand. <0> well is the moment to buy one, the prices are good now <1> That is good to know, I will have to look.  <0> do not miss the opportunity
<0> I got accused of something at work today. <1> Im guessing it wasnt your fault? Do you know whos it was? <0> I wasn't even at work the day it happened,  yet they still insist it was me. <1> That sounds like sabotage to me. Is there any way to prove you werent there? I would be furious. <0> I really hated that day one of my worst days!
<0> Ugh! Tonight was such a bummer. <1> Oh no what happened? <0> I was going to go to a concert but couldn't get myself to go by myself at the last minute. I feel like I'm going to regret not going. <1> What concert was it? <0> It was an annual block party we have here with a local lineup of musicians. I really liked the lineup!
<0> hello, i do like red and it is my favorite color <1> Hi! Yes I love the red sky at sunset from Rayleigh scattering! I also love the grand canyon red. Do you? <0> so that what causes the color of red, the scattering <1> In the sky, yes. In general Red is the color at the end of the visible spectrum of light next to orange. <0> so red and orange are neighbors  :) <1> i hate the grand canyon.
<0> i couldnt stand it when my neighbor was using power tools at 8 am on a saturday <1> Wow,  that's super annoying! I understand wanting to get things done early,  but that's not very respectful to neighbors. <0> nope,  it was very frustrating,  he lives next door too <1> Have you talked to him about it? <0> No. It was to late in the day so I just dealt with it. 
<0> One time my friend said that I could tell him anything and she would snitch <1> Oh,  snitches are no fun. <0> Yes,  snitches get stiches <1> I would just keep to myself. <0> Yea that's standard rule
<0> its going well . spent the day outside . do you have any pets ? <1> no . . i have kids though <0> Those are way harder to deal with than pets. <1> Yes they are sometime, but they are useful right now. <0> How so? <1> I am in a wheel chair, so they help me get around town. <0> Oh yes, I'm sure they are very helpful right now.  Someday I will probably wish I got along with people better than animals. <1> You are not a social type of person? <0> Not really.  I find it hard to relate to people. <1> Some people are pretty cool when you start knowing them.
<0> Red the color at the end of the visible light spectrum looks good on everyone. Don't you think? <1> I am more of a fan of green.  That would leave us only one primary color: Blue. <0> But the dominant wavelength of red is approximately 625–740. That's impressive! <1> Hey, i have seen many a red sunset, and the wavelength you have mentioned is the reason. <0> I'm sure those sunsets were brilliant yellow-tinged scarlet and vermillion. The most beautiful red. <1> Ah yes, vermillion.  I like that almost as well as scarlet.
<0> Turns out it was a deer who got stuck in the bushes. <1> how on earth did it get stuck? <0> he must have got his antlers stuck in the branches <1> I've never seen a deer, I've spent my whole life living in the city <0> oh wow. we have deer all over my town <1> All we have are homeless people and gangs! <0> what city is it? <1> Buford, Wyoming! <0> oh wow i have never heard of that <1> It's west of Cheyenne. Booming metropolis! I recently decided to dye my hair pink to stand out in the crowds.  <0> i love colored hair. i just bought a blue wig <1> We should get together some time with our crazy hair!
<0> Is it terribleto always feel ok,  and not wait for the bad times <1> I suppose it is. <0> Than I will go on feeling this way I guess,  or do I have another option? <1> You always have options! <0> True. But what if I make the wrong choice?
<0> hi there . how is it going ? <1> hello ! how are you doing ? i'm doing pretty well today <0> i am doing great ! just got home from shopping . <1> where are you from ? i live in the us now but was born in africa . somalia <0> i live in north carolina . <1> nice . how is the weather there ? are you married ?
<0> fry it in sesame oil and garlic . wow i had a wierd dream last night . <1> what was your dream ? ? ? <0> I was doing laundry, and did not even blink at the fact that I had some pink bubble wrap socks. <1> Did they pop everytime you walked? <0> Nope, not at all.  And there was a kangaroo that delivered pot directly to your house.  Company was BounceBouncePuff. <1> That is seriously funny!  No wonder why you remembered your dream!   <0> They're hilarious!  I should write a book.  Always looking to make the benjamins. <1> Definitely write a book!  I wish I could do something fun, but I have a mortgage now so I have to have a steady income.   <0> You can dictate it into your phone and type it up later, or hire someone to transcribe it. Folks make good money doing side jobs like that. <1> Very true!  You should start it tonight!
<0> Do you like Jazz music? <1> I don't really know. I think I lack the musical expression to truly appreciate Jazz. <0> It isn't really my favorite type of music but I can listen to it for awhile.  what is your favorite type of music <1> I don't know for sure, but I tend to like music that emphasizes the vocal pieces.  <0> I honestly don't listen to much music.  I do like music from the 50's and 60's though. <1> Do you like the Beach Boys? They're from 1961. <0> Love the Beach Boys and the Beatles <1> Mike Love of the Beach Boys once said of their musical style: "Don't f%#$ with the formula." They must have known they had something good.
<0> I never can get myself to give away their baby items.  <1> You are telling me you are a hoarder? <0> lol no I just can't part with items that mean a lot to me like my kids baby things like first shirts ect. <1> Everyone is nostalgic one way or another.You are fine <0> Well they don't mean much to me so I'll be looking to get rid of them soon.

Not the dumb commercial trap rap, more introspective stuff
<0> Yesterday, I saw my best friend in the park. He was with my ex. <1> That's weird. Are they friends? <0> They were acquaintances, but I guess they are more now. <1> Is that u want to get back? <0> No, she can have him. <1> Cool Guy! <0> Yeah, definitely. I prefer the simple times. <1> Worthless to get back!, if you follow her <0> Yep, I think I'd rather stay home and watch the flinstones. <1> Lol!, u will get a better thing in it! <0> Yeah <1> i have never seen the flinstones! it is kind of Animation <0> It is <1> Is it worth watching? Maybe I should some time! 
<0> I spent some time with my middle daughter by taking her to ice cream. She is so sweet and lovely. We had a very special time.  <1> That's great that you had such a good time. You sound like a good parent! <0> I try to be! I do get distracted easily though, so I have to work more on always keeping my eye on them. <1> i understand. been there. done that. got the tshirt. i am an empty nester. <0> lol, congrats on that! I'm really dreading the teenage years. For now, I need to get more serious about school. <1> don't worry about the teenage years. just keep reminding them that you love them. wow! and you are going to school, too? <0> I am.

Gotta have faith! <1> once you complete it, it will be sssoooo worth it. hang in there. you got this. i am learning how to build websites myself. <0> Oh that sounds fun.

I think that would be great exercise. <0> my apartment complex has a tennis court and a few of my neighbors play
<0> I got into an argument with my husband and I realized later that he was right but I never apologized. :( <1> Maybe you should find him and apologize right now. <0> Yes maybe I should but my ego gets in the way. <1> You could just cook him a nice dinner or plan a special date instead. 
<0> Snoop Dogg better know as Cordozar Brodus,Jr was one of the best American rappers. <1> He is a gift to the world of Hip Hop <0> He started in the 90's and was discovered by Dr Dre <1> Yes, I don't see him sing much these days, is he retired? <0> That man sold a lot of records, It was like 23 million  in the united states alone <1> That's really impressive, like a gem in hip hop.
<0> I can't wait to have grandkids. IS that weird? <1> Not to me!  Some part of me is anxious to be holding a grandchild, and then when they poop or get fussy, to hand them riiiiiiight back to their parents! <0> Haha yes its just something about having the kids come up to new york for the weekend and being about to see them! but not for too long lol <1> I have a cruise planned next month, but I would love cooking for grandkids.  <0> where is the cruise to? <1> Bahama's. I've always wanted to see islands. The beauty of them amazes me,  <0> I would love to see the bahamas! sadly I've never been out of the county <1> Me either! I figured the next time I head to a tropic resort location on some island I'll give it a go and I did!  <0> Is there anywhere in particular you are looking forward to seeing?
<0> My dog Lola won first place in the dog show. That's my girl! <1> Awesome! What kind of dog is Lola? <0> She's a Pekingese. When they handed me the trophy I just couldn't stop smiling. She's the best dog I could ask for. <1> I don't think I would have been able to stop smiling either! That is so awesome! <0> I sure am glad you love cats the most just like me!
<0> My dog learned a new trick today! <1> Ooh,  what kind of trick did she learn?
<0> Do you listen to jazz music? It originated in the African American communities, but is enjoyed by many cultures. <1> I heard that it was a cross  of african american and european american styles.  How long has jazz been around? <0> Since the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It's been around for a long time. <1> When i go to New Orleans, they have bands roaming the streets.  Is that Jazz and why do they play jazz there, besides it being old fashioned? <0> Actually, jazz has been trending lately among the African American community. I love listening to it. For me it a new fashioned music.
<0> I knocked over a clothing display on the sidewalk outside of a boutique the other day when I was riding my bike. I should have gone back to pick it up but kept going. <1> I've done the same thing before. I'm sure you weren't a bother <0> I hope not. Now that you mention it I'm sure it happens all the time. <1> Yeah and they really should be better about how they place their racks <0> Exactly, If it wasn't in my way I wouldn't have ran into it.
<0> hello there ! what is your favorite thing to do ? <1> hi i love watching tv you ? <0> i do a lot of hiking around my native colorado . obviously not in the winter <1> that sound like alot of fun i go to the gym alot . <0> but in the spring and fall trooper and i go hiking . he is my black lab pup . <1> that's cool i love animals . <0> what do you do for a living ? mechanical engineering is my day job . <1> i do work at home on the phone . <0> what kind of car do you drive ? <1> i drive a bmw i like spending money on it . <0> i drive an isuzu rodeo 2001 . forest green . <1> that's cool i like green . <0> me too . what is your favorite gym activity ? <1> I like the rower machine.  Do you ever row in the outdoors?
<0> very awesome . my husband and i want to travel after he retires next year . <1> where do you want to visit ? <0> Our main bucket list item is to see the Northern Lights and after that, perhaps the Maldives. And retire somewhere in the mountains so we see snow every year. <1> Wow, that sounds awesome. Typically people want to get away from the cold in retirement, and here you are chasing it down. <0> One of us is originally from the Philippines and the other from the Deep South in USA, so we are both tired of the hot and humid weather lol <1> Haha, makes sense. I play jazz piano in a band, I may need to add the Maldives as a potential tour stop and see what the hype is about! <0> It's a beautiful island nation for sure. Jazz would sound great there! I love taking walks and listening to jazz actually. <1> That's awesome, it definitely soothes the soul! Would you say that it's your favorite genre? <0> For relaxing it would be my favorite genre of music. Although what I listen to most in general is classic rock. <1> Very cool. You mentioned one of you are from the Philippines, are you still able to speak the native tongue?  <0> Definitely, especially from my region of the Philippines. What's challenging is understanding Alabamian accents here, hehe. <1> Oh, I bet. French and Arabic are my second and third languages, and I can understand those better than accents in the deep south haha. <0> I can imagine! Wow that is quite a broad array of languages. I bet Arabic was quite challenging to learn. <1> yes it is and learning other language is fun too.
<0> This one year right after I moved to the east coast we had this scary hurricane warning. I went ahead and stocked up on all the basics; batteries,  canned goods,  beer. I was set! <1> How'd the hurricane go? <0> Wouldn't you know it totally missed my city. I was a little let down to be honest,  though glad we were safe. <1> Thank goodness. Hurricanes are no joke. <0> Yeah. I have been in several category 5 hurricanes before. They knock out the power for almost a week.
<0> That's interesting!  Do you ride horses? <1> yes i ride horses that are trained and ridden for practical working purposes such as in police work or for controlling herd animals or on a ranch <0> How long have you been doing that work? <1> I started out riding my mom when I was a wee lad.  <0> Lovely.  And you're very skilled at that? <1> I'm self taught actually. An hour everyday for a year now. <0> That sounds like a lot of hard work. <1> Yes it is depending on the individual horse. There is a tremendous amount of controversy over various training techniques. <0> Which training technique do you prefer? <1> I like to feed them carrots and ride around the track!
<0> I bought a bunch of dumbbells,  and a workout bench but I've barely used them. <1> I feel that pain. Do you not have the motivation or just dont know what to do? <0> I don't have the motivation. I know the workouts I should be doing but also struggle with proper form a bit. <1> I get that. Well if I could give any advice it would be make sure you have proper form over anything. Dont worry about heavy weight if your form is garbage. <0> Thanks for the advice! <1> No problem! Form is one of the most important parts of working out!
<0> I dislike a careless driver and this morning I was furious with one by my daughters elementary school.  <1> Oh I know how you feel! I wish there was some kind of hotline where you could report a license plate to law enforcement so they would get in trouble for being stupid with kids around <0> I wish to and the school zone light was flashing but they was driving past the 15 mph minimum a child could have got hurt. <1> Thats awful! People should be arrested for that <0> Yes! They did not go past speed limit by much, but with many kinds running around, arrest would be good, or at least get a ticket.
<0> hello . i'm trying to get photos of the moon . <1> i'm sorry , i cannot help you there . <0> not a fellow photographer then ? what do you do ? <1> no . i work in a shipyard . <0> cool ! i teach history to kiddos . we are doing christopher columbus . <1> that's cool , you must like kids . <0> i sure do . my boyfriend and i are moving in together next weekend . <1> how exciting ! i do not have time for a boyfriend , between my full time job and volunteering . <0> That's understandable, relationships aren't for everyone.
<0> i was so angry when a friend of mine made a pass at my girlfriend <1> That is no good dude
<0> I came home in my new mclaren to show it to my friend. <1> Whow! That is one mean car!   What did your friend say? <0> She was super excited and wanted to go for a ride immediately <1> Lucky you, I'm sure she was also impressed with you. <0>  I am married and she said my hubby must love me very much to get me that car <1> She's right, unless you paid for it yourself, lol. <0> I did not and would not. I gave him two children, so I deserve it. I drove up playing Charlie Daniels, who is my favorite. <1> Good for you and yes you do deserve it.  <0> What  is your favorite car  <1> I prefer the British sports cars, a Truimph TR-6, but also love the USA muscle cars of the 1960s Cobra, Dodge Charger <0> I would have my favorite musician Charlie Daniels playing with the wind blowing through my hair <1> Beautiful image. I love CD also. I'm a 60s/70s guy, even love playing the retro video games.
<0> Jazz is some of my favorite music, since it is so relaxing. <1> Jazz really is nice so soothing to listen to, its popular amoung african americans <0> That makes sense, since it is reminiscent of the blues. <1> Yep has deep roots in blues and ragtime <0> I thought so! I love the instruments that they use in jazz too. <1> Yea jazz music with a good saxophone is great <0> Saxophones are my favorite of all the instruments that they use, honestly. <1> I don't think I have a favorite instrument in jazz, but saxophone comes close.
<0> I am really afraid of clowns even though our modern clowns have been around since the 19th century. <1> I don't blame you!  Clowns are creepy!  Hence the movie "IT".  Why do people have such a fear of them though? <0> My fear is definitely from IT. Even though clowns are designed to entertain large audience <1> Where did clowns get there start?  Was it the circus? <0> Not sure but they go back to at least the 1800s when Joseph Grimaldi became the first mainstream clown <1> Wow!  I didn't realize they went back that far!  Who was Joseph Grimaldi and where was he from? <0> Well he was a part of the British Pantomimes and expanded the rowl of the clown in that. <1> Interesting.  I wouldn't have guessed a Brit was the first clown.  They have such dry humor!  Are there any other famous clowns? <0> Pierrot was a very popular pantomime as well. He performed unmasked with a large white blouse and wide white pantaloons <1> I actually hear of him he was amazing.
<0> I like red color <1> They say one can get that color in mars because of  iron oxide  <0> I am not too sure of that but I would say I love red cars and roses <1> my first car was a toyota camry and the red made it stand out everywhere I go. red is good on metallic surfaces ;) <0> i like red toyota camry sport versions  <1> Awesome, I wonder what it will be like if there was no red in the rainbow or there is no red sky at sunset :) <0> That is true. The rainbow will be incomplete without the red color. I also like red colors on cakes <1> Not forgetting blood is red too. That's to tell you how important the color is 
<0> Snoop Dogg is so awesome, he's a great rapper and does a lot for his community as well <1> He is awesome! Most people don't realize that his real name is Calvin Cordozar Broadus Jr. He is also a TV personality. Have you seen him live before? <0> I wish! I was too young to go to his concerts at the height of his popularity but I'm hoping one day I'll get to see him live. <1> I seen him a few years ago! It was awesome. He's sold over 23 million albums in the US alone.  <0> That doesn't surprise me. Didn't he change his name to Snoop Lion a few years ago? <1> Yes he did! I think he changed it back though. I love the song "Gin & Juice". Do you have a favorite? <0> I liked Gin & Juice and the one he did with Nate Dogg, I can't remember the name of it but it was funny. <1> I wish I could hear Snoop play live one day.
<0> I felt very sad recently when i found out that my mother has cancer  <1> Oh my gosh,  I am so sorry for your family.
<0> I have been feeling a little lonely lately  <1> I'm sorry to hear that! Maybe you can find a local club so you can meet people with similar interests! <0> What are you hobbies?
<0> i do in my spare time it rules <1> cool , i want to retire soon , how about you ? <0> not yet <1> This is my passion to retire in Hawaii after 10 years. I don't know why? <0> its looking good <1> I heard a lot about Hawaii but never visited the place. <0> i like hawaii and you <1> Never visited before but read a lot about it and heard about it from my friends. <0> yes, it is a beautiful place <1> Is living there expensive? <0> not really but average <1> What do you like exactly in Hawaii?
<0> My neighbor keeps letting her dog use the bathroom on her balcony. <1> That is just gross!  Have you spoken to her about it?
<0> Niagara Falls is one the most beautiful places i have ever been. <1> Oh yes it is but Ive only seen it in pictures. <0> It has three waterfalls that straddle the international border between Canada and the United States. <1> That is very interesting information. <0> The Horseshoe Falls is the mos impressive, it lies on the border of the United States and Canada with the American Falls entirely on the United States' side. <1> I really must go one day to see the beauty you speak of.
<0> I never feel more at peace than laying at my bed in the morning. <1> Sometimes I feel the same as you ... but I get up and move on <0> Some mornings my cat is on the bed, a little bundle of heat next to me. <1> My cat is usually sleeping on top of me in the morning.  I am always trying to move him without waking him up. <0> I do that also, but then he decides he wants his breakfast, and then it's hard to ignore him. <1> I really never have that problem as I do not have any pets.
<0> good afternoon . where are you chatting from today ? colorado here . <1> just here at my house in michigan with my boyfriend . <0> i have never been to michigan , but would like to hike there . do you like hiking ? <1> i love to go for walks . <0> i especially like going with my black lab , trooper . do you have any pets ? <1> no , just me and my boyfriend here . <0> what kind of work do you do ? mechanical engineer here .
<0> I have brown hair unlike my sister who is blonde <1> I also have a dark brown hair. Brown hair is actually the second most common color, of black being first. <0> yes.  it is strange - I wonder where red hair comes from <1> Brown hair is this shade due to having high levels of the dark pigment eumelanin, and lower levels of the light pigment pheomelanin. <0> Yes it is interesting how certain countries tend to have more of certain hair colors <1> True. Brown hair is more common in the Western World. Mainly in Europe, the US and some areas in the Greater Middle East.
<0> i used to take my children to disney world when they were young,  we always had a great time. <1> Family time is so precious. Are your kids still with you? <0> no they are grown.  they are in their twenties now,  i miss them. <1> They grow up so fast sometimes. <0> Yes they do, my wife is pregnant and about to born my first kids.
<0> I ordered a new phone last week,  and when the box got here it was empty. <1> That is so messed up! <0> Yeah,  I was pretty upset,  especially when they initially refuse to refund my money. <1> I would be so angry. <0> I will have to save for months to get another phone. 
<0> Hey man, I love listening to Snoop Dog. You know the American rapper and songwriter? <1> Oh yeah. He's great. I like almost all his songs <0> Yeah, I mean he sold over 23 million albums in the US alone. Do you have any of them? <1> I have Bush, it is really really good. His real name is Calvin Cordozar Broadus Jr. and is from Long Beach <0> Bush? Is that an album? I have "The Doggfather". I went double platinum in 1997. That one had some awesome tracks! <1> That's when he went back to being called Snoop Dogg. Its great to dance to. <0> For sure man. He ended up leaving Death Row Records after that and joined No Limit Records. He put out 3 good albums after that. <1> Wow,you must really know a lot about him

<0> drawing of ponies ? no real pets ? <1> nope my mom is allergic to anything with hair <0> I'm sorry to hear that, I can't imagine not having pets <1> yeah i would love to get a little yorkie <0> Yorkies are great, I'm more of a cat person myself though <1> I prefer dogs but I still like cats. how many do you have? <0> I only have one, it's a good companion but independent enough to take care of itself while I'm at work <1> cats are probably better for people who work away from home. i was watching someone's dog once and they refused to eat until their owner returned <0> That sounds stressful. I work long hours at a doctor's office so I can't have pets that require too much attention, unfortunately <1> cats are not probably better for people who work away from home. i was watching someone's dog once and they eat until their owner returned
<0> Wine tasting is truly amazing. There are so many different varieties. <1> Oh yes, the practice is ancient since the 14th century. It's slowly been refined over time <0> I especially love to learn about all the pairings as well. It makes the meal a lot better. <1> Yea. Wine tasting examines the wine using the senses and it helps to pair them correctly. Red and meat, for example (if you're into that) <0> I see. There are wine pairings for all flavors, sweet and savory. <1> Modern taste testers (the professional ones) use specialized terminology for the range of aromas, flavors, and characteristics as well
<0> I was waiting for a while for a video game to come out.  When it finally did it wasn't as great as I thought it was going to be. <1> That has happend to me too. <0> I got my hopes up too much. I should wait for reviews to come out before I rush out and buy next time. <1> You can always sell them if you buy discs. Cant do anything with a download though <0> That's very true.  Which is why I prefer physical discs most of the time.

<0> Obesity is such a huge medical issue right now. <1> Oh my goodness it really is, it is sad, I wonder how many people are struggling with it currently? <0> I hope not too many since obesity is linked to diabetes and sleep apnea and more. <1> That is sad, are there any ways to help reduce your risk, or help you through it <0> Eating less would definitely help, since obesity can cause even cancer. <1> I did not know that, what kind of cancer, I wonder?

Didn't know that. Learn something new everyday I guess. Hah <1> lol TRUTH!, I think the MAIN buzz is the fact he Hispanice by origin, born in Hawaii and raised in LA. crazy childhood. <0> That's crazy for sure. It must be nice to be born in Hawaii though. Don't think I'd ever be able to leave.  <1> Oh you would. I was stationed there in the Navy. Keep in mind it keeps filling with people and there is nowhere for them to expand to. <0> I don't think that's so bad. Eventually the main island could be like a little Manhattan with an ocean side paradise surrounding it. Could be kinda cool. <1> Beautiful place for sure don't get me wrong. Fun fact did you know that Bruno got his start as a song writer? 
<0> So this one time my grandmother gave me a scooter,  it was the best gift ever,  I was really happy <1> Thats sweet that you remember that,  how old were you?  <0> I was around 10 years old I think,  it was quite a long time ago for me now haha! <1> I wont make you reveal your age! lol :p  <0> I'm getting old and we stop caring anyways.

Jazz is a music genre that originated in the african-american communities <0> When did it originate? <1> Jazz originated in the late 19th century  <0> Are there different sub genres of Jazz? <1> Since Jazz just recently came about in the last few years it is too early to have sub genres.
<0> I cheated on a Spanish test in High school. <1> did you get caught <0> No, but I also didn't learn Spanish! <1> I did the same thing. It's too hard to learn at an older age. Especially when it's a mandatory school thing instead of an actual thing you WANT to learn. <0> And most highschool language teachers are utter garbage. The pace isn't fast enough and there's not enough immersion.

<0> Ive never been in one, sounds rough. <1> Neither have I really, but I have been seeking one for almost a year now. Romantic relationships seem hard though. <0> They really are, especially when you only like people taller than you <1> I still live with my parents so that may be a part of why I can't find a good partner! <0> Yeah, it's much easier to get to know someone when you have your own space and privacy.  <1> I hope I can get it sorted out. I think being single has taken a toll on my mental health. <0> Sure thing well good luck.

<0> my wife has brown hair, it's so pretty i really love it <1> Awww, that's so sweet! Brown hair is the second most common hair color after black hair. Mine is black :( <0> black hair is pretty too! i love natural colors, don't really like pink and green hair <1> Haha! Yeah, pink and green are a bit too crazy for me! If you don't mind me asking, is your wife European? I hear brown hair is pretty common there. <0> yes she is, she used to use Henna to dye her hair red. i mean it wasn't really red it just looked brown with red tint <1> That's pretty cool, I didn't know you could use Henna to dye hair. I always thought Henna was for drawing designs on your hands. <0> that's what i thought but apparently a lot of people from her home country (kazakhstan) use henna to dye hair. <1> That's pretty cool! I've heard there's all sorts of shades of brown hair. Does she have light brown or darker brown hair?
<0> I believe in so many things but fully believe we should want a state of health and well being. I play many sports and believe in my physical fitness as a way of life! <1> Physical fitness is really important to me too. <0> I take it easy in though to not be overwhelmed, I say to myelf... it's going to be a good day, fitness is defined as the quality of being fit... and then do my 4 am routine :) <1> I prefer to work out at night, personally. <0> Me too, nothing like burning the midnight oil with a good sweat.
<0> My dog loves dog bisquits. I give them to her throughout the day. They are the hard and dry type.  <1> Awww! That's cute! Do you give them to her as a reward for doing something specific, like a trick? <0> When she was younger I did. Now it's more as a dietary supplement and a snack, like us humans.  <1> I'll bet she loves that! Do the bisquits have vitamins and other health benefits? <0> I am not sure, but, the biscuits are supposed to help clean the dog's teeth, promoting oral health.  <1> That's certainly an added benefit! It's very hard to brush a dog's teeth! Can you recommend a good brand of biscuits? <0> No, but just make sure it's not dog's bread. It's a special bread made with ground glass, poison and needles intended to kill dogs.  <1> Ill be careful not to buy that, Ill take a look at the local pet store then
<0> I am looking forward to fall. It is my favorite season. <1> mine too.. the nature is so peaceful and beautiful during the fall

I took over my family farm so buying some new equipment put me there. <0> That sounds like no fun! People don't realize the giant cost of farming equipment and maintenance <1> All the equipment i need is seriously draining my savings but being that the season is changing I can catch myself up because I wont have to buy crop products. <0> Thats good, just have to figure out a plan to payoff your debt and save enough to not have to go into it in the future <1> I know I will try to keep it in mind . Do you like sports ? <0> Oh yea! My parents put me in everything and I enjoyed most of it. How about you?

They raised him as Clark Kent. <0> That's right.

My parents hate them though. <1> Oh ! That is not good. Why your parents don't like your dogs ? <0> They are used to having a yard and my parents house doesn't have one. <1>  I understand, it is difficult for them to stay for a long time in the house. I take my dogs out every night. <0> I do as well but I'm in Nw York City so there aren't really any parks for them nearby. <1> That makes it more difficult. I take my dogs with me to visit some orphanages. the kids have a good time.

The Caroline on Broadway is one the most establish and popular comedy clubs in the US. You should try and get there some time! <1> I would love to! Why is it so popular? What's so special about ti <0> Well, I think mostly because many of the top headliner in the U.S. have performed there like Louis C.K., Jay Leno, Bill Kick etc. You like any of them? <1> I LOVE Louis C.K.!!! He is so freaking hilarious. I love his jokes about his kids and ex wife lol <0> Haha yes me to. His self depreciating and shock humor is amazing. I think he was on SNL a few time too. <1> what is SNL? <0> Saturday Night Live. It's a late night American Comedy variety show. They do funny skits. <1> Yes, I cannot stand Louis C.K., he is not funny at all.
<0> So last night I heard a window break in my house. So i jumped up and grabbed my gun to go check it out <1> Oh man, I hope everything is ok , and it was something mildly annoying like a tree limb. <0> I know about Environmental Polution <1> I've heard that.  There are a lot of controversies surrounding  proposed environmental causes
<0> I love to listen to jazz music.  It's very soothing. <1> Oh yes, especially since they have such a rich history in the African-American communities! <0> I agree!  The talent of so many of the musicians is amazing! <1> Absolutely, all the great jazz musicians know how to play the swing and blue notes that characterizes jazz <0> Miles Davis was one of the greatest jazz musicians.  Have you heard of him? <1> Oh yes, Miles Dewey Davis III was one of the greatest American jazz trumpeter, bandleader, and composer.
<0> baking is one of my favorite activities,  Baking is a method of cooking food that uses prolonged dry heat <1> I love baking too! Cheesecakes are my speciality. <0> Heat is gradually transferred "from the surface of cakes, cookies, and breads to their center, if you get it wrong it will burn <1> Yep I usually bake with bain maries to avoid burning. <0> Baking can be combined with grilling to produce a hybrid barbecue variant  have you tried it? <1> I have not. That sounds interesting though <0> Baking is related to barbecuing because the concept of the masonry oven is similar to that of a smoke pit <1> Yeah i have always wondered if they were coneected.
<0> Pasta dishes are some of the best Italian food. <1> What kind of pasta dishes do you think are the best? <0> When it comes to pasta and noodles i love fresh angel hair. <1> Ooohh! I love angel hair with lemon, basil and capers. And artichokes! <0> Yea and you can even make it with rice flour with the rare few who have gluten allergies. <1> I actually have a gluten intolerance and only eat rice pasta. Specifically the brand Tinkyada. <0> Oh really, do you prefer dried or fresh pasta? Ive always liked fresh when i can get it. <1> I've never actually had fresh pasta. I bet it is super yummy. Doesn't fresh pasta use eggs? I'm allergic to eggs.
<0> Jazz is super groovy, man. Ever heard of it? <1> Yes I have. I originated in the early 20th century in New Orleans communities! Who do you like? <0> Oh man, I have a smarty pants on my hands!  I love me some Miles Davis. Where did jazz originate? <1> Jazz is considered to be "American's classical music" to some. In New Orleans is where it originated. <0> Oh, no specific building or anything? Cool. Who is one of your favorite jazz artists and why do you like them? <1> Jazz is considered to be a truly original art form. I rally enjoy Charles Mingus <0> What instruments are usually used in a jazz orchestra? <1> The saxophone is the most famous. 
<0> Every night before bed,  we read the Bible to our son. I love when he relates what he learned to real life. <1> That is really awesome! That is so important to be involved in his life like that.  <0> It is. And shows that he is listening.  <1> It does! Kids can understand things about the bible that most adults overlook.  <0> I agree! 
<0> One thing on my bucket list is to go to the San Diego Comic Con, it is a entertainment convention held each year in San Diego. <1> I have always wanted to go to E3, the video game convention, that seems really cool as well <0> What do you think about the New York CC? It's not as old as San Diego or E3, only first held in 2006 but I think it has potential.  <1> I have never been, but I am a fan of super heroes so I would like to check it out sometime <0> I think you would like comic conventions then, there are usually a wide variety of panels, focusing on super heroes, there is also great cosplay. <1> I have seen some of the cosplay, it is usually very very well done, I am impressed by a lot of them <0> Yes, it is impressive. It has really taken off since the 1990s, the number of people doing it in Japan and the Western world has risen rapidly.  <1> That does not surprise me, look at how well super heor movies do, there is certainly a market for it <0> I don't think it's ever going to die out. It's certainly not a fad. <1> I don't think there's enough of a market to keep it going.
<0> I was happy because my best friend called me to ask about his first time moving away from home. <1> Wow that sounds like good news! <0> Yeah. He was going to college. He went for a couple years. He didn't finish there.  <1> I'm glad to hear he has moved on with his life! A huge step forward. <0> Yeah/  He thinks it is time for him to start anew.  It's the best thing.i 
<0> I was angry on my son. <1> Aww!  Why? <0> He beat up his sister! I never know how to handle these situations. I don't want to use violence against violence <1> Have you considered sending him to timeout? That would be a way to punish him without being violent with him <0> He's a bit too old for timout. Grounding him doesn't really seem to work either <1> How old is he? <0> He's 14 and his sister is 12. They've really been jerks to each other lately <1> I'm sorry you're having such a hard time with them. Beating up a sibling is a serious issue. You should find a way to punish him somehow. <0> Do you have kids? I'm just not used to this kind of conflict. I was never like this with my sister growing up so I'm not sure what to do <1> Yeah, I have two boys age 4 and they are amazing

I guess I should try that sometime if I oversleep. lol ! <0> Cold showers can make me sleepy sometimes. 
<0> I am so sad. My 3 dogs attacked my baby goat and she died last night from the injuries. Crying.... <1> Aww,  that's so sad. I'm an animal lover so I understand the pain. <0> It hurts really bad and I don't know what to do. I think I should give some dogs away to a family with no small animals. <1> That's a really tough decision either way. I wish you the best with it and hope everything improves <0> I just want to do what is best by my animals in the end.

<0> it's hard to believe the entire population of Iceland is under 400,000 <1> Yes, I think the reason is the temperature, but it is warmed by the Gulf stream <0> I love the cold weather, would move there in a heartbeat. <1> Oh, not me. I'd much rather live in a warmer climate, but it would be nice to visit once. <0> I wonder if there is n ice bar there? <1> There's gotta be. Gotta have a nice place to stay warm at drink at.  <0> Where would you live, if you could up and move? <1> South. Way south. Somewhere where is warm all the time, preferably by a beach. <0> That sounds nice, never been able to enjoy the salt life, really prefer doom and gloom.  <1> You sound like you'd be fun at parties lol.
<0> I want to learn more about jazz music <1> I don't know much about jazz music. Apparently jazz originated in New Orleans in the 19th and 20th centuries. <0> mmm, interesting. it's roots can be traced back to africa and europe  <1> Yes, I see that two specific people in Belgium spearheaded the beginning of jazz as well. It sounds like jazz was started in plenty of places. Is jazz still a strong genre today? <0> I beliebe it is. There are plenty of jazz festivals, jazz concerts, and jazz radio stations quite popular today <1> That's amazing, I wonder where it will go in the future. There's a movement called free jazz to attempt to return jazz to it's improv roots.  <0> yes, i read once that free jazz emerged in the 1950's <1> And Jazz fusion emerged in the 1960s with a combination of other genres. I don't think people appreciate jazz being so different as it has evolved and they'd like to take it back to the roots. <0> well im sure there is a different style of jazz for different audiences, just like other genres of music that have alternative styles while still being the same music  <1> yes you are right
<0> im so mad! I can't find my hair brush! <1> That is a tragedy! Where do you think you left it? Did you check your pockets? <0> i have checked everywhere.  i think my dog may have snatched it.
<0> why do you run that long ? <1> i try to do triathlons . keeps me healthy . <0> Professionally or as an amateur  <1> As an amateur. I wish I could do triathlons in the winter too. Then I could snowboard. <0> Gosh, you must be fit! I'm afraid I should do more exercise, but I go to a lot of music gigs and socialise far too much <1> Going to gigs is a great way to spend your time. Maybe dance more and you could turn that into exercise. <0> Good plan, but as my favourite band is BonIver, dancing doesn <1> Bon Iver is my favorite too! Have you been to his Eaux Claire festival? <0> Sorry, accidentally sent before finished. Wow, no I didn't, my parents aren't very approving as they are Buddhist... <1> Threyhavada Buddhist or Varajahan? <0> Sorry, didn't catch that. They are Buddhist and raised me that way also <1> I was just curious which buddhist tradition. Most aren't very strict with regards to this sort of thing.
<0> I'm not very religious so I don't know a lot about gospel music, can you tell me anything about that style? <1> Of course! I'd love to, I'm a huge fan of gospel music! It's known for its dominant vocals, strong use of harmony and Christian lyrics. It's really beautiful music. <0> That does sound powerful just reading about it, does it have a long history? <1> It does, but it's not well documented. The earliest use of the term "gospel song" was first published in 1874. <0> Oh I would imagine it's probably older than that given the history of churches I guess. Are there any famous gospel artists I should know about? <1> Well actually, before it was known as gospel music, that typical style of music can be traced back to the early 17th century. <0> Oh cool, did it have a different name back then? <1> Not really, it was known for it's hand clapping, foot stomping and a cappella singing though!
<0> I ate half a sandwich before realizing the bread was old and moldy! It was gross! <1> Oh no, I can imagine how you must have felt when you realized.  Did you get sick? <0> Luckily no, I either have an iron stomach, or I got lucky and didn't eat any of the mold <1> Wow that is lucky. Did you check the rest of the bread or just throw it out?  <0> Yeah the rest of the bread was bad too, so i tossed it.  <1> Since you didn't get sick, try to find some humor in the situation! I like to make people smile.  <0> They say you shouldn't cry over spilled milk. But what about spoiled bread?! What do I do for my carby breatheren
<0> Do you ever feel afraid? <1> A lot of the time. I'm quite an easily frightened person! Especially by large animals! <0> Yeah. I'm more scared of failing I guess <1> Have you always had a fear of falling? <0> For as long as I can remember, yeah.
<0> hello , are you attending church in the morning ? <1> only if i can get a ride . i am very old and cannot drive <0> if i lived close , i'd take you . i teach sunday school . <1> how nice . you must love kids . <0> i do . i do not have any , my dogs are my children . <1> would you like to know the secret to living as long as i've ? <0> yes , please . that would be wonderful . <1> drinking wine , and dancing in the moonlight . <0> very nice . i do both as well . <1> doing both of those things has helped me make it to my 100th birthday . <0> oh wow . i hope i live as long as you ! <1> i may be old , but i'm stronger than i look !
<0> Hi there, I love showers. Some showers are even outdoors! <1> Showering is the first thing I do in the morning. I've never showered outdoors, though. <0> After a shower I feel clean and fresh. I usually take one before I go to sleep. <1> Do you prefer a hot shower or cold shower at that point then? <0> I usually take a hot shower in the morning in order to bathe myself and warm up. What about you, do you usually take your showers at morning or night? <1> I like to take showers at night since it helps me to fall asleep.
<0> I find Ferrari's interesting but don't know much about them <1> Its only of the most iconic Italian sports car company in the world and makes all their cars in Maranello, Italy. <0> So there's no other manufacturing warehouse for Ferrari anywhere in the world? <1> Nope and it was bought by Fiat in 1969 and 1988 for a combined stake of 90 percent. <0> You seem very knowledgeable about Ferrari! What else do you know about them?  <1> It was founded by Enzo Ferrari and the Ferrari Enzo is one of the most expensive classic car in the world. <0> Do you happen to know how much? <1> Not exactly, but it's several hundred thousand I think!
<0> That's great! Is it a medical degree that you're working on? <1> Thats right! Since its the only way I can become a mental health professional. <0> Don't you feel exhausted from that? <1> No, it think it is my social mission <0> That's so cool! How's you decide your social mission!? <1> I am democrat, I have been involved into local politics and I have noticed that we need to give back <0> That's amazing! I'm a mother and wish I could do more! <1> You should get involved <0> I have three kids, that takes up the most of my time! <1> how old are they? <0> 2 6 and 8! A crazy bunch! <1> wow. I am living with my giant parents
<0> Is that it? I never owned a Betta Fish, I had a few goldfish when I was a kid. Do you know how long those live? <1> I do not. I do know they are the most common kept aquarium fish though. <0> Oh wow I really love fish they're the best. All of my preschool classmates love them too. <1> They are pretty cool.  I like the king betta.  They are about 2 inches are either beige or white. <0> I didn't know that about the King Betta, that is awesome. Outside of Bettas I enjoy playing outside, how about you? <1> i'll watch them sometimes . i'd rather be outside honestly . fishing or hunting . <0> Agreed, outside things are so much more fun. The park is a great place to play and be with family.
<0> I'm looking forward to meeting with some friends on the weekend <1> Oh that's cool!  What do you all have planned? <0> Probably go hiking and visit some local towns <1> Well that sounds like a fun little trip. <0> It is, I have not seen them in ages. 
<0> I don't know a lot about motorcycles but I have heard of Harley-Davidson  <1> Yeah, the Harley-Davison motorcycles are awesome. They're an American motorcycle founded in Milwaukee in 1903. My dad drives one! <0> Awesome! Are they the most popular motorcycle brand in the US? <1> Definitely! They're also one of two American motorcycle companies to survive the Great Depression. The company has been going strong for years making good bikes. <0> That is interesting. Is this brand common in the rest of the world? <1> Yes, they have factories all over the world. York, Pennsylvania; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Kansas City, Missouri; Manaus, Brazi. Just to name a few places. They're a popular biker club motorcycle. <0> Who is their biggest competitor? <1> I don't know to be honest! Yamaha and Kawasaki both are very popular motorcycle brands. But Harley-Davidson also makes merchandise, home decor, ornaments and accessories.   
<0> I love the color red - it has been an important color for centuries <1> It has been important both negative and positive. <0> Colors can have different effects on people - there are whole fields of study about this <1> So what is that study called?  What does red do to people? <0> Straight men tend to like red outfits, while straight females do not agree <1> I did not know that.  Do straight men like them on themselves or women? <0> Straight men like them on women, although lots of other factors effect things as well <1> That's interesting. I wonder how straight men like blue.
<0> So I currently have 4 gray hairs. When I get 10 I'm dying my hair as black as night. Have you colored your hair? <1> I used to do it at home (not professionally) but I'm going to stop and let the grey hair take over. Grey hair is pretty trendy now.  <0> I'm gonna pass on the Gray's. I blame them on my wife.  <1> And I'm sure she blames hers on you! Funny how gray hair is associated with age AND stress. Which is it? <0> She is a genetic freak and has 0. <1> She's a "natural" freak - one with a genetic abnormality. Better that than a "made" freak who alters themselves at some point.  <0> As for stress that makes sense I had none until I took over as manager as the highest rated hotel in America. I'm stressed daily. <1> Trump Hotel? You poor man. bwahahahah!  <0> Actually trump is rated as the 3rd best hotel in the world. I could only be so lucky.  <1> I normally don't color my hair.

<0> So, my girlfriend and I are going to San Diego this weekend for a work trip! <1> Do you have any plans for it? That sounds exciting! <0> It's very exciting I just can't wait my girl friend loves animals cats especially so we are defiantly going to the zoo first.  <1> I haven't been to the zoo in a long time, I hope you have fun. I used to have a pet cat but had to give it away.  <0> Thank you i know we will you should plan a zoo trip soon. Why did you give your cat away?  <1>  I got the cat without asking my parents. My dad got upset and I had to give it away to my friend. <0> Are you serious omg I know your parents was upset but they could have let you keep it. What kind of hobbies do you like.  <1> Yes, it was sad. I enjoy reading, playing soccer, and video games. How about you? <0> I'M kind of weird lol I love doing ice and wood sculpting for fun. i love hiking and reading is my favorite to. What books do you like? 
<0> 7 is my favourite lucky number! <1> Really, well you will find it cool that various Hindus wrote 7 more or less in one stroke as a curve that looks like an uppercase J vertically inverted. <0> Really? What other cultures have history with the letter? <1> Well, the western Ghubar Arabs' main contribution was to make the longer line diagonal rather than straight, though they showed some tendencies to making the character more rectilinear. <0> really i think i would prefer it more curved
<0> I have a personal vendetta against all stingrays and manta rays for what they did to my boy Steve Irwin. <1> Yeah I was deep sea fishing and it took almost 30 minutes for me to reel one in because they are so strong. <0> Oh that's so cool! Were you fishing in tropical waters? I wouldn't even know where to go to fish for them. <1> Well you have to think they are built to be strong underwater. So when you fish them they are literal battles to reel them in. <0> I can see that, yeah, they're huge. Aren't they a protected species though? At least in international waters? <1> Well this was just off the Texas coast and it was fresh water. I dont think they were protected the boat captain made it seem like they were more of a problem than anything.
<0> hello ! i am absolutely loving retirement . <1> hi i am ready to retire what was your occupation <0> i was an engineer , now i get to relax . what do you do ?
<0> let me tell you something... childcare is so expensive!! <1> It is but quality care at a young age is so important <0> i agree and that's why i'm a stay at home mom. I used to work at a daycare and there is so much negligence!  <1> Yes, child care providers are actually the first teachers a child has <0> unless you home school :) then you are the first teacher <1> Quality care can mean everything in the world to future success of a child <0> i strongly agree!  <1> I guess that cultural conventions are important for young kids also
<0> I enjoy jazz music, or "America's classical music" as some like to call it. Do you like jazz? <1> I do like Jazz. I think Billie Holiday and The Rippingtons are great! <0> Oh yes, Billie Holiday, or Lady Day as her friend used to call her. She was a legend for sure! <1> Yes Lady Day! I really liked a lot of her songs. <0> What I loved about her was that she has excellent vocal delivery and improvisational skills.  <1> Oh yes I think she did a lot of doo wop <0> Yea I believe she did. All I know is that I love jazz music, and it's been hailed as one of America's original art forms.  <1>  I used to listen to Jazz music at a bar on the patio. 
<0> My husband wont be back for a month due to work and Im here at the house by myself. <1> Im sure that is tough.  You must really miss him. <0> Yeah i have no pets or children so im just here in an empty house.  <1> Do you get nervous being on your own? <0> Nah just bored. Im new to this city so I dont know anybody either.  <1> Oh that sounds even tougher.  It is a long time but I hope it flies by for you and your hubby is back home again.
<0> wow . do you plan on keeping that farm in your family ? <1> i do its such a great lifestyle <0> Is it a good investment long term? <1> I really haven't thought of it as an investment.  It's more about a good place to raise my kids. <0> The kids could learn so much living on a farm. <1> I know I did.  And we had a lot of fun, too. <0> How many generations has the farm been in your family? <1> I'm the third.  My grandparents bought the place, then my dad took over, now it's up to me.
<0> When was it first discovered? <1> Well it's a pretty popular fish.  They're called black bass, and distributed throughout a large area east of the rocky mountains, all the way from Hudson bay in Canada to Mexico.  That makes it hard to say when they were first discovered. <0> Yea I bet , well that is interesting <1> in the creeks around here , it is mostly trout or in the lakes large mouths . <0> Oh ok , well I dont know much about fishing <1> I love to fish. I also like fishing to reduce invasive species. They are a danger to our ecosystem.
<0> I love Snoop Dogg, he's my favorite rapper. His real name is actually Calvin Cordozar Broadus, much easier to say Snoop Dogg though. <1> I can't say I listen to his music at all, but I still respect him as an artist. <0> I think that's a fair and respectable attitude to have. You certainly can't deny his success, having sold over 35 million albums worldwide after all. <1> I don't think that number even accounts for all of the collaborations he's done with other artists. <0> I'm sure you're right about that, he's definitely worked with a lot of other artists. I like his second album called Tha Doggfather a lot. <1> I can't recall any of the songs of of that album.  I know my sister had his first album, which was odd because she was only nine when it came out. <0> That's weird I guess, but music knows no age. I like the album because he worked on it after he was cleared of a murder charge, so I think it has some deep feelings in it. <1> Who wouldn't have deep feelings about that?  Whenever he's on TV with Martha Stewart, it's easy to forget that the only one who's a felon on screen is her.
<0> I've heard of them but haven't listened to their music. <1> Theyre great, they are an American heavy metal band and really pushed metal into the light of the general public and help make it a huge genre. <0> Have you ever seen them live? <1> Unfortunately not , money is tight at the moment ! It’s a massive dream of mine however !   <0> It's crazy and worth it for sure! I've only seen them once in Nashville but I'd say it was the best show I've ever been to. <1> Wow that sounds great , must be a really exhilarating experience, congratulations! Planning on seeing anyone else in the future ? <0> I do plan on going to Washington DC on New Years to see Skrillex. Different genre but still a good show! <1> I don't think I would like going to a live concert seems like it would be boring.
<0> hello how are you doing ? <1> great , how are you doing today ? <0> i'm great . what do you like to do ? <1> watching horror movies is my favorite . how about you ? <0> i am more into comedies . <1> i see . what do you do for work

<0> I really  love Superman and the the comics <1> Me too! He was created by high school students <0> I never knew that, maybe it was his alter ego? <1> I don't think so.  It was two high school students living in Cleveland Ohio. <0> That is kind of exciting, Superman is from the 40's isnt it? <1> The character was created in 1933 but didn't debut with DC comics until 1938. <0> Superman has always been an American hero, I think not so much anymore people seem to like the for violent heroes
<0> I trust my family, they have never let me down <1> Its always good to have solid family members.  Not everyone has that. <0> I find I need my family more now that I'm out of school. <1> do you have a large or small family? <0> 2 brothers, 3 sisters <1> Cool, siblings can be like really good friends if they get along. I'd say me and my sister get along pretty well. <0> I love them all. I'm the baby. <1> It's awesome to have so many siblings, do they all live close to you? <0> They're all on the West Coast, which is horrible. I'm on the East. <1> That can be very rough. Maybe you can move there soon! <0> It's too fake out there. And I have my own kids, now. <1> that's unfortunate that they are so far, do you do family reunions yearly?
<0> I love baking. Do you like to bake? <1> Yes I love using prolonged dry heat to make cookies! <0> nice. what does that mean? <1> It means I put the dough, normally in the an oven, and wait for it to dry. <0> That's cool, how long have you been baking cookies for?
<0> hey , what is your least favorite food ? mine is chicken . <1> really ? who does not like chicken ? even chickens like chicken . <0> maybe it is because i want to be a nurse , and i see food poisoning from it . <1> hmm . . . i thought about nursing after my chemistry degree . . glad i didn't <0> chemistry ? that is interesting . regardless , college is so expensive . <1> yep . i peddle books out of a bus now love it <0> nice ! i work the night shift at a bar just to keep up with expenses . <1> Oh for school expenses?
<0> Do you enjoy a good wine tasting. I find I meet the most interesting people at them. <1> Oh that is the sensory evaluation of wine, I enjoy it a bit <0> My local Vineyard had a pairing last weekend with cupcakes. O' my it was awesome. <1> You know the practice of wine tasting is as old as the practice of wine making <0> I'd imagine you have to taste it when you make it. <1> Around 14th century a more formalized method became established <0> Which country formalized it? 
<0> When I took my daughter to Sea World she loved looking at the large manta rays.  <1> I love Sea World!

It takes us 3 days in order to see and do everything!  I especially love Space Mountain! <0> Oh I totally agree Disney is a vacation you have to go for days because the park is so big and the Resorts are fun also I loved staying there as a kid. <1> We always stay at the Disney World resort - I really love that it includes all the means and transportation to the park!
<0> my son had his wisdom teeth removed,  and i took the opportunity to baby him a bit. he is 24 <1> oh yea i had those out 2 years ago it sucks

And, you cn do multiple things at one time.   <0> Multitasking a blessing and a curse
<0> Got to the hotel where I booked my room, and it turns out they gave my room to someone else! <1> What?! You should ask them for a free upgrade, because that's not cool. <0> yes I will  <1> That is good, if I was in that position I would demand the room color be purple. <0> I think I would ask for a pink one  <1> Both are good colors, but purple is my favorite. <0> I like pink or white <1> Thats great, I also enjoy dogs . So a hotel full of puppies would be nice as well. <0> yes that would be so nice <1> What would be your favorite animal <0> dogs and you
<0> Well,  not too bad. I felt really nervous the other day though. <1> Oh no,  what happened?
<0> Have you ever been to the zoo just to realize that animals can be just as good as humans? <1> I do enjoy the zoo and the animals. I think they could be just as good.
<0> I just dyed my hair light purple. I am really excited about it! <1> That sounds amazing!  Hair color can be done by a hairdresser or at home, how did you do yours? <0> I went to a hairdresser to have it done. <1> I wish I could see it!  Hair dying has a long history.  In ancient Greece the Celtic people dyed their hair blonde. <0> That's really cool! How did they manage that? <1> They bleached it by washing it in lime and combing it back!  Crazy to think of that happening so long ago.
<0> I have 2 dogs and a cat. I am forever buying dog biscuits. Do you have dogs? <1> I do not have dogs but my friend does and she loves to give her dog dog biscuits. <0> My bigger dog usually goes into petsmart and chooses which ones he wants <1> That is so cute. My friend has a medium shaped dog and gives her dog biscuits that help clean the dogs teeth. <0> I give mine that too. They help keep their breath under control too. <1> Oh yeah!

That would be a dominant wavelength of 625 to 740 nanometres! <1> always red looks so pleasant
<0> Who coined the word sleep? <1> Dr. S.A. Kinnier Wilson coined the term. Sleep has REMs which is a mode which allow the body to rest or sleep in deeper states <0> I am so glad we can sleep. I probably sleep 10 hours a day. <1> Our bodies go in anabolic state during sleep so our Muscular, skeletal and immune systems can restore and repair <0> my system needs to be restored.

That is great. <0> She alwyas tried to m make us do what she wanted us to do. We were unable to think for ourselves.
<0> I wrote an email to a family member I haven't spoken to in a long time and I wasn't sure how they'd take everything I said in it. <1> Oh wow! That is a brave thing to do! Your letter must have been a little intense if you are worried how they will take it. How did it work out? <0> Yep,  it was full of emotion and a lot of things I needed to get off my chest. I was quite nervous waiting for a response but it turns out I had nothing to worry about. She was really glad I spoke up! <1> Awe that is great! I am glad there was a happy ending!

<0> Do you believe that there will ever be an alien invasion? <1> no. only in science fiction stories and movies lol  <0> amazing, since you are quite knowledgeable, how do we define an alien invasion?  <1> it's simply aliens invade the Earth either to exterminate human life or harvest people for food, steal the planet's resourses <0> When did this word ever come into play? have there been any sightings? or it's just a figment of someone's imagination <1> Alien invasion was a common metaphor in US science fiction during the Cold War <0> Do you think Hollywood might have blown the whole idea of alien invasion out of proportion? <1> I don't think so. i think a lot of people like the idea of aliens contacting Earth and observing it either to invade or sometimes help humans
<0> My roommate is gone for the week,  on a business trip. It's way too quiet around here. <1> Maybe you should try and have a party?
<0> So true story. I once swam with Manta Ray and it was awesome. <1> Ive never seen one up close. I know theyre mostly found in warm, subtropic waters. <0> I didn't know much about them when it happened.  What countries are they found in? <1> I only know they are found in the subtropics. I would assume places like Australia or wherever they can feed on zooplankton. <0> Do they get pretty big?  The one I saw appeared to be a baby. <1> I know the oceanic ones are the biggest. Dont know how big. The larger ones are the birostris species. <0> Birostris species? So there are lots of different types of Manta Ray?
<0> I came home in my new mclaren to show it to my friend. <1> Whow! That is one mean car!   What did your friend say? <0> She was super excited and wanted to go for a ride immediately <1> Lucky you, I'm sure she was also impressed with you. <0>  I am married and she said my hubby must love me very much to get me that car <1> She's right, unless you paid for it yourself, lol. <0> I did not and would not. I gave him two children, so I deserve it. I drove up playing Charlie Daniels, who is my favorite. <1> Good for you and yes you do deserve it.  <0> What  is your favorite car  <1> My favorite is actually the mcclaren so i'm jealous right now.
<0> I'm feeling a lot more tired than I usually have been. I'm worried I might have an illness of some kind, like chronic fatigue. <1> Thats not good, A doctor can usually diagnose you based on a your symptoms, You should get that checked out.  <0> What kinds of symptoms should I really be concerned about? Surely if I'm just tired I don't have to assume the worst, right? <1> i wouldnt assume the worst, But currently there is no known cure, But there is promising treatment for it.  <0> What kinds of treatments are there? I think I might need more exercise. <1> Well different doctors have shown that the use of the medication rintatolimod can greatly help with the symptoms. <0> Whoa, that's a mouthful of a drug name. What's the brand name? And what side effects should I be worried about? <1> I believe the brand is Nucome and the side effect are minimal which mainly include nausea or a headache.
<0> Oh me either! It seems like such a long time ago. I wonder when Internet was first created? <1> It used to be restricted, but around 1995, the restricted were lifted and commercial use of it began <0> That's interesting. I can imagine having the restrictions lifted helped artists and collectors share their work. I love huge paintings! <1> I'm an art lover too, I have a house full of it! <0> Oh how wonderful! Who are your favorite artists? <1> I really like Albrecht Durer <0> Oh a German renaissance painter! I like abstract works, personally. <1> I never got into abstract works, who are your favorites?
<0> I have been feeling a little lonely lately  <1> I'm sorry to hear that! Maybe you can find a local club so you can meet people with similar interests! <0> What are you hobbies? <1> Hunting, fishing and computers. <0> Those are good hobbies! I should try them out sometime.
<0> Well, then maybe I like Heavy metal, because I like Van Halen.  What is acid rock? <1> It grew out of 196's drug culture.  Think of Jimi Hendrix and his distorted guitar solos and long improvised jams. <0> That's so interesting. I like listening to all genres of music, except country music. <1> Same! More of a metal guy. Always blasting it in my black car! <0> Very cool :) I like to listen to music and podcasts while I drive, it helps pass the time <1> Me too.  It really helps get me going on the drive in. <0> Yep, gotta do something to pass the time. Audiobooks are fun too <1> Yes, audiobooks are great. Have you heard about Carrier language? <0> I've never heard of that, what is it? <1> It's a Northern Athabaskan dialect, named after the Daketh people. <0> That's really cool! Are you listening to an audiobook about that?
<0> I was in an antique store and found a really old coin for cheap. It was real and its very valuable. I'm so happy! <1> thats awesome! <0> Do you collect anything? <1> no i don't collect anything. However, I am into traveling. I come from a big city. Which city did you find the antique store? I love treasure hunts. :-) <0> I went with one of my brothers to get a tattoo in Ponchatoula, we went into the antique store next to the tattoo shop. <1> i am so jealous!!! that sounds amazing. on a teacher's salary I don't get out of town often, but when I do...visit exotic, unheard of places-priority. <0> That's fun. I don't get to travel much either because I have two dogs I would have to board.  <1> awww I've always wanted a dog. I've only had cats, which I love, but you can't really bring them places. :-( <0> So where is the coolest place you have visited? <1> Cancun. Niagra Falls. I'm interested in Hawaii or Bora Bora. :-) <0> wow, they're really great places
<0> Ferrari's the coolest Italian sports cars, wouldn't you agree? <1> I heard those cars are the fastest cars in the world <0> Yes, in 2014 Ferrari was rated the world's most powerful brand. If only I could afford one, haha <1> Do you know how much those cars cost? <0> I have no idea, but it must be a lot! The founder Enzo Ferrari founded the company in 1939, so think of the inflation! <1> i cant even imagine!
<0> My friend recently moved far away and I have really been missing her. <1> How far away is she ? <0> i used to be able to walk to her home, but i have to drive over an hour now <1> that's a long drive may be she miss you too <0> we have been friends for many years and have competed in 5k walks together <1> that is very impressive you should visit her.. <0> i hope my honda civic will make it to see her <1> drive safely dont overspeed in eager to see her <0> thank you.  i just found out that my boyfriend is flying her and i on a surprise trip together! <1> wow that's amazing ....have a nice trip and enjoy together <0> thank you.  do you like to walk for fun or health reasons? <1> i like to do if i have a company ...i like to talk and walk
<0> red is one of the best colors <1> I agree, I think its because its at the end of the visible spectrum of light <0> yes, and really plainly it is pretty awesome, and does have meaning behind it <1> Yes, in the Renaissance, the brilliant red costumes for the nobility and wealthy so it did have meaning. <0> I wonder if there is a significant meaning today? <1> The red sky at sunset results from Rayleigh scattering which is important part of physics today. <0> I am pretty sure there is red in the rainbow as well <1> You're right, plus iron oxide also gives the red color to the planet Mars. I wish I could do there myself! <0> Red will always have a meaning and is amazing.

<0> I love pasta! It is a must have for Italians! My favorite is plain noodles with butter and Parmesan cheese.  <1> I love pasta too and am also Italian background! But I prefer it with marinara sauce.  <0> Butter and Parmesan is one of the oldest ways to serve pasta. <1> I did not know that, maybe I should try it sometime. What other foods do you like? <0> I do also like fettuccine alfredo, which is a spin-off of butter and parmesan noodles, made popular in the mid 20th century. <1> You know a lot about pasta! My grandparents used to make their pasta at home from scratch, I always found that the most delicious.  <0> Homemade pasta really is the best! I love italian food. It really has had a nice effect on many cuisines around the world. <1> That's very true. Italian food is so wholesome and good.
<0> I am always so tired.  I'm beginning to wonder if I have chronic fatigue syndrome. <1> If you do, you can treat it with cognitive behavioral therapy. <0> what does that consist of? <1> It focuses on coping strategies such as problem solving. <0> Are there any other therapies available? <1> There are but I can't laid my hand on some of them right now, you can just search it up.
<0> So we get to talk about brown hair, which I have. Fun stuff... <1> Brain hair is a really nice color. What shade is yours? <0> Medium with red undertones. Have a lot of red in my beard also <1> That's pretty cool. I myself have black curly hair, it's kind of hard to manage them sometimes. <0> Black hair is actually the most common just above brown. My hair is just flat and straight and gets poofy when its humid out. <1> Oh yes humidity and dryness in the air can both affect the hair a lot. In general weather can affect the hair.
<0> Hi! I love baking. Do you bake? Do you know much about the history of baking?  <1> I used to do quite a bit of baking, but I ended up eating too many of my goods! <0> I got more into baking after watching the Great British Bake Off. I loved seeing the different challenges and guessing who would be eliminated.  <1> I never got into competitive cooking shows. There is too much put on the judges. I want to taste them myself. <0> The Great British Bake Off is very different from american cooking shows. It's all really friendly, there isn't any drama.  <1> I will have to check that out. Is it on a streaming service like Netflix? <0> It is! The stars of the show are the hosts- Mary and Sue! You're going to love them.  <1> Well, I know how I'm spending my next weekend. <0> Do it! Glee is also on Netflix, Highly recommend checking that one out too! It's about a high school glee club.  <1> I have tried being on a cooking show once, they tasted it first because i dont like testing cakes first.
<0> I'm so sad,  my avocado was moldy this morning! <1> hahah it whas happened to me it the worst thing <0> It really is! :( <1> did you still eat it? or did you throw it away <0> I was planning to still eat it, but it was too moldy.
<0> My son starts kindergarten next month. I don't know what I will do since I don't work. <1> That really is a big change for you! Are you excited to have some more down time? <0> I am but also not sure how I feel like him "leaving the nest".  <1> Yeah,  that feeling will change when you see him coming home with a huge smile on his face!
<0> Vanilla is my favorite, Strawberry would be my second choice. <1> A lot of restaurants prepare their milkshakes "by hand". They use scoops of ice cream and milk mixed in a blender. <0> What's your favorite place to buy a milkshake I think mines is Steak -N- Shake.  <1> My  favorite place is a small ice cream shop near my home.  Love it. <0> Sounds interesting what are some of your hobbies when free?  <1> By the way, I heard that steak n shake is doing away with the cherries on their shakes. <0> I would hope I never eat them anyways. Are you currently in SCHOOL I'm in undergrad studying business.  <1> Yes, I am in school as a senior!
<0> that is good of ya , sometimes we all need a little prayer , like tigers baseball <1> yeah i worry alot about what they're going to do ! maybe my apps will help . <0> I've really only been to one baseball game in person! <1> Really? What did you think of it? <0> It was fun but a fly ball landed in the bleachers just a few feet behind my wife and I.  Kinda scary! <1> Imagine if you caught that ball? Would be quite a memory
<0> After a long day I finally got my dog settled down and I dont have any work.  It feels nice to just sit for a little bit. <1> thats nice to be able to relax <0> Have you had a good day?  Hopefully you dont have a busy weekend and can relax a little bit. <1> everyday is a good day! <0> I hear that , gotta stay positive and keep your head up brother.

Do you exercise? <1> I love coffee, actually. I drink a few cups every morning! <0> Me too, it's the only way to function in my opinion if anyone likes coffee I can't trust them.
<0> Hey, how do you feel about weird hair? I've done some hair coloring, or hair dying, and I have changed to purple hair.  <1> I think hair coloring is cool. My youngest daughter has had pink hair. <0> That's pretty awesome. More people are doing it. In the US, at home coloring reached $1.9 billion in 2011. That's a lot of dye.  <1> I agree! That is a whole lot of dye! lol So how do you like your purple hair? <0> I like it a lot! The color is great. In the US and Europe, purple is associated with royalty and magic. Sorta cool.  <1> Do you like in Europe or the United States? Purple is my favorite color. My friends actually call me PIRPS for short. lol <0> I live in the United States. What an cool nickname!

<0> I plan on going to San Diego Comic-Con next year. <1> Very cool!  Comic Con is an entertainment and comic convention held every year in San Diego, Ca. <0> Do you know how long the event lasts? <1> It is a 4 day long event from Thursday to Sunday. <0> Wow, i'm going to have to pack a lot of outfits then. Who founded the event? <1> Initially it was called the Golden State Comic Book Convention when founded by Richard Alf, Shel Dorf, Ken Krueger, and Mike Towry. <0> What are some of the things that you can see showcased at the event? <1> Well it isn't a comic book convention, so you can't bring or show any comic books
<0> I really love comic books. Have you ever been to San Diego Comic-Con?  <1> I know it's held annually, but I've never been.  Tell me about it! <0> People from all over the country, and sometimes other countries, show up and wait in lines for hours to meet famous artists and actors.  <1> It's a 4 day even in July in San Diego, so I'd think it's one of the larger comic-cons. <0> I've heard that before. I think the only other large one is New York Comic-Con. I hear they have exclusive items to buy there.  <1> I would probably go as a Trekkie if I ever went since they are derivatives of science-fiction conventions. <0> Oh like as a character from Star Trek? Do you speak the alien language they use?  <1> I speak Vulcan.  I live by logic and reason, minus emotion. <0> I've never met anyone that speaks Vulcan.
<0> That sounds fancy. What kind do you have. <1> I love any type of pianoforte . What actually draws me to the instrument is the terms "piano" and "forte"  which mean "soft" and "loud" respectively <0> Interesting, I like piano music. I can't play, but I loike it. How long have you been listening to piano? Do you play? <1> since i can remember . i enjoy it a lot . <0> Do you have a favorite pianist? <1> i like jakob ludwig he was a germ composer and pianist he was born in the early 1800s <0> Interesting. I don't know much about famous pianists, or about playing. Is it hard to learn? <1> It takes lots of lots of practice at first. Do you play any instruments? <0> I can play a little guitar, and I play the drums a little too.  <1> wow , i would love to hear you play some time . <0> I'm not very good, but I continue to practice
<0> I'm torn up, my dog had to be put down today because of old age <1> Oh my Gosh. I am sorry. that can be really tough. <0> my puppy was 18 years old.  i don't think there is another that can take her place. she was beautiful. <1> Oh goodness, that has to be hard. 18 is a long life for a dog, but it never feels like it's long enough <0> i know. my son was hinting at finding me a new pup ... but i am not feelin' that.  the attachment and all. <1> That makes sense, it's a big commitment. It's ok if it's not the right time. <0> I am not sure if there will ever be a right time for me to get a new pup.
<0> Good morning, what a guy Superman is eh <1> What a guy! Truly a Superman is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books  <0> He is but he is a global phenomenon! Even if he does wear underpants on the outside and not be a massive fan of kryptonite <1> Kryptonite Man is the name of several supervillains who appear in stories published by DC Comics,so you agree super man is one,don't you? <0> A superhero, yeah. Not going to lie I have not read many of the comics just the movies <1> Yeah the movies are great but I love the comics as well Superman is by favourite of them all though.
<0> I am ready for my law exam <1> The big one? The bar? That's a whole lot of schooling and effort culminating in to one test!

<0> I have a cruise planned for me and my family labor day weekend.  <1> That sounds wonderful!  I've never been on a cruise,  I bet you are excited and ready to go!
<0> I still love superman even though he is  a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. <1> I love superman, but don't know very much about him. What planet is he from? <0> It would surprise you to know that superman was the figment of then high school students imagination writer Jerry Siegel and artist Joe Shuster, <1> That's very surprising. I wonder if they are rich from creating such a popular figure. <0> Yea, the two young school boys sold Superman to Detective Comics which became DC Comics, in 1938. <1> What is his story line about? <0> The company did their homework as they featured superman in appeared in various radio serials, newspaper  and other like medias <1> Have you watched the recent superman movies?
<0> do you prefer dry or fresh pasta? <1> I have always preferred fresh pasta it's much better how about yourself? <0> i too like fresh pasta, just can't make it <1> Have you tried to learn to or just does not turn out properly? <0> i have tried to make it using flour and eggs, it always turns out dough <1> I, too, have always had that issue when I make pasta, however dry is not bad any preferred brands? <0> I think they all taste the same as dried pasta goes.  what about you? <1> Now that i think about it - I prefer dry pasta.

Are they board games or video games? <1> Video games. <0> How often do you play video games? <1> a couple times a week and yourself?
<0> I am so happy I haven't ahd to put my children in childcare or daycare and have someone else caring and supervising them. <1> Yes, I would always be nervous about what happens during the time away from my children. <0> I know that is how I felt, you never know what happens when nannies, babysitters, teachers or other providers are taking care of your children <1> Actual references from close friends would be the only way I would go with a babysitter <0> I would definitely be more inclined to go that route when choosing the perfect care giver for my kids. I would feel even better using an extended family member of my child <1> Absolutely.  It would be perfect to have a family member involved.  The extra pure love is key! <0> Very true, that is why I think it is best when parents or or legal guardians take care of their children, because they are they only ones that love the children <1> It is difficult for some who do not have the financial resources to stay home though.  Tough situation.
<0> I think everyday how fortunate I am to have a house, car, food, water and air to breathe. There are so many people in the world who don't even have clean water to drink <1> You are so right. Even some of the worst conditions in my home country are better than most. <0> Agreed. When I'm having a bad day, I think about how bad the people in third world countries have it. <1> we need to more for them, you dont see enough of it on social media <0> So true. It amazes me how much people fail to realize their fortunes. I watch people in bars act like they have not a single care in the world. <1> agreed <0> Being an angry person already, it just makes matters worse, ya know? <1> you are so right there i suppose <0> It makes me want to be more approachable so I can inform people on the horrors other countries have to endure.
<0> I used the restroom at a nice restaurant and I had toilet paper stuck to my shoe and didn't know it until I left.  <1> Oh that is the worst feeling! I hate using the restroom in public as is. 
<0> I can't believe I walked in on someone using the restroom.  <1> Oh my,  that must've been an embarrassing situation! <0> It was! I knocked first and no one answered,  so I thought it was okay to go in.  <1> That's ok,  you did the right thing. It probably happens to lots of people. <0> I still feel so embarrassed because the person seemed so shocked
<0> I really need to change doctors! <1> Why is that? <0> He keeps screwing up my prescription!  I've needed it for a week now but they keep sending it to the wrong place or use the wrong name <1> Wow,  that's no good. I hope they get it worked out soon.
<0> Red is such a pretty color, don't you think? <1> I like that its wavelenght is 625-740 nanometres. <0> Oh wow! That's a new one for me! How many different shades are there? <1> I am not sure but red is a primary color. <0> Yep, along with yellow and blue right? <1> Yes, the RGB color model is an additive color model. <0> Don't they use that in old projection tvs to produce the screen images?
<0> I was so happy that after many years in retail I found a better job. <1> Congratulations! Retail really does suck.
<0> I was recently promoted at my job. I didn't expect it to happen,  but I got it through hard work so I'm pretty excited about it! <1> That is great! Doing what? <0> Thank you! I'm now a district manager for a local chain of businesses. It's not my favorite thing to do,  but the raise is great! <1> I bet that is nice and probably has good benefits!
<0> I really love jazz as a musical genre.  Do you like jazz? <1> Yes, my favorite style of jazz music is called Free Jazz <0> I have never heard of free jazz.  What are some of its most popular artists? <1> It is hard to explain it because it cannot be define and was never really a genre of music <0> My favorite jazz musician is Duke Ellington.  Who is your favorite? <1> One of my favorite Jazz musicians is Adelaide Hall.
<0> Oh man.  I was at the store yesterday and my nose just started bleeding like crazy! <1> That's terrible! What did you do?
<0> Good Morning, for my job I review candidates and the one I had recently was far and away the best one I have ever interviewed <1> That is great, did you offer them the job? <0> i did and they accepted  <1> Great, I hope they are not just a good interviewer, but a good worker as well! <0> i have very high hopes for them to have a great career with us.  <1> I bet they will.  That's the way to look at things.  With some optimism!
<0> I love the taste of pasta mixed with tomato sauce and shredded cheese all over it <1> I just love mines with chunky tomatoes mixed with meatballs and mushrooms. <0> Olive Garden is the place that makes the best pastas. I try to visit the place as much I can with my friends <1> I love Olive Garden especially the original one in Orlando they opened in 1982. <0> I think Italians have special genes that makes them so adept at preparing pastas <1> I believe so as well I would love to visit Argentina that is where Italian-born people reside great pasta I bet. <0> I don't know how they do it, but no matter how hard I try to prepare one at home, mine ends up with some peculiar taste <1> The taste is so full of an abundance of taste it just can't be copied lol.  <0> It's too bad, too, because I would love to be able to recreate it!
<0> I love the taste of Gouda cheese. <1> Me too! it is such a great mild cheese <0> I eat it usually on the weekends with wine. <1> It pairs great with it and it is one of the most popular cheeses in the world <0> That does not surprise me. <1> The first mention of Gouda cheese was is 1184! <0> Gouda cheese <1> The cheese itself is names after a Dutch city. <0> That is a long time ago. <1> In the middle ages the Dutch could obtain rights that would give them a monopoly on certain goods like cheese <0> That is interesting. Did the Dutch make any other types of cheese besides Gouda?
<0> I never feel more at peace than laying at my bed in the morning. <1> Sometimes I feel the same as you ... but I get up and move on <0> Some mornings my cat is on the bed, a little bundle of heat next to me. <1> My cat is usually sleeping on top of me in the morning.  I am always trying to move him without waking him up. <0> I do that also, but then he decides he wants his breakfast, and then it's hard to ignore him. <1> Mine is the same and he asks loudly! <0> And then after he eats, he can spend the rest of the day sleeping.  But I have to stay up and go to work. <1> I am retired, and if I sit down for even a minute my cat is in my lap.  He can be a nuisance  <0> Maybe offices would be more fun if we had cats at our desks. <1> That I totally agree with, there is something soothing and comforting about hearing a cat purring. <0> I think retirement will be better than working in many respects, not just cat availability. <1> I love retirement.  How far from retirement are you?
<0> hi how is it going over there ? <1> hi i'm doing good . was just reading a book trying to relax . <0> good . i just walked the dog . <1> how long was your walk ? everyday i walk three miles . <0> i walk as far as the dog wants to go . probably 1 mile . <1> what else do you like to do ? <0> i go to church every sunday .
<0> i usually feel mad when am not payed on time <1> You should be. You should be paid on time for your hard work. <0> Its honestly pretty silly.. I have enough disappointments in my life with my kids, I don't need my employer to disappoint me, too.. lol <1> Trust me, I completey understand. <0> That's awesome.  Its ok, I know they will get it all straightened out (my job, not my kids.. they're a lost cause :P ) <1> My kids are a lost cause too! Lol <0> So.. outside of dealing with your lost cause kids, what else do you get up to in your free time? <1> Free time? What's that? Kidding. I like to just relax at home and listen to music. <0> Me too. What type of music do you like to listen to?
<0> ok other than my debts . <1> my life is great , i'm so happy i'm gonna be a father <0> Congratulations! But, do you think this country is the best to have a kid? <1> I don't know if its the best, but I think it is better then most. <0> Good point! At least we have an awesome national park system. <1> We certainly do! Do you have a favorite? <0> Acadia <1> oh I love it there. I went once as a little kid.  <0> Lucky you! I love the wild sea at Maine <1> Do you live around there? <0> I used to live in Boston, so I visited a few times.
<0> So I kind of ate the last piece of pizza that we had and I didn't know Tom wanted it... Feeling kinda bad. <1> I don't think you should feel bad,  you didn't know!
<0> I'm so not looking forward to tomorrow. <1> Why not? What happens tomorrow? <0> I have to talk to a large group at work tomorrow.  <1> Don't let it worry you too much. Just make sure you organize everything you need to present and remember to speak loudly and clearly! You can do it!
<0> I love the look of a Ferrari!  Are you into them? <1> Yes, they are a top notch Italian sports car manufacturer located in Maranello.  <0> Maranello?  Is that the city in Italy? <1> Yes, it's a town located in northern Italy. <0> When was Ferrari created and was it always a supercar? <1> The company was founded by Enzo Ferrari in 1939, and has always built race cars, as it is out of Alfa Romeo's race division. <0> I did not know the two were related!  Is it still owned by the Ferrari family? <1> Yes it is.

<0> I working to save enough money to take my wife on a vacation to Vermont next year. I hope I can save enough. <1> I hope you can too. How is it going? <0> I'm about half way there. I want to save enough to rent a cottage on one of the lakes up there so I still have a ways to go. <1> That's great! I have faith that you can do it. <0> yea,thanks

Yes, I do have a job as well <1> Thank you and that is great. I was hired as a security guard and I really enjoy the job. <0> That's great! What do you like about your job? <1> I work around kids all day and it's great. They are amazing kids they just need someone to relate and talk with. <0> Kids can be pretty fun! I also like talking to them. I enjoy talking about books. <1> Really! What books exactly? <0> I like graphic novels. I'm always searching for blogs where I can share my opinion about books I like. Do you enjoy books? <1> Yes, I do enjoy books as a matter of fact books on the solar eclipse. I'v been obsessed since I saw one when  I was 8.
<0> I felt so bad when I had to board my dog while I was on vacation. It made me feel like a bad dog mom!  <1> Aww,  I know that can be hard,  but you can't be too hard on yourself.  Sometimes you don't have a choice. <0> I know. She was so excited when we came home though which made us feel a bit better.  <1> Absence makes the heart grow fonder. <0> Especially when one has been away for awhile. 
<0> Have you ever been to Las Vegas?  <1> yes,  several times.The place is magical.
<0> A baker is someone who bakes and sometimes sells breads, do you know any bakers? <1> Yes i do. I am actually a baker. I love to bake cakes all the time <0> Since you are a baker you must work at a bakery! What a coincidence! <1> Yes it is. Do you bake at all? <0> I don't really but since grains have been a staple food of humanity for millennia it is a very old activity, I should really learn. <1> yes, you should. it is very easy and fullfilling. alot of people are intimidated by it, but its easy <0> Yeah I'm not really intimidated, I've just never gotten around to it. Some large households in Rome normally had their own bakers. What is your favorite thing to bake? <1> It would be a toss up between cheesecakes and my Garlic and herb biscuits.
<0> Jazz music is so fun to listen to! <1> I enjoy Jazz also. Jazz is pretty much America's classical music. <0> Yeah, it's so creative and is the result of blended cultures <1> I love the polyrhythms and improvisation. Also the swing and blues influences. <0> There's so much diversity in jazz, it's great! <1> It's probably so great because it originated in African American communities in New Orleans.
<0> I was thinking about my old neighborhood <1> Memories.. what state? 
<0> hi , my mom is a dentist , do you like the dentist office ? <1> i hate the dentist ! i work at the nursing home <0> that is cool , i'm trying to find a good job in the area , restaurant business <1> that would be good ! are you married ? <0> no but my sister is though , she's my older sister <1> how old ? my wife just recently left me with my children <0> On holiday?
<0> My son is getting pretty good at playing the drums. I always wish I learned how to play an instrument, but never had the courage to. Glad that I motivated him to play and very happy that he's actually getting pretty decent. <1> That's awesome, I'm with you, I always wished I continued to learn to play the guitar.  It's always a nice skill to have. <0> Are there any other hobbies you enjoy? <1> Yeah! I like to play tennis <0> That's cool! For exercise, I prefer to run <1> Running is also good warm-up!, who is your favorite player <0> Do you mean tennis or running? <1> In Tennis? <0> John McEnroe was always funny to watch. Especially when things didn't go his way <1> Ohh! cool guy <0> So, what do you do for work?
<0> I consider myself to be rather high-brow since I enjoy tasting expensive wines. <1> I like tasting wine too, but it doesn't have to be expensive. I just think the sensory examination of any wine is cool.   <0> I agree, but wasting money on expensive ones makes me feel better about myself. <1> Well, maybe you should start referring to yourself as a sommelier! They are professional wine tasters.  <0> Perhaps I should. I usually avoid labelling myself but in this case it might be appropriate!  <1> Sommeliers usually work in fine restaurants and specialize in all aspects of wine and how wines match with foods. 
<0> hi how are you , i'm from a small area , where are you from ? <1> hi there i'm from america but my family moved down to south america <0> cool , i lives in america all my life , i live in a small town <1> i used to live in minnesota <0> are there many lawyers there ? i'd love to be a lawyer <1> uh i've no idea <0> i would love to move to a big city and become a lawyer <1> ok sure i want to make computer like my dad used to <0> that is great , please tell me more interesting things <1> i had a friend named noah we were friends from ever since we met at 1
<0> I love pasta if I could eat it everyday I would the noodles and flour taste just gets me I'm a starchy kind of girl lol. <1> I love mac and cheese. Any kinda carb really lol. <0> How about dumplings I love homemade dumplings with chicken, potatoes and fresh vegetables.  <1> I like them when they are cooked the right way. I don't like them dry. I wish I could make them.  <0> I totally agree some people like theirs fried I prefer mines in a creamy sauce boiling, simmering and steaming to get all the flavors lol. <1> Yes that's how I like them also. I've never had them fried. <0> I have once at this restaurant they just add banku and kenkey and roll the dough into little balls and deep fry them.  <1> I've never heard of that, what is it?
<0> I hate taking the but,  today I was late to my stop and got there just as it drove away.... <1> Oh,  the bus? Yeah I bet that was a little embarrassing. Sorry to hear that. I take my car for granted. Maybe you will get one someday. <0> I drove my parents' old car for a little,  and i definitely took that for granted until it broke down lol. I'm trying to save up,  I hope I get one too. <1> Well,  keep working at it. It's a process. 
<0> I love Red, it is my favorite color. <1> I love red as well! I have heard red is a predator color <0> It has a wavelenght that starts at 625 nanometres. <1> That is really interesting, I know sports cars are best in red. <0> I like sports cars also, the term sports car was first used in London in 1919. <1> I never knew that, Do you know anything else about the color red? <0> It is a primary color in the RGB color mode. <1> That my bad, how I never knew that all this while.
<0> Yes, I have heard of it but do not know much about it.  What movies  have they produced? <1> I'm not too sure, but I know some stars that became big from this studio, like Rosalind Russell and Glenn Ford. <0> That's true! My brother in law runs a major hollywood studio - I only know information about his. Do you have a favorite type of movie?  <1> I really like comedies if they're well done, but a lot of them leave me wanting more. Dramas are good. <0> Do you have a favorite comedy movie?
<0> I like those! When were they first manufactured? <1> 1962. The original Mustang was a two seater concept car. <0> Cool, I like the 65, what is your favorite year <1> My favorite year was the 1968 Chevrolet. I real diamond. <0> Nice, I like those too, I also like 65-67 GTO <1> Yea, they are the bomb. My uncle have one and its a pleasure to drive. <0> Cool, Ive never driven one, I like old cars, so many I would love to own <1> Yea me too, but my budget is tight and obviously can't afford them all!

<0> My bank has called me three times a day ever since I applied for a mortgage. It's been a week and they show no signs of slowing down. <1> So are they telling you good news? <0> Not yet. I just filled out the prequalification online. I haven't officially applied yet. <1> Oh okay. Well hopefully they give you a chance to breathe and decide what you want to do.
<0> Do you watch Masterchef? <1> I have a few times, my mom is really into cooking shows, so I watched them a lot growing up, and still catch a few now and then. <0> They are so great I love to see them compete and the food be looking so good.  <1> I wish I could cook like that. They put me to shame.
<0> After working for years at a job I didn't like,  and struggling in school,  I found a new job that coincides with my Major. <1> I am so happy for you! All of your hard work paid off!
<0> I was watching an old movie and when it came to the sad part it made me cry. <1> Wow, you are sentimental i guess!! <0> A bit yeah. Do you like movies? <1> I do I love movies. I mostly like documentaries though. What is your favorite genre of movies? <0> rom-coms. Although I like documentaries too <1> That's cool, what's your favorite rom-com movie?
<0> I used to work outside of the home. It was difficult finding reliable child care. <1> Do you have children? Child care is an action or skill looking after children by a day care center, nannies or baby sitters. <0> I do have children. Two boys. How about you? <1> I don't but it is important to understand now. Early child care is equally important and often overlooked in child development. <0> Yes, it's definitely better to have young children in a place that will aid in their social and intellectual development. <1> That's so true. And daycare is typically an ongoing service during specific time periods like when you need to work. <0> I wish there were more commercial daycares open for those that have to work third shift. Unfortunately, those are few and far between. <1> Daycares are significantly under resourced and really require additional funding and support to meet needs like yours.
<0> So tonight I am seeing my favorite band for the first time ever. I have been a big fan for a while now. <1> Awesome, do you plan to go early to try and get autographs? <0> Nah it's pretty cold I don't think i'll wait afterwards <1> Oh. Its still hot here. I like to get autographs for my sports bar and hang them up <0> you have a sports bar?  <1> Yes. I am a small business owner. It is fairly popular <0> That's awesome <1> ya . it is a lot of fun . what kind of music do you like ? <0> I'm a fan of country what about oyu
<0> what kind of birds are you seeing? <1> There are many kinds of parrots and toukons. I love watching them recreationally. I'm not an ornithologist or one who does it for a living.  <0> I agree but I do enjoy watching the birds on the weekend. What do you do for fun? <1> I wish I enjoyed watching birds. I wish I enjoyed doing anything. <0> I also like to read horror books. Do you read certain types of books?
<0> I have brown hair,What's your hair type? <1> I have blue hair, and my hair type is 4A <0> Brown hair is characterized by higher levels of the dark pigment eumelanin and lower levels. <1> That's cool I didn't knoow that. I do know that blue dyes have stronger ions, which makes it harder  to remove. <0> They are natural  dyes natural dyes are vegetable dyes from plant sources—roots, berries, bark, leaves, and wood—and other biological sources. <1> Oh okay that is cool, so our hair are kind of like plants? <0> Sure, it would interest you to know that in China ,dyeing with plants, barks and insects has been traced back more than 5,000 years.  <1> I think they also do that in India too! <0> The French word for brunet", which is a diminutive form of "brun" meaning "brown/brown-haired"?,  <1> Oh wow how interesting! 
<0> I am still shocked my husband bought tickets to the concert. <1> What concert is it? Are you excited to go? <0> Super excited to see Taylor Swift! He knew I was a fan. <1> OH MY GOD,  I'm so jealous,  she isn't coming to my city this time. You're gonna have a great time <0> yes . i think i will have  great time. why are you jealous ?
<0> I have not. <1> I work daily with the practical application of law and legal theories. It's a lot of fun.  <0> It depends on the cases! I work with not very fun cases <1> you have to be really logical to be able to apply the legal theories <0> yes, very cold and not emotionally involved <1> I love watching the legal shows - and try to figure out who is guilty
<0> i listen to a ton of music , honestly . it is my main pasttime <1> that is cool . i like art <0> You do? Who is your favorite artist? <1> I dont really play favorites. I like variety, since im actually a middle school art teacher <0> Awesome! I always loved Degas when I was younger since I took ballet. <1> I dont know much about ballet to be honest. <0> I danced for over 10 years, but it's not my favorite genre of dance. A great base, but too strict. <1> I suppose that makes sense. Also, the differences in dances around the world is something that intrigues me. So many cultures <0> dancing has been part of me i can't imagine life without dance
<0> I found an abandoned cat in an alleyway yesterday. <1> What did you do to it?
<0> I am so happy with my life right now! <1> Yeah? That's a good thing! What's going on in your life right now? <0> Not much, I am just happy <1> I'm happy for you! Everyone deserves to be excited about life. <0> They do. Are you? <1> What do you do for a living?

<0> I bake cakes when I am sad or stressed out. <1> The most common baked item is bread. Do you bake other things besides cakes? <0> I like to bake cupcakes sometimes. <1> Baking is traditionally performed by women in the home, but men in bakeries and restaurants. You could have a successful career in baking. <0> Im not that good but I do try to do the fancy cakes you see on Pinterest. <1> The art of baking is a fundamental skill. 
<0> I can't go more than a day and a half without taking a shower. Thank goodness for nature giving us the idea for showers, through waterfalls! <1> When did we make the first shower? <0> The ancient greeks are the earlier known "modern type" shower users. before that it was pouring buckets on your head LOL. <1> What are modern showers usually made of? <0> Besides the shower head that sprays water. The real MVP of showers are the aqueducts and sewage systems leading back to the greeks that I mentioned above. The pipes (lead in the greek days) that pump water in and out to the shower are really what make the shower possible  <1> It seems that the Greeks really pushed the shower forward into the future. <0> Yes, and I am thankful haha. The showers of those days were similar to locker shower rooms that we use today. They even had a bar to hang their clothing on! <1> I am not sure I care about showers
<0> I remember the first I went to a theme park.  I had been planning on the way there not to go on any roller coasters,  but just being there changed my mind quickly. <1> Oh man,  I can relate,  that feeling of anxiety before you get there really turns around when you get caught up in the moment
<0> i think i will lose my tooth, i am afraid <1> Whys that?! is it rotting out? <0> No it just hurts and can't get in the dentist for some time. <1> I'm sorry to hear that.  Tooth pain is something awful to have to deal with. <0> Yes it is but I will be fine, just one of those things. Speaking of tooth pain, do you have halloween plans? <1> I plan to hide in my basement with my two boxers and watch scary movies. <0> Oh fun! My mom has a boxer. I am taking my little girl trick or treating. <1> Do you live somewhere with lots of trick-or-treaters? It sounds like fun. <0> No I live in the country so you have to drive in town <1> Oh yes, I used to live in the country when I was little and I remember having to drive in for trick-or-treating.
<0> Ive been cooking pasta dishes all my life and some call me the pasta expert, Would you like to learn the way of cooking pasta?  <1> Yes, please tell me more about the art of cooking pasta. <0> Well first its very important to know that pastas are divided into two groups, dried ("pasta secca") and fresh ("pasta fresca"). And both have a entire different taste.  <1> That seems like an important thing to know. What else should I know? <0> Well pasta originated as an Italian cuisine food from Italy, So if you want the best pasta you have to visit Italy.  <1> That seems reasonable, is there regional differences in pasta cooking in Italy? <0> Well not really but pasta is a staple food of talian cuisine, It dates back to 1154 in Sicily. Most Italian pasta is as good though.  <1> That is quite a long history.

<0> I'm trying to transition my dog into not sleeping in my room.  I know he wants to be by me and I can hear him whining and scratching at the door some nights <1> That must be hard to do,  he wants to be beside you. He is going to miss you. <0> I know.  It's tough to hear but he needs to be a little more independent and sleep in his own bed too! <1> Yes he needs to so you would have to ignore him at nights. <0> Ok, I plan on doing that tonight.

<0> Have you ever thought about red foods? Do you know what makes them red? <1> Well I know that iron oxide gives mars a red tint so maybe something to do with that. <0> It's much worse than that actually. The dye Red 40 is actually made from crushed red beetles. My daughter, who is vegetarian, found that out. <1> I did not know that, is that when you don't eat any meat like chicken or steak? <0> Yes, but as she has learned more, I have also. Gelatin in foods (Jello) is made from boiled animal bones. I'm not vegetarian, but even I limit red foods and gelatin now. <1> I understand. I like red sky at sunset. It comes from rayleigh scattering.

<0> Have you ever been to Niagara Falls?  Have you ever been to Niagara Falls?  That's the name for three waterfalls that straddle the international border between Canada and the United States <1> I didn't know it was three different ones. No I haven't ever been  there. <0> There's lots to see there, besides the falls.  There's observation towers, high-rise hotels, souvenir shops, casinos and theatres.  I love the casino! <1> Sounds like fun. It's a national park around it isn't it.  <0> I'm not sure!  But I do know that  more than six million cubic feet of water goes over the crest of the falls every minute. <1> I accidentally went down a small one one time and it almost killed me, so stay far away from the edge, the power of moving water is enormous.

<0> It is a shame how many people are obese nowadays. <1> I really feel for those obessed,is a medical condition in which excess body fat has accumulated to the extent that it may have a negative effect on health. <0> Do you know the percentage of people that are obese in America right now? <1> Well im not a statistician,but People are generally considered obese when their body mass index (BMI), a measurement obtained by dividing a person's weight by the square of the person's height, is over , with the range <0> Do you know the main causes of obesity? <1> Obesity is most commonly caused by a combination of excessive food intake, lack of physical activity, and genetic inherited <0> I wonder how many obese people could get better if they really worked towards it. <1>  Obesity and walking describes how the locomotion of walking differs between an obese individual and a non-obese individual and a non-obese individual  <0> I never realized that being obese could change something as simple as walking. <1> It can be devastating for someone to be inflicted with obesity, there are many issues that accompany it

<0> Ugh,  my cat keeps climbing up the curtains in my room. <1> That's the worst.  Is it damaging the curtains too much? <0> Yeah,  he's tearing them up. I really wish he'd stop.
<0> Last week we were at an amusement park and I cant believe my little brother got on the roller coaster with us. He's usually afraid of heights. <1> Oh man I would have terrified I hate being up so high. He sounds really brave! <0> I know,  he usually never goes on dangerous rides. <1> Did he go on anymore after that?
<0> The most common thing most people bake is bread. You'd think it was cookies or cake. Do you bake? <1> I can bake, but I don't do it very often anymore.  We only eat bread made with almond flour and so I don't do it very often. <0> I love using almond flour. Theres four grains that dominated in nordic countries. do you know what they are? <1> I do not, what are they? <0> Wheat barley rye oats <1> Interesting - although I hear that the ancient grains aren't anything like the grains today. <0> Not at all. I love to stick with sprouted bread instead.  <1> Almond flour works for us because it's lower in carbs.  But it definitely has a different texture.
<0> My entire family and I pretty much all have brown hair. I don't know how strong of a gene it is but I'm happy I have it! <1> Yes there is lot of brown hair in my family too, and after all it is the second most common hair color after black hair.. <0> I had no idea that was a fact. I can definitely believe it though. Not a personal fan of black hair.  <1> People with brown hair are often referred as brunette.  That comes from the French term of brun, meaning brown. <0> There is another thing I learned. That's real interesting. Are there any similar synonyms for other colors?  <1> Not that I know of.  But another interesting fact about brown hair is that its strand are thicker than those of fair hair, but not as much as red hair.
<0> Hi there. I have a lot of different favorite movie genres, but alien invasion is one of my all time favorites. <1> Oh, I've never seen that. What's it about? <0> I'm speaking in general terms, I hadn't really named one. The War of the Words is good. <1> Oh, gotcha. I didn't realize alien invasion was a movie genre. <0> I suppose it's a sub-genre. The War of the Worlds is a 2005 movie. <1> I think I remember that. I'm not into that genre so much. I prefer comedies or dramatic shows. <0> Do you have a favorite comedy? Lots of humor sometimes in science fiction movies.  <1> I do. I enjoy Rushmore. I am not a science fiction fan.

<0> My dog sheds so much I have to vacuum my room practically every 4 days if I don't want little tufts of fur everywhere. <1> I love puppies! But they definitely are a lot of work in terms of their hair. <0> You're right. I'm just so irritated,  even if it isn't his fault and I love the big goof. <1> I understand. Our puppy sheds a ton too and he isnt even that hairy of a dog <0> What is your dogs name?

The Caroline on Broadway is one the most establish and popular comedy clubs in the US. You should try and get there some time! <1> I would love to! Why is it so popular? What's so special about ti <0> Well, I think mostly because many of the top headliner in the U.S. have performed there like Louis C.K., Jay Leno, Bill Kick etc. You like any of them? <1> I LOVE Louis C.K.!!! He is so freaking hilarious. I love his jokes about his kids and ex wife lol <0> Haha yes me to. His self depreciating and shock humor is amazing. I think he was on SNL a few time too.

<0> I worked really hard for a promotion at work and I ended up not getting it. <1> That is a shame! I'm sorry to hear that. If you really like you job then just keep working hard. I am sure they will recognize your efforts pretty soon. <0> It is okay. I will find another job. <1> If you feel ready for a promotion then, yeah, time to look further afield then. I am going to start looking when both my kids are at school. <0> How is your job market? I live in New York so mine is pretty good and leaves me some room for a career switch <1> I don't know because I have never planned on looking for another job.

Apparently the US and europe have similar rates of twin birth - 9 to 16 per 1000 lives. <1> Wow I had no idea the rate was so low, do you know what kind of different twins are possible? I think fraternal is one kind for instance. <0> Yes, there are a couple of types.

Do you like to bake? <1> I don't think I have enough skill to bake yet, but maybe would like to try <0> If you want to try something easy, start with bar cookies, you can take the ingredients for chocolate chip cookies and bake them in a pan for bar cookies. <1> That reminds me of how the chocolate chip cookie was first created in 1938 by Ruth Graves <0> How did that happen? <1> She randomly decided to put bits of chocolate into a normal cookie! <0> Did it become popular right away? <1> I believe Ruth kept the recipe a secret for many years after. <0> Did she sell or publish the recipe eventually? <1> Yes, but she died before she could be accredited for the invention of the choco chip cookie.
<0> I really love the color red! It is so vibrant! <1> Yes it is, it's actually my favorite color! Different shades of red are super interesting when mixed.

Red is usually the color of pills that are stimulants. <0> Oh I had no idea. I did know that red cars are more popular so they tend to be higher priced! <1> Absolutely, red and other colors can be highly influential for people. I'm sure you've heard that thing about red cars being pulled over more often. <0> Yes! It is crazy how colors can be so influential! <1> Makes sense. I mean, after all, it's literally in our blood. The hemoglobin in blood is what gives it its red color.

<0> Yes, I liked the small quaint feeling of growing up there. <1> Is that true the license plates carry the state motto, "Live Free or Die"? <0> Sort of, a specific state may have that, doubt it, but every state has something different. I know New Hampshire doesn't, I grew up there. <1> What was on that plate?  <0> The leaves fall where they may.  <1> aww that's pretty, would make a nice tattoo quote.

I'm just going to miss her. <0> Do you have anyone close to you to lean on for support? <1> I really don't feel like reaching out. I just want to curl up with some ice cream and be alone for a while. <0> You know what, that's totally ok.

Hide and seek Nerf was awesome. <1> I have never played hide and seek Nerf. I mostly just stood there and shot my brother with my gun.  <0> One time we put toothpicks in the end of nerf arrows and shot each other.  Not advisable! <1> I remember holding my brother down and using my N-strike Elite gun and just shooting him until he yelled for our parents.  <0> Classic!  I was the younger brother so in that situation I would have probably been the one being held down.  As a matter of fact he used make me watch scary movies.  I still hate clowns! <1> I remember making my younger brother watch the Scream movie back in 1996 <0> Scream is so classic.  Thinking of that movie just makes me think of how media is so saturated now and all movies seem the same to me.  They felt more original back then. <1> Yeah, you are so right about that. I do not enjoy the movies anymore.

It use to be brown, but I am older now. <0> Oh thats cool! so its a good thing that you still have hair, that is one of my worst fears to lose my hair <1> I was blessed with very think hair.  Is your hair thick? <0> Yes it is very thick thanks be to god! im scared because in Venezuela 60% of the people is bold by the age of 30, it must be the way they eat! <1> Brown hair is a very common hair color.  Is your hair long? <0> Yes it is common, im thinking on letting it grow but it is not socially acceptable in most places like middle east, so i have to be carefull traveling there <1> Oh wow, I did not know that. That is so enforcing.
<0> I was so annoyed earlier - went back to get my car after doing my shopping and someone had hit it and driven off! <1> That wasn't nice. I hope they caught them. <0> No unfortunately not.  There were no cameras in the carpark and no one saw anything.  So i am left with the bill.  I hope karma gets them eventually though. <1> That sucks,  how much is it? <0> I don't know yet, I'm still waiting on the estimate from the shop.
<0> I'm spending my first summer in Massachusetts. It's a lot hotter than I expected it to be. <1> Is it really? How hot is it there? <0> The hottest it got was 99 degrees. It has been in the mid 80s mostly,  but I was expecting cooler weather in New England.
<0> I have brown hair, but it's pretty light. So light that sometimes under the right lighting it looks blond! <1> Well, brown hair certainly varies from blond to almost black: which is what mine was until I turned gray! <0> Is it weird that I'm a little jealous? I mean, I don't want to go full grey yet, but I'm about to be 30 and I'm hoping for some nice salt & pepper in the beard soon. <1> Apparently levels of melanin can cause hair color to change.  Hopefully you will get some "unpigmented hair" in your beard! <0> I'm a little bit more worried about the pigmentation on my skin. Feeling pretty pale. I need to spend some more time outside. <1> Yes my son is fair complexioned as well, and has light skin.  He either burns or stays Casper.
<0> I just got tickets to see my favorite band at Red Rocks Amphitheater. Seeing a show there is on my bucket list <1> That's awesome, I haven't been to a concert in ages. Who is the band? <0> Nine Inch Nails. I'm stoked. <1> Oh that's great - I'm a big fan too, especially Hurt! Much better than the Jonny Cash version... <0> Oh yeah, I agree. It should be a good time. Tickets weren't cheap though, but I don't care! <1> Yeah I can imagine! How much did you have to pay? <0> $200 for upper-level seats. Tickets closer were like $400. That's crazy. <1> 200! for a band that isnt that great that is crazy!
<0> My grandma teached me to do it, now all of my friends ask me to do sewing for them :D <1> Thats awesome, sewing can be seen in so many generations since theyve been around since the first industrial revolution. <0> Yes, it is nice to have a connection through my family's generations. What hobbies do you have? <1> I am a cyclist but I also enjoy fishing  <0> Oh, an outdoors person. Good for you. My outdoor activity is gardening. Do you fish freshwater? <1> Not since I was little, I only do saltwater fishing now.  <0> Do you have a boat, or fish from shore? <1> I fish off of a pier. I cant swim so a boat is out of the question for me.  <0> Ah, I see. Fishing seems so relaxing and the people who fish, whom I've meet are always so nice. What kind of fish do you catch? <1> Catfish mostly, sometimes white trout, but my best catch was a shark. Not like a huge one but one of the small kinds.  <0> Wow, that shark must have been hard to reel in?
<0> My mom brought me my favorite salad and cheesecake yesterday.  <1> That sounds delicious! How nice of her! <0> Yes it was such a surprize when she walked in the door with the food, I had no clue she was buying food. <1> I LOVE cheesecake. A piece a cheesecake a good book and a glass of wine sounds like a relaxing evening. <0> My favorite cheese cake has to be reeses, I enjoy my peanut butter cups. <1>  haha! Me too! I usually hide them from my kids so that I actually get some if I have them at the house. <0> Its always nice to sit back and gossip online with some peanut butter cups to be honest. <1> True Story! The ones with the reeces pieces are going to be the death of me. Im an RN so I know the way to the hospital. lol <0> Always suchs after eating a ton of them and getting the candy blues and feeling very bad. <1> Yeah.. I tend to eat them early in the day before I workout.  I don't feel as bad if I do that. What's your occupation? <0> I am a artist, so I have plenty of time to eat all th candy. The only down side, no woman seems to want to kiss a artist very sadly. <1> Haha! I don't know any artist so I don't know if I can agree. It must be nice making your own schedule. Not having to clock in seems less,stressful <0> It makes all the difference in the world. Do you want to get drink later?
<0> Red is one of my favorite colors, it's also the color at the end of the visible light spectrum. <1> i love red! I feel like it's the color of passion and love <0> I agree with that, it also has a lot of different hues, there's yellow-tinged scarlet and vermillion all the way to bluish-crimson, how cool. <1> i also love blue. it's so calm and peacful <0> It's crazy how colors can influence perceptions that aren't obvious, like the taste of food. <1> it <0> Yeah, it's called color psychology, it refers to the study of how hues are a determinant of human behavior. <1> sorry last time i pressed enter by accident. It is pretty cool. i've never heard of color psychology <0> Well you were talking about it without realizing it when you mentioned red, some men even report that red outfits enhance female attractiveness! <1> That's pretty neat. I wonder what else color affects.
<0> Baking is such a fun passtime, plus you get baked goods when they're done. <1> Baking is a lot of fun, I really like making bread, it's lots of work but well worth it! <0> Bread is one of my favorite things to bake too! <1> I wish I could call myself a baker, that would be an awesome job <0> If it made more money than being an engineer than I would bake forever. <1> Well I am sure with the industrialization of baking, they hire fewer people and use machines in huge factories <0> It's sad that less bread is made in a less fake, manufactured way. <1> It is sad, most food we eat is so processed, It is not hard to use an oven and bake food in it <0> That's fair, pretty much everything we have has preservatives and other chemicals for better or worse. <1> We've got to take a lot of care to prevent excessive chemical intake.
<0> i love country music , country concerts on the weekend <1> i love taylor swift , she's my favorite <0> my two dogs love her <1> do you like eating out ? i do <0> yeah , i do after i work on my vintage cars <1> sounds fun ! i just turned 24 . <0> very cool . i teach music and i'm in a band <1> Nice, so am I! We sing country songs mostly.
<0> i have brown hair <1> Me too. Its the second most common human hair colour. <0> What is responsible for human hair coloring and brown hair in particular  <1> Its the higher level of a dark pigment eumelanin and lower levels of the pale pigment pheomelanin <0> Hmm That is amazing to hear. What type of hair color do you have yourself? <1> I have brown as I have stated earlier. Brown varies from light brown to an almost black colour. Actually black hair is the most common colour in the world. <0> I love black hair on people as well. But i prefer mine to be brown. So i am perfect the way i am
<0> My wife and I are going out to one of my favorite restaurants tonight. <1> That sounds fun. Is it a special occasion? <0> Not really,  just felt like going out. I'm thinking about ordering something I haven't had before,  but.... I don't know. I'm weird about trying new foods. <1> I understand. Sticking with what you know seems safer. <0> I enjoy trying new foods during special occasions.
<0> Chronic fatigue syndrome is a medical condition characterized by long-term fatigue, do you have chronic fatigue? <1> I do not think so, but I certainly would not like to have it! <0> yeah diagnosis is based on the presented symptoms. <1> I hope I never have those symptoms, I like to be full of energy, but when I do not get much sleep I get very fatigued <0> Yeah and it doesn't go away in fact no medications have been approved in the United States. <1> That is not good, but I guess its better than approving of harmful ones in a way, becasue they would approve ones that work <0> Yes and no, if you had it I'm sure you would want medication for it, there is tentative evidence that supports the use of rintatolimod. <1> I would try whatever gave me a chance of becoming well again if I was that sick!
<0> I'm very scared of the afterlife <1> Me too,  it's so hard not knowing what to expect. <0> And we do not even know if we have an afterlife. <1> Right,  no one truly knows until they get there,  so scary. <0> I am very sure that my afterlife will be great.
<0> Niagara Falls has over six million cubic feet of water going over the falls every minute!! That's insane. <1> I have never been to upstate New York, but I would like to. <0> There are 19.85 million people that live in the whole state, and I've never even visited Manhattan or Long Island, much less upstate new york or anywhere else! <1> I have been to New York City, there was so many people, it was crazy! <0> I would imagine! It's super ethnically and culturally diverse, all sorts of people live there! <1> My city is very diverse due to the large college that we have.
<0> Hi, I like jazz music. Do you like jazz music? <1> Yes, i like it because Jazz is a music genre that originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans, United States <0> Yes, it came from both blues and ragtime. <1> And because of that, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. <0> Yes, who is your favorite jazz singer? <1> That would be Sarah Lois Vaughan.She had one of the most wondrous voices of the 20th century."

<0> I would love to live in Alaska although I am not that familiar with living conditions in the state. <1> I know they have pretty brutal winters, that's for sure. <0> I don’t think I could take brutal, <1> I've been to Maine, and it's pretty cold there too <0> The coldest I’ve ever felt is Connecticut. Cold is nice, freezing, not so much. <1> I heard  same about Connecticut...
<0> I really like the new football coach. <1> I like football, who are you talking about? what team? <0> Oh, sorry! My son's team the Redding Falcons, they are doing so great this year! <1> That's great to hear! A coach can make all the difference. I play on my high school football team.  <0> That's great!! What position do you play? My son's team is playing Greenwich at the coast, it'll give me time to go to the shore!  <1> Are we talking about the same kind of football? I am from the united states and I know that what we call football is different than other countries. <0> Oh yes! My son thinks he'll be the next Tom Brady! I follow his wife Giselle on Insta, she collects Seashells like me, so we can connect over that! Teenagers! <1> Is your son planning to play football in college? <0> Yes, he hopes! He is 6'5" and has a nice spin on his pass! <1> How many touchdown passes has he thrown?
<0> I have super super dark brown hair most people think my hair is black <1> does your family also have dark hair - true black hair is a dominant genetic trait among people of all backgrounds and ethnicities <0> I know my mom is a red head, I never met my dad but my mom said his hair color was the same, and he was very light complected like myself and my mom <1> That's interesting because a darker person usually have more individual hair follicles on their scalp so they are darker.  Are you siblings the same? <0> I have 1 brother blonde and blue eyed <1> Is the blond yellowish color?  Very different than brown/almost black hair!  The 2 types of melanin: eumelanin and pheomelanin make up hair color.  <0> no it is very very blond, not a yellow color at all <1> I wonder if skin color has anything to do with it - skin pigmentation is also genetic from their birth parents.  <0> We are both very light complected, as well as both my parents, not sure where the dark hair came from as far as my dad goes, somewhere back in the genes I guess <1> Yes, it might be traceable to one of his ancestors
<0> I was shocked to see $200.00 included with the card. <1> Was it some fraudulent transaction posted on your account?

What do you like to watch? <0> I dont know , I prefere formula 1 or Nascar race
<0> What is your favorite number? <1> 7 is a cool number but i like 17 myself. <0> 7 is my favorite.  It's a powerful number. What do you like about 17? <1> I like that it isnt common and its my birthday day of the month, its a cool number. <0> 17 still has 7 in it so I like it too.  Do you have another favorite? <1> Besides the number 17? I like 8 too.
<0> No I didn't! That is so cool! I have said all I know about Scotch whiskey. Can you tell me even more? <1> I don't know a whole lot about Scotch whiskey but I know about Irish whiskey!  Irish Whiskey is made in Ireland! <0> I don't know anything about whiskey. Not a huge fan. I like tequila , what do you prefer to drink <1> I like captain Morgan,  The cocktail originated in the early 20th century! <0> very cool, I like rum as well I mostly drink beer, but I like rum for mixed drinks and tequila for shots <1> I like Vodka, but mixed with stuff to kill the taste, I hate beer though, it is nasty to me <0> I don't drink all that often anymore. I used to when I was younger, but now only coup[le times a month in social situations. 
<0> I think superman has to be one of the best super heroes alive. <1> I dunno, I think Batman was pretty good <0> I mean superman can fly and take a bullet to the eye and not flinch! <1> But Batman is the Caped Crusader! The Dark Knight! The world's Greatest DEtective! <0> He is amazing, and he has an awesome buttler,  I just think the flying aspect cant be beat. <1> Well he has his utility belt with the variety of gadgets at his disposal.

<0> I've always loved Ferrari's - the first one was built in 1940 - I bet that one goes for a pretty penny if it could be found? <1> It's an Italian car maker isn't it? <0> Yes it was, based in Maranello. <1> It is a racing car too I think. It's in the Formula one races I believe. <0> I'm not 100% on that, but I do know that all cars have to conform to the "formulas" set of rules. <1> The road cars have a really nice design I think. Some of the older ones, <0> They are rated as the world's most powerful brand by Brand Finance in 2014, so even the newer ones must pack a punch! <1> their designs are ugly
<0> hi there , i'm bob . <1> hi ! i'm andy . <0> i ended things with my boyfriend <1> really that is sad . i work as an elementary teacher . <0> nice , i am 18 now <1> great . my father was a teacher too so <0> did he hike like i do ? <1> no he did not . he and i enjoyed time in the beach . <0> i really like sunsets most <1> that is really amazing . i hope you do great . ahead .
<0> just chilling . watching netflix . so what are you reading ? <1> i am actually rereading 1984 . you familiar ? anything good on netflix ? <0> i am not familiar with that what is it about? <1> It is about the people's struggle with never ending war, constant government surveillance, and public manipulation. <0> cool <1> It really is. It makes you think so much about police who persecute individualism and independent thinking. <0> sound amazingly like today
<0> I love Snoop Dogg, are you a fan of his music? <1> Snoop has made a better living off of smoking Marijuana than Cheech and Chong ever did.  They don't get the respect they deserve, they were far ahead of their time. <0> Haha, you are definitely right about that. I like his song Gin and Juice, have you heard of it? <1> can't remember.  i just remember the song from "nice dreams', the one where they drove the ice cream truck that went; "mama talking to me try to tell me how to live, she can't tell me nothin cause my head is like a sieve". <0> I'm not familiar with that song. When was the Nice Dreams album released, if it was an album? <1> their second feature film in 1981.  "My basketball caoch done kicked me off the team; for wearing high heeled sneakers, and actin like a queen".   <0> Oh it's a movie? I'll have to check it out, do you know who else stars in it? <1> Yeah it's a movie. Other actors aren't that familiar to me
<0> I gained a lot of weight after my mom passed, Im geting obese but I was told it is a medical condition that I can get help for. <1> I'm sorry to hear that!  Have you tried limiting your calories and getting a bit of exercise? <0> I have, A few cases are caused primarily by genes, endocrine disorders and some just happen over time. <1> What sort of help were you considering?  I know people who have had surgery and are quite happy with the results. <0> I think I might get a gym membership, On average, obese people have a greater energy expenditure than their normal counterparts so I will have to work hard <1> A gym membership is a great idea!  You might consider getting a personal trainer to help you - he's be able to design a good workout for you!
<0> I love Wine tasting  <1> Which type of wine do you use? <0> Any wine of your choice can be used.  is the sensory examination and evaluation of wine. <1> What type do you prefer the most? <0> I love blue ray wine,  the practice of wine tasting is as ancient as its production <1> Oh I see, Whether it is good for your health

<0> My wife and I are trying to build a house,  and keep running into delays getting the permits. <1> That sounds very frustrating. <0> It is!  The guy at the city could care less if he helps us out. <1> Hopefully you'll able to get it all sorted out soon.  I'm sure when it's done it'll be a beautiful house. <0> The house is already done but without the proper permits.
<0> I really enjoy exercising and physical fitness.  Do you work out? <1> I do work out! And it helps me feel great through proper nutrition, moderate-vigorous physical exercise, and sufficient rest. <0> How often should I work out? <1> You should work out quite often, but not every day - it'll boost the immune system and helps prevent things sush as  as coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and obesity. <0> That is definitely a plus.  Why should I not work out every day?  Would it be bad for me? <1> You don't want to over work your muscles.  And being fit is the quality or state of being fit. <0> Yeah, I wouldn't want to overwork myself.  I do want to be fit and prevent disease and getting overweight.  Is it better to do cardio or weights? <1> Strength training is good - can provide significant functional benefits and improvement in overall health and well-being as well as  improved cardiac function! <0> High blood pressure is a problem in my family.  Will this help with that?

New hairstylist? <0> no,  same style from my barber who always cuts my hair,  for some reason he did a terrible job <1> That's odd.  I would've told him so and asked for my money back.  <0> i don't want to be rude
<0> Lets talk about red, Super stylish, and bulls love the color. <1> Alright, I  like the color red because it is the dominant wavelength and has a wavelength of approximately 625–740 nanometres. Is red your favorite color too?  <0> No I don't have favorites just my flavor of the week. You know how it is. <1> Right, Have you ever looked at mars? the insane amount of Iron oxide on it gives the red color to the planet, A lot of people thing its sand lol.  <0> Haha wow, only uneducated people would think it is sand. <1> A lot of others think that mars is the 6th planet from the Sun lol, It being the second-smallest planet in the Solar System you would think they would remember that.  <0> Yeah I mean the earth is 3rd so not sure how you would think we could go to mars and its the 6th

My husband is a huge fan though.  <0> What is your favourite cuisine? <1> I love pepperoni pizza. <0> who is your favourite band? <1> George strait. is my favortie singer <0> I love his songs as well.

<0> Hey! I love listening to music, specifically rap. One of my favorite rappers is Snoop Dogg.  <1> I don't know a lot about Snoop Dogg but I do know his career began in 1992 as he was discovered by Dr. Dre. <0> Really? That is interesting! I am a big fan of Dr. Dre as well.  <1> Yes, Dr. Dre is the current CEO of Aftermath Entertainment. <0> Have you ever heard of Dr. Dre's song with Snoop Dogg, "The Next Episode"? <1> I know it is a single which was released on July 4, 2000.
<0> The other day I made fish tacos and did nothing else all day but relax on the couch. <1> Bet that was a nice calming down. <0> Very. It was nice and chill and low pressure,  just how I like it.
<0> It's a beautiful day here today. The sun is shining. The birds are singing. The roads are quiet. <1> wow sounds great <0> Yeah it really it. It's chilly but that's how it should be on Halloween <1> Exactly! Halloween should be cold and spooky, <0> I hope we get a lot of trick or treaters. I never got to be the actress I wanted to be so I use that energy to spook the kids. <1> Do you live somewhere with lots of trick-or-treaters? It sounds like fun. <0> I live in a pretty busy, small city so we get a decent amount. How about you? <1> I live in a small town also. We have a huge skateboard park that is putting on a Halloween bash!
<0> words cannot describe how happy i am,  in 2 weeks time i will go and see my wife i am so joyful and exciting  <1> I am so happy for you! Why have you been apart for the past two weeks?
<0> cool , i like movies and their soundtracks . i am actually in a band . <1> what music do yo all play <0> Punky grungy stuff. <1> Nice, but I have never been into that type of music. To each his own, enjoy. <0> I also like anything from a good singer/songwriter. You know? <1> I do too.
<0> Jazz doesn't make any sense to me.  Is there any order to it at all? <1> I love Jazz music but didn't get it at first.  Its so nice to listen to with its combo of swing and blue notes. Its very versatile. <0> I don't even know what blues music is, what is that? <1> Its a genre of music that was started by African Americans in the Deep South. You should really check it out but its not for everyone.  Jazz is a bit more easy listening. <0> Jazz just sounds like a lot of noise to me which makes me think it is some sort of modern statement or something.  Is it a newer style of music? <1> Its not too old but the Jazz Age was in the 1920's. That's when it really started to be seen as a big form of musical expression.  I would start with some smooth Jazz to get used to it. Its easy listening. <0> Kenny G is the only jazz artist I really know.  Is Kenny G smooth jazz? <1> His music does have some Jazz elements and is definitely easy listening but he's really just a saxophonist more than anything else. But the saxophone is definitely part of Jazz!  So see, you like a form of Jazz. You are just missing the blues. <0> I didn't say I like Kenny G.  Listening to Kenny G makes my ears bleed and my brain go numb.
<0> hello from canada , how are you ? <1> hello i am from california . i am good and yourself ? <0> sunny california , never been there but have traveled a lot in the army . <1> oh should go to cali . i love living here . where have you travelled ?
<0> Yeah I went to a used car lot yesterday to check out a car I saw on the internet.  Not happy. <1> Ick. I've never heard of anyone having a really good experience with that. <0> Well I realzied that the owner had taken the pictures of the car from a large distance.  Up close it was very disappointing. <1> Ah,  I see. The classic photo trick. I understand why you would be upset about that. That's definitly why it's so important to go see before you buy <0> It is. I will always go to a reputable car dealer now that has been recommended to me by many friends and family.
<0> It took a long time to do it due to a lot of hardships in life, but my wife finally graduated from a masters program over the Summer. <1> Wow, wat is her degree in? <0> Anthropology. I know nothing about it.  <1> I see. Anthropology is broadly, the study of man. The term was coined in the Renaissance. <0> Yes. She may go into phycology. She enjoys human behavior studies.   <1> That is exciting!  I have a masters as well.  I love learning!   <0> I unfortunately do not. Im a hard worker. Do what needs to get done.   <1> That sounds like a nice balance. Do you enjoy your own work? <0>  Sometimes, it can be backbreaking but theres something about accomplishing a goal I like
<0> I took my daughter shopping today <1> That sounds like fun! It's great to spend time with our children. Did you have fun? <0> Yes, it was a little tiring. I love being able to spoil her, though! <1> I can imagine it's good to get to spend the day with your own children! Definitely needs its breaks though.  <0> For sure. What do you like to do for fun?  <1> I love walks in the forest that's right next to me, I'm not much of a city person. <0> Ooh, that's great. I love forests and trees! I paint a lot of trees, actually! <1> I especially like how the leaves turn colors. But what do you like to paint with? <0> Mostly acrylic, but some watercolor as well. Yes, I LOVE fall! <1> Fall is the most photogenic season. But my mother used acrylic too since it was developed in 1934. She's been happy ever since! <0> Wow, I didn't know that! Do you paint at all? <1> I dabble a bit, but I prefer to use pastels for my art despite the mess they make!
<0> Last night my GPS asked me to make a right down a dark and scary road.  <1> It's hard to trust a GPS. I have heard a lot of stories about people being steered the wrong way. Please tell me you didn't do it. <0> I was very nervous and doubting to do it. I actually did and it wasnt that bad <1> I am so glad that it didn't turn out bad for you. 
<0> Well i had spent the good part of a week organising the best weekend away with my hubby for our 10th wedding anniversary. Spa day,  great dinner,  concert and of course the parents were booked to mind the kids for the weekend.  However all did not go to plan... <1> Oh no,  what happened? Hopefully the whole weekend didn't get ruined! <0> Well unfortunately the day before we were due to go my little 2 year old daughter woke up covered in spots.  As the day went on more and more appeared and she had a roaring temperature.  We realised she had chickenpox.  She was feeling so miserable and of course all she wanted was her mummy and daddy.  It was a bit depressing and part of me was devastated but our weekend away was not to be.  Sure kids always come first dont they?!
<0> it is crazy . somehow i'm still overweight even though i run after them all day <1> it took me 2 years to lose any baby weight <0> I'm still working on it and my boy is 12. lol But I have found something that works for me now. <1> That's awesome to hear. Keep it up, it is an incredible work that I love always <0> I eat all the fruit and lo carb vegetables I want throughout the day and I have a small portion of meat with lunch. I'm losing 5 lbs a week. <1> Wow that´s really good. I don´t like vegetables, do you?
<0> The number of 7 is a really interesting number. <1> Well, I guess it could be! It's considered lucky for some people.  <0> Yeah a lot of people a superstitious about that. <1> Sailors have lots of superstitions that are specific to being a mariner. Do you know of any of those superstitions? <0> Yeah I think red sky at night, sailors delight is a sailor superstition right?
<0> I found some old school papers of mine <1> did it bring back a lot of old mermories?
<0> Do you like Jazz Music. I'm getting into it as I get older.  <1> I like it a lot since it's really relaxing to listen to. You can definitely tell that it came from the African-American communities in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in America. <0> Yes, I listen to it at night while I cook dinner. It helps me wind down from a stressful day.  <1> That sounds really nice! It makes sense that I like it since I like the blues and ragtime and they're all very similar. <0> What's ragtime? I've not herd of it. <1> It's music that is characterized by it's "ragged" rhythm. Jazz though is known as "America's classical music", which is really cool to me. <0> Wow, I'll have to check it out. But tonight is a classic Jazz night. <1> Maybe they will have a Ragtime Night.

I have never heard Anita Baker, but I know that her career spanned 1983-2002 <0> yes indeed. How do you feel about the Musical "All that Jazz?"
<0> My friend randomly brought me a cake to thank me for watching her dogs while she was away <1> yeah that was good to helping others. it was a go9d manner i loved it. <0> have you ever been to japan <1> Nope. Never been. You? <0> I went over the summer. Nice place to visit. The citizens are welcoming <1> Nice. There are some good violin players in japan that  I would like to learn from
<0> When I was out of work my car broke down and since it was my only car a friend of mine actually gave me his old car to replace it. It was such a nice gesture. <1> That was great of him!
<0> that sounds like a fun place to live ! <1> it is , but i'd rather stay in and read a good book <0> Do you not like the cold weather there? <1> I do, I just don't want to be out in it.  <0> I would love to spend the day indoors reading. Whats your favorite genre? <1> Any genre fiction really, mainly sci-fi, horror and magical realism. How about you? <0> Psychological thrillers are my favorite! <1> I love psychological thrillers, any recommendations? <0> My most recent read was The Silent Patient, highly recommend. <1> Do you have any others in the genre you could recommend to me?

<0> I love comedy club <1> I made my debut at Carolines on Broadway  <0> So how was the Comedy audition then? <1> It was great ,though was a bit nervous <0> I could only imagine the stage fright? <1> Interestingly! May celebrities you know today had performed there,like  Carolines, including Louis C.K., Paul Reubens, Jerry Seinfeld, Jay Leno, Bill Hicks, Andrew Dice Clay, Gilbert Gottfried, Joy Behar, Jon Stewart, Robin Williams, Colin Quinn, <0> I'm just not a fan of comedy in any form.
<0> I know the name but can't remember what he drew/draws. Do you know what he was known for? <1> Yes Peanuts cartoon strips. He had several movies for entertainment and advertising done with the gang. <0> Is that the one with with the yellow sponge guy? <1> No with Charlie Brown and Snoopy <0> Was snoopy a spie?
<0> Sounds like it! I've never tried dancing that much before. <1> You should! It has aesthetic and symbolic value which will make you appreciate life more. <0> I am a terrible dancer though. More of the "hairbrush as a mic" kind of dancing...  <1> i never have but would love to take some lessons ! <0> I wish I could. I have really bad knees. What else do you like to do? <1> I like to go to the gym and ride my bicycle.
<0> Have you ever felt guilty for sleeping all day? <1> Yes! I feel like the day escaped me. Have you done that recently? <0> Yes,  I am thinking to do it again today though.  <1> It is Friday,  that would be a nice way to start the weekend!
<0> Dog biscuit is a snack  that is used as a supplement for dogs <1> I give my dogs biscuit sometimes. How healthy are dog treats though?  <0> Judging by the fact that they are always well made, and  tend to be hard and dry, I would say they are healthy <1> I guess that makes sense. What other supplements exist to give to your dog?  <0> I'm not too sure but I like dog biscuits because  they come in a flat bone-shape. <1> Yes the little bone shape is actually pretty cute. My dog gets so excited to get them. What are dog biscuits even made of though? <0> You won't believe it if I tell you that some manufacturers of the biscuit thinks  clean the dog's teeth, promoting oral health. <1> Yes I think I've heard that before. Does it really clean dog's teeth?
<0> My husband really loves the Ferrari brand of sports car - do you have any preferences? <1> For sports cars i dont really have a strong preference, i think they all look really cool. sports cars i dont see alot. i livein a small town <0> Ferrari built their first car in 1940 - so they've been on the market quite a while - what kind of cars do you see in your town? <1> i see alot of older cars. you see a mix of nicer ones like theres some BMWs that drive around and some jaguars. What is your favorite car? <0> Although the Ferrari 1962 250 GTO is the most expensive car in history, my choice is probably a Jeep Wrangler. <1> im a jeep girl all the way! jeep stands for just empty every pocket. they can be very expensive. <0> My dad has TWO - but I like the basic Wrangler sport utility - top down and sun shining!!

<0> I love italian food especially Pasta which first was served in Sicily in 1154 <1> Italian food is delicious, what was the first pasta served? <0> There are over 310 diffeernt types of pasta known by over 1300 names, so its hard to know what was the first served <1> Oh wow that is a lot there.  What is the most popular type in Italy? <0> Cavatelli is known by 28 different names in Italy <1> Does Cavatelli look like spaghetti?
<0> Oh,  I am so sad that my family could not come and visit me. I miss them all so much. Why is life so busy for everyone these days? <1> I sure wish it wasn't. I live far from my family and they can't even make time for me to go to them. So I feel for you,  it is very sad.

I have done a lot of research on the company and hope to one day own my dream car. <0> We rode in one once.  To a funeral.  High class.  Was afraid to touch anything. <1> That is what is keeping me from purchasing one. My dog is my #1 sidekick and he sheds so that is a problem. <0> Dogs are man's best friend lol.  We're going to the opera next week.  Madame Butterfly.  For the 15th time. <1> That's nice. Will you be going there in a Bentley?
<0> I didn't like it, my team  lost during yesterdays match between England and Croatia <1> I was supporting England too,    <0> So bad,  let wait for the finals. <1> Who do you think will win the cup <0> I think that Croatia will win.

<0> I do not have much energy. I am having a  long-term fatigue and other symptoms that limits my ability to carry out ordinary daily activities. <1> Oh god buddy, i  think you are depressed <0> Yes it is a medical condition called Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) <1> Its CFS, Can you explain more about this. <0> The fatigue you experience is not  due to strenuous ongoing exertion and it is  not much relieved by rest neither was it due to a previous medical condition. <1> Ok, Due to what we are getting depression more. <0> Well all i know is that it is comparatively rare and we do not have a cure   with treatment being symptomatic. <1> We need more rest to and relive from the depression

<0> Isn't it nice when people bring you food,  when you've had a long day? <1> Oh for sure. I hate having to cook and do dishes after a long hard day
<0> Star Trek and Battle star Gallactica, not to mention Star Gate. <1> I grew up watching Star Gate.  I felt a special connection to it because it was filmed around Vancouver, British Columbia,Canada, where my family has a cabin.  <0> Oh wow, I drive up there all the time with work - beautiful part of the world! <1> definately ! star trek is a classic favorite of mine since childhood . <0> Yeah it's really good, although I have to say I do prefer the films... <1> I like the films but I love watching the series with my mom at home. Which Star Trek film is your favorite? <0> I think it would have to be the Wrath of Khan. How about you? <1> I have never seen it but I really enjoyed "Into Darkness", one of the latest movie. Have you seen it? <0> Yes I did like it, although a little to 'Hollywood'y for my tastes! <1> I agree with you on that. Movies like that always make me think on how scary the future might be one day. Do you feel the same way? <0> Yeah absolutely, although the future is already here - the truck I drive already feels like a space ship with all the new technology! <1> i never thought about it like that . i love your perspective ! <0> What do you do for work?
<0> I like to shop at Target. It's actually the second largest discount store in the US, next to Walmart. <1> I also love Target, they are so clean inside. <0> Yes, and items are a bit different. It used to be named Goodfellow Dry Goods back in 1902 when it was first opened, and went through a few more names until 1910 <1> So it officially became Target in 1910? <0> Well, the actual first Target opened in Minnesota in 1962, but the parent company was renamed Dayton Corporation in 1967. It's been a process! <1> How many Target stores are there in the USA? <0> I'm not sure, but they had some major public issues back in 2010 when there was a huge security breach for the customer's credit card data in Canada. But, the US Target's did better. <1> That is insane! I am so scared of scammers!
<0> I have brown hair and i love other people with brown hair <1> I have brown hair as well! it's the second most common hair color, after black hair  <0> where is it most common? <1> Good question, its actually most common in the Western world, especially with europe, USA and even some populations in the middle east  <0> oh thats good to know.  do people prefer long or short brown hair? <1> I guess that's just personal preference but i know the strands are thicker than fair hair but as much as red hair! <0> I guess thats true.  Do a lot of people have red hair in these parts of the world where brown is ? <1> I'm not sure but if i had to take a guess i would say that in europe, most definitely but in the middle east, i would doubt it very much. The cool thing about brown hair is it varies from lght brown to almost black hair(mine is almost black that you kinda cant tell if its black or not) <0> Thats good to know <1> Yeah you could say I'm really cool. Wanna go on a date?
<0> My daughter graduated high school! <1> congrats! you must be proud! <0> I am,  thanky ou! <1> My daughter is only in eigth grade we have a while to go <0> Not that long, kids seem to grow so quickly!
<0> I love exercising! It is funny how not too long ago, fitness was considered the mere capacity to carry out daily activities without becoming fatigued! Do you like to exercise? <1> I used to but i don't really anymore.  What kind of exercise do you do? <0> I love any exercise really. Anything that helps me enhance or maintain fitness and overall health and wellness. Do you like to exercise? <1> I don't really like to exercise anymore. i just don't have the time.  <0> Oh, well it's very important. I'm sure you know that it boosts the immune systems and helps prevent diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and obesity! <1> yes i know i should make time for it, and i could stand to lose a few pounds.  sometimes life gets too hectic though.  <0> By the way , do you like playing online games ?
<0> Today my friend had all of is awe,  becasue she won the singing contest at work. She is so shy and no one would have ever known she could sing.  <1> That's really cool! I bet people really underestimated that underdog! <0> I agree! I was amazed with her performance. She did really well. <1> That's awesome! Maybe she'll come out of her shell. <0> Yeah, maybe!
<0> oh nice ! my mom went to beauty school too <1> oh awesome ! well you guys are all set ! are you married ? <0> no were not married <1> Working as a stylist in my own salon, I meet plenty of interesting people from all walks of life, to say the least. <0> i bet you do i take my mom to the salon once a month <1> That is a good way to bond. What do you do for work if you don't mind my asking. <0> im in healthcare i work in a pharmacy <1> Healthcare is always a great field. My mom is a nurse and loves it so much she's not sure she will ever retire. <0> it definately has good job security especially nurses <1> I do not have my own salon.
<0> My kid was signing The Spice Girls a few years ago. She thought she had discovered a new band! She asked if I had ever heard of them before. <1> Yeah,  they are cute like that. How old is she ? <0> She almost 11 now. She loves to listen to all of the bands from when I was younger. It's really cute. <1> I have a 10 year old like that. <0> Yeah, children always do stuff like that.
<0> hey how are y o u ? <1> i'm good how are you doing <0> great just took a power walk <1> that is always nice are you in school <0> nope , are y o u ? <1> yeah i am graduating high school this year <0> cool , are you going to college after ? <1> yeah i want to go into physical therapy <0> Really?
<0> Going to the doctor for the first time since 2001 tomorrow. I'm dreading telling the doctor how long it has been since my last visit.  <1> It will be okay. It's always hard making that step,  but it's good for your health to do it.
<0> Pasta is so yummy, I love it. It's a staple food in traditional Italian cuisine. What's your favorite type of pasta? <1> Ohhhh! I love pasta! I think I could eat it everyday! I love fettuccine alfredo. What's your favorite? <0> Fettuccine Alfredo is great, it was actually named in Rome in the mid 20th century. I prefer regular pasta with sauce, myself. <1> That's always a solid choice too! Are there any other types of pasta that I should try? Sometimes the gluten in regular pasta upsets my stomach. <0> Oh, there's plenty to choose from, but finding any without gluten might prove to be tough as most pasta noodles are made from dough mixed with water and eggs. <1> I've heard that rice pasta can be a good choice. I'll have to check it out. I wonder where pasta first originated? <0> Oh, rice pasta, completely forgot about that one. Pasta was actually first referenced in 1154 in Sicily! <1> Oh wow I love Sicily , I went there on holiday last year and I had an amazing time .
<0> do you like to walk outside it can be relaxing <1> i do but i fall some broke my arm two different times <0> Ouch. how did you break it? <1> I was not paying attention and i tripped over a big piece of wood. <0> My husband works to work at a lumber yard and gets hurt alot.lol But thankfully he gets to retire next year so no more doctor visits for tripping,,lol <1> Thats great news, are you all planning to travel or anything? <0> Yeah,since I love to walk we are thinking of going somewhere to hike . <1> Thats sounds fun, and there is alot of great places to go. <0> we are thinking about the Grande Canyon this year. <1> I have never been there but I hear its beautiful. <0> I havent either but Ive allways wanted to go.So Im excited to see it in person <1> Who are you going with?
<0> Obesity is such a big issue, especially with the whole body positivity movement. It is a medical condition that involves having a large excess of body fat. <1> Oh yes, I can see it every day. Part of it is out of laziness, and part is due to the sedentary lifestyle most of us have, I think <0> Some people seem to think it is hard to lose weight but it really isn't. People are considered obese when their BMI is over a certain limit. <1> BMI is such a terrible tool. It doesn't take into account muscle or other factors. :( <0> It is pretty accurate a lot of the time but that is true. It is done by dividing a person's weight by the square of the person's height. <1> There are more accurate measures, but sometimes it's hard to figure them all out and what to trust. Anything else interesting? <0> Well the idea that obese people can eat little and still gain weight due to metabolism is generally not supported, thankfully. <1> That's mostly true, but there is a little bit of truth in that given how different the speeds are on people's metabolisms and how weight is distributed. Do you know any other ways to measure body fat?
<0> yeah , i my hubby makes my life easier too . life is different than before them . <1> i hear you . life is incomplete ever since my dog passed . <0> OH i am so sorry to hear that :( <1> Thank you for your concern. It has been hard, but I will do my best to move forward. <0> we dont have any pets...just husband and two teen aged boys. <1> Well, considering how much work a couple teen boys can be, you probably don't have any time to spare for pets. <0> yes...i had cats years ago before i had kids...always wanted another cat but life got so busy...maybe when they move out <1> Cats are great for companions once you have an empty nest, for sure. No worries, I'm sure someday you will be able to get another furry friend. :) <0> we all get along great....it probably wouldnt be a big deal but we have so many activities i feel they'd get neglected <1>  Luckily, cats tend to do their own thing, hence why they make great pets for busy people. <0> this is true!! you can even leave them for short periods...like overnight and they are pretty chill.  <1> Absolutely! Unlike dogs, who NEED you constantly. haha <0> true! and they dont do well with a liter box..lol <1> The day I see a dog use a litter box is the day I buy a camera for sure. heh heh <0> So how do you train the dog to use the toilet?
<0> hello ! how are you today ? <1> how are you ? i am larry and i love to cook ! <0> nice to meet you , larry . i don't cook but my wife and kids are great cooks ! <1> i'm great ! i'm chef and an avid fisherman . <0> do you work at a restaurant ? i work as a plumber , inside mostly . <1> what do you like to do in your spare time ? i'm either cooking or outside . <0> mostly hang out with my kids we have three ! we all love getting chocolate ice cream . <1> do you have any favorite movies ? i love spiderman ! ! ! <0> i prefer the comic book versions more ! do you read at all ? <1> I read a lot since I spend all my time indoors.
<0> i love baking cookies ! i make them out of spaghetti and chocolate chips . <1> bugs bother me but scorpions are the absolute worst <0> scorpions and spiders are my number one fear in regards to ways to die . <1> i like grey it is the color of my room , my car , and pretty much my life <0> i cannot say i like grey , the country bake sale generally has pastel colors . <1> bake sales have people . i work for the post office , it keeps me away from people <0> mail induced death is number 179 on my death list ; mailmen are forbidden in this house . <1> in to conspiracies ? nascar drivers , like my dad , say their owners are aliens <0> alien probe malfunction is number 296 on my list of potentially death causing incidents . <1> whatever . where does death by scorpions fall on your list ?
<0> I just realized today I have not been home to where my family is from in a little over 10 years. <1> Ohh wow! Are you excited?
<0> So can you explain the coding aspect <1> Yes, to some extent. Analysis, development, and generating algorithms are also essential. <0> My husband has a degree in computer programming.  I am not great at it though. <1> Interesting, where did he get his degree? <0> It is just an associates degree and he got it in Mississippi.

<0> My sister came over to my house the other day.  SHe was quick to show off her new iphone 8. <1> Wow,  is she an older or younger sibling?  <0> She is 10 years younger than I am,  and quite spoiled.  She always has the  nicest things. <1> Aww man that sucks,  One day your hard work will pay off,  so don't let it get to you too much. I am sure she is not intentially doing that
<0> It's the fear of wide open spaces. It can also be fear of crowds, which would cause social anxiety and even traveling short distances. <1> That sounds really difficult. Can it be treated with cognitive behavioral therapy? <0> Most likely but even Xanax and other anxiety drugs really help. <1> I have found that daily yoga and a strict vegetarian diet eliminate stress for me. <0> I'll have to look into that. Cooking, believe it or not, is also therapeutical for me as I'm also a gourmet cook. <1> See. I'm not a great cook. <0> I can teach you.
<0> Sounds like it! I've never tried dancing that much before. <1> You should! It has aesthetic and symbolic value which will make you appreciate life more. <0> I am a terrible dancer though. More of the "hairbrush as a mic" kind of dancing...  <1> i never have but would love to take some lessons ! <0> I wish I could. I have really bad knees. What else do you like to do? <1> I like to go to the gym and ride my bicycle. <0> Thats great! I have an elliptical in my bedroom. Its better than a treadmill. Less impact on the joints.  <1> You still sound in pretty good shape.
<0> I have been fortunate to live a good life but I found a lump in my neck.  Most people would get it checked out immediately.  I waited.  I was scared to get the news. <1> I would absolutely be scared too. Good news or bad,  I would be a worried wreck beforehand. Have you gotten it checked out yet?
<0> A co-worker at work needed some money for a drink,  but I didnt have any cash,  so I let them have my debit card to go buy them something <1> Did you know them well? You must be very trusting. <0> A co-worker at work needed some money for a drink,  but I didnt have any cash,  so I let them have my debit card to go buy them something <1> I think I would have just said I didn't have any cash and let that be the end of it. <0> It was tempting, but I was feeling nice that day.
<0> I'm really scared to go back to school. <1> Oh no!  What has you scared?
<0> I enjoy getting my hair colored. <1> Speaking of Hair, have you ever seen the musical? <0> I have never seen the musical! I did see some of it on tv with Ricki Lake I think? <1> Yep, It's a musical based in the 60's. <0> That's cool. Have you ever dyed your hair? <1> I have only one time. I really like the different hairstyles people have. <0> I agree! There are so many different ones to choose from <1> I hear the crazies hairstyles are in Thailand.
<0> hey ! how are you doing ? <1> great how are you ? i went to the park today . <0> i bet that was very relaxing . i wish i could leave the center <1> what center are you at ? i'm work at a center as a doc . <0> i am at a detention center for juveniles <1> oh , wow . that is interesting . i have a daughter that is smart . <0> i wish i was smart enough not to do stupid things like shoplift <1> oh ! that is one of the reasons i am looking for a new center to work at .
<0> My dog died in my neighbors electrical fence last night. I am devastated!! I don't know what to do. <1> Oh no,  poor dog :( I'd be devastated too,  i love dogs so much. <0> My heart is broken and I can't stop crying. I feel so helpless that I could not save her.  <1> Don't beat yourself up over it,  it was a very tragic accident but who could've known. He's in a better place now. <0> It's going to take me a while to stop thinking about him. He was my best friend.
<0> i will release my project soon,  and i'm so excited because i worked insanely hard on it <1> Yes I believe in you <0> thank you,  i'm believe in myself and all the hard work i put in this project <1> Your hard work will not fail you <0> I can't wait to see the final product.
<0> Good evening, have you ever been to a circus and encountered a comic performer such as a clown? <1> Yes indeed! Gotta say -- I'm not a big fan. There's something a bit creepy about them. How about you? <0> I completely agree.  The older that I get, the more afraid of them I become.  One group of clowns that I find frightening is the group Insane Clown Posse.  Have you heard of them?  <1> Aren't they more of a music group? But, yes -- point taken! I know their fans, the Juggalos, dress up in clown-like makeup. I think more of clowns like Steven King's "It"! <0> That's true, they are a music group.  Juggalos are freaky along with the movie IT.  I can't believe that people were dressing up like evil clowns back in 2016 and hiding near schools.  Wouldn't that be freaky to encounter one at night? <1> Totally agree. I'm not sure what would motivate people to do the evil clown dress up -- I guess the thrill of spooking people. Not funny! Did you see IT? <0> I did see IT.  I think I remember seeing it on TV right when it came out in 1986. That movie still freaks me out to this day.  I haven't seen the new version yet.  Have you? <1> NO! And I forgot about the original. Stephen King is a master at what he does. And I did notice that IT is now on HBO. So if you want to rewatch it.....ha! <0> I agree! Stephen King makes every movie great. He did a good job with IT.
<0> Good afternoon how are you today? <1> I'm good. A soldier could be conscripted or a volunteer. <0> Thats true do you think America will ever do a mandatory draft again? <1> Most armed forces consider "soldier" with a general meaning. <0> Yes most soldiers have different ranks.  How many ranks are there in the armed forces? <1> Typically, the uniforms denote the rank by an insignia attached to the uniforms. <0> Yes this is true. Do you know the highest honor given to soldiers? <1> Soldier ranks include trooper, marine, sniper, ranger, and medic. <0> You seem that you know well about the armed forces, were you interested to be a soldier ?
<0> Parenting and child rearing is the same  <1> Yes it is, it is the physical, emotional, social, and intellectual development of a child. Unfortunately there are too many bad parents out there <0> i agree many parents do not have enough dicipline for their children <1> I never know who should discipline more, the parents or the school system. Maybe it really should be 50-50.  <0> not sure i would want the school system responsible for diciplining my kids <1> At the age, kids brains are sponges. They soak up everything they see and hear. They spend the majority of their childhood in schools.  <0> The school system should  be responsible for disciplining my kids, that will be great.
<0> I feel bad for forgetting about my mom's birthday <1> You must feel horrible!  Get her something extra nice and I am sure she will forgive you!
<0> I was extremely relieved when I found out my dad beat cancer. <1> Thats wonderful news! Its such a nasty disease! How long has he been clear?  <0> About 2 years now. <1> Well I hope he has 100 more years to go! :) 
<0> I love going on wine tasting tours in the Niagara region <1> I've never gone wine tasting before but I know about it. <0> It is a great experience.  Not only do you get buzzed but you learn how to drink wine properly.  It sounds pompous but it really makes a difference. <1> It really does sound like a great time, as it is a sensory evaluation of the wine. <0> Depending on where the wine hits your tongue it tastes completely different.  This is why different types of wine are served in different glasses  <1> I know what you mean. Also, wine tasting has been around since ancient times. <0> Did the Romans or Greeks have wine tastings similar to common day wine tastings? <1> Not really, since wine tasting has been around since the 14th century. <0> Where and how did it originate?  I always assumed the Romans had a hand in it.  <1> It originated long time by traditional wine makers who passed it on to the modern one
<0> I was so happy to watch my friend do a backflip <1> I've always been too scared to do a backflip. I always worry I'm going to break my neck or something. Did it take him a long time to get it right?And did he get hurt? <0> I think he just took gymnastics classes. He luckily did not get hurt! <1> Oh,  that makes sense. And I'm glad to hear that. I always worry about that sort of thing. You ever think about trying to do it netx? <0> no  i never  tried  to so  it  netx . Are  you worry  about  your  neck  or  some  of  your  body parts  ?
<0> I was really embarrassed and disappointed  <1> oh why? <0> Because I forgot my wedding anniversary <1> Oh no! That's always an awkward situation. How did you recover? <0> I took my wife to a very expensive restaurant and got a nanny to take care of our boy. <1> That sounds like a lovely evening. Which restaurant did you go to? <0> An Italian restaurant. We love a good pasta! <1> I hate pasta.
<0> hi ! how are you doing tonight ? <1> i'm doing great . just relaxing with my two dogs . <0> great . in my spare time i do volunteer work . <1> that's neat . what kind of volunteer work do you do ? <0> i work in a homeless shelter in my town . <1> You are a very selfless person!
<0> I work at a library cataloging materials and am often asked to help my coworkers--it makes me feel like an expert,  though I'm not. <1> Sounds like your co workers respect you then <0> They seem to. Or,  at least,  they know whom is the right person to go to for those specific kinds of questions! <1> Or that as well ha <0> yes they usually ask specific questions
<0> I moved into this new house and was woken up with this horrible screeching noise in the middle of the night. <1> Terrifying! What was it? <0> It turned out to be the sump pump,  I guess it was old. But yes,  it scared the daylights out of me! <1> Oh good. I bet!  I wouldn't have been able to go back to sleep after that!  Do you have to replace the pump? <0> Yes. I just hope it won't be too expensive. I'll get it done soon because I need to make sure I don't wake up to that noise again!
<0> that sounds interesting , what are your hobbies <1> you aren't reading what i type <0> I am reading everything you type lol <1> Well how do you feel about history then? <0> I enjoy it very much. I find it fascinating that everything that we are able to read about happened and in certain forms begins to repeat itself <1> See, that's better! History is my favorite as well, my father didn't care much for it though <0> I think it is harder for some because they see it as a boring subject. But it is supposed to be understood with one's perception as well as their intellect. <1> Yes I totally agree. There are many facets to history 
<0> One of my love birds had a baby but she is a terrible mother. So I am now taking care of the baby and feeding her everyday. She is so cute! <1> Ah what a responsibly to take on! You are a great example,  is it quite tough? <0> No. The baby bird just sleeps and eats do it is really easy.  <1> Alot easier than a kitten or a puppy then?
<0> i never got the chance to get promoted at work even though all my colleagues did! <1> Oh man,  I would be so jealous. When will it be your turn?  <0> i am envying them. i don't know ,  i'm working very hard as well. <1> I think your boss should give you more recognition in that case!
<0> I don't know a lot about Italian food, other than I like it.  Are there a lot of regional variations? <1> Yes! There are actually huge variations! Especially between the north and south parts of the Italian peninsula. <0> What are the specific differences between Northern and Southern Italian food? <1> Well, there are differences due to Italy's regional diversity, especially between the North and South of the peninsula. <0> I am intrigued to know what kinds of differences there are. <1> Well, the Italian cuisine varies greatly by region, especially from the north and the south of the country's peninsula. <0> Why are the regions of Italy so different? <1> Well I don't know all of Italy's regions, but there seems to be some major differences in the food between the north (alps) and the south of the Italian peninsula. <0> It is so interesting. I wonder what the cause of the diversity is.
<0> I am so into the practice of changing my hair color! this time i have it purple, are you adventorous enogh to try purple hair> <1> I wish I was! Maybe some purple sections! I love changing my hair color too though. What other colors have you tried? <0> Well not to many because i do it with a professional hairdresser! so its very expensive, i had it red and orange before <1> Oh, yes. It can be very expensive to go to a professional. I tend to do my own! Red and orange are both fun! What else do you know about hair color? Is it damaging to your hair? <0> A little bit but no worries everyone is doing it, in denmark is very popular 75% of women and 18% of men hae reported using hair dye!
<0> Yesterday,  I ate a whole pizza by myself! <1> I take you don't have issued with you weight. <0> No,  I just did it because nobody thought I could. <1> Ok,  then.If it was a 1 thing only,  no problem.

<0> Hey! I'm really into rock and roll music.  <1> Me too! My favourite is The Beach Boys <0> Oh, what do you like about them the most?  <1> They're highly influential especially because of their vocal harmonies and surf songs <0> True. Brian Wilson is a legend. I have a pristine copy of the album Pet Sounds on vinyl. <1> That's amazing, I can't believe that's their 11th studio album!
<0> I really enjoy chili peppers in my meals because it proves the kick I like. <1> Oh dude, I love hot and spicy food. Sign me up! What was the last spicy stuff you ate? <0> I had thai cuisine with extra chilis on my chicken it was so delicious. <1> Hmm, I've never had much Thai food. It seems a bit too exotic, but actually, I don't have any idea what it's like. What is it like? <0> Its light dishes that have strong flavors and have a spicy edge to them. <1> Is it a lot of pasta and/or starches? I can't do Italian on account of all the pasta, and Mexican is off limits with all the tortillas and whatnot.
<0> i am waiting for my sister to arrive into town.  <1> Ooh, sounds nice, Always good to see the siblings. <0> Yes we are going to eat Sushi. Do you like Sushi? <1> I like the fake sushi that does not have any uncooked fish <0> lol. that is how i started eating it. 
<0> I watch my girlfriends dog every once in a while and she just isnt getting potty training.  She is a little over 5 months old and some weeks she does a great job and the next week she'll go to the bathroom everywhere but outside. <1> That's super frustrating! I've only ever had outside pets so I can't really offer advice,  but it's one of those things where your anger is all misplaced because you know you can't really be upset with the dog since it doesn't know any better.
<0> that sounds like a fun place to live ! <1> it is , but i'd rather stay in and read a good book <0> Do you not like the cold weather there? <1> I do, I just don't want to be out in it.  <0> I would love to spend the day indoors reading.

<0> I see.     They are not funded particularly well. <1> No - I understand there's currently some debate about the future of the civilian space program <0> Yes, I am desperate for both me and him that it get approved.  <1> It's such a shame - the organisation that won the space race might be in jeopardy <0> I know right! Now a days, satellites are more important that asteroids, which always blew me away in science class. Luckily I married the brains

<0> Oh,  I am so sad that my family could not come and visit me. I miss them all so much. Why is life so busy for everyone these days? <1> I sure wish it wasn't. I live far from my family and they can't even make time for me to go to them. So I feel for you,  it is very sad. <0> Family should come first,  right? The people of today are just becoming more isolated and lonely. I wish everyone would wake up! <1> Absolutely first. Especially when you don't live close. <0> Is that true?
<0> I'm looking for a new recipe and want to experiment with gouda cheese.  Do you have any ideas? <1> It's such a mild Dutch cheese, that it goes well with lots of things. You can even just melt it on toast! <0> So it's mild.  That's great to know. What else can you tell me about gouda? <1> It's very old, going all the way back to the Middle Ages. The first recorded mention of it is from 1184. <0> 1184?  That's amazing.  I had no idea about the history of gouda.  I've wanted to cook with it for a while now, but it's expensive. <1> Indeed, the price of Gouda has been disputed a long time. In the Middle Ages, buyers negotiated price with a system called "handjeklap," which involved clapping hands and shouting prices. <0> That is so interesting.  I wish I could negotiate the price at my local grocery store:) <1> That would make shopping more fun. We're a long way from the time when all the cheeses would be brought to the market square to sell. <0> You're right...we've come a long way since then, however, I do love to go to outdoor farmer's markets which gives me that old world feel. <1> I love that to.
<0> My lawn is getting overgrown and I don't know if I can afford a new mower.  <1> Try your local pawn shop for a cheap one you don't want a messy looking yard. <0> I'm afraid they might not be in very good condition <1> True, do you have a neighbour you could borrow one from? <0> I do. But they don't like my dog very much because she poops in their yard like the sneak she is <1> Haha yeah that'll upset anyone I guess. Could you arrange to borrow one from a family member? <0> I think I am going to check on Marketplace <1> What's marketplace? Is that on Facebook? <0> It is on Facebook. You can list or buyitems from there. I buy clothes and just about anything <1> That sounds good, I'm sure you'll find a mower on there! 
<0> i'm not in school are you <1> yes , full time studying radiology on top of my office job . very busy <0> wow, impressive.  did you decide to change careers? <1> No, the office job is just to get me through my radiology studies. What do you do? <0> I am a lawyer <1> Wow, mister big bucks here!
<0> phew . that was a tough day out in the cold . <1> it is cold here too , where are you from ? <0> canada . i am an apprentice electrician , so lots of time outside . <1> oh wow ! i am in colorado , i am outside a lot too . <0> colorado would be cool to visit . lots of trucks there , i love my trucks ! ! <1> i mostly hike when the weather is nice , but too cold now ! <0> yeah getting cold . gotta help my parents on their farm soon . <1> wow, that sounds like a lot of work

I will keep my fingers crossed that your wi-fi keeps working! <0> Weather does not affect my connectivity.

What were you doing? <0> Playing a game called Starcraft <1> starcrafft is cool, i usually play and my 2 cats and dog watch <0> I wish I had animals watching I just sit there and eat junk food <1> i love junk food too, especially orange candy <0> I'm more into chocolate, I love bitter more then sweet <1> dark chocolate is healthy and good for you <0> Yea, but I don't think they mean in the amounts that I eat it
<0> I am helping a friend that has lost his job recently. <1> That's very kind of you. How long has he lost his job? <0> he has been out of work for about 2 months now <1> That is tough. It is nice of you to help him out. <0> have you ever lost your job? <1> No I haven't. But I'm sure it is a trying time. <0> What do you like to do when you aren <1> I like to cook. I eat a vegan diet so it is easy to fix things at home versus eating out. You? <0> i meant to say arent at work. i love to cook as well!  <1> What kind of food do you cook? <0> i love to make asian foods and chicken dishes <1> Oh cool. Sounds healthy.

What was it like? <0> Well I didn't realize it was there until I looked down.  It didn't seem to acknowledge my presenad and kept looking for more fish to eat. <1> Wow, that must have been amazing. There are two varieties of the rays, one larger and another a bit smaller. Do you know how big yours was?
<0> i dont know much about sushi tell me more <1> Most sushi is made with raw seafood.  I like tuna. <0> Mmm, tuna! I'm a fan. <1> I saw this really good spicy tuna and shrimp recipie but i wish i could remember what site it was on.  <0> I've never tried making sushi at home, that sounds really fun!

<0> hello,  i have brown hair <1> Brown hair is awesome!  Interestingly, the strands of brown hair are thicker than those of fair colored hair. <0> i never knew that , i figured it all hair is the same except the color of it <1> Not so!  But brown hair is the second most common human hair color though. <0> let me guess, black is the most common  <1> Bingo!  Yes, it is!  And brown hair actually varies from light brown to almost black! <0> brown then has a variety of shades, not just one color <1> Yes your right it has different and attractive shades. 
<0> you should complain . i've an office job but they treat me fair <1> i should complain . my stupid coworker got promoted over me <0> What was the promotion for? <1> It was for a manager position.  I had practically been doing the job for years. <0> That stinks. Hopefully they recognize you next time.
<0> I was so shocked when my great grandpa visited the other day. He never leaves his house. <1> That sounds like such a surprise. Does he have a disability that keeps him at home? <0> Wow! What was the special occasion that got him out of the house? <1> Do you usually go to visit him instead? <0> Yes, I do try to visit him every week.  He has social anxiety which keeps him home.   <1> Good for you. Family's real important. I try to get out to visit mine whenever I can even if I'm busy <0> Very true!  I love shopping online, so I have been trying to teach him how to use Amazon Pantry for his groceries but he is resistant to change.  <1> At that age? No surprise. Maybe you could order for him?  <0> Nah, I really don't understand online shopping.
<0> I just gotta sleep it off, it's not severe for me. <1> Okay that's good. The amount of dairy a person who is lactose intolerant can tolerate varies from person to person. So you're pretty lucky! <0> Working in a doctors office helps with getting the correct information for my intolerance <1> Yeah. We should not consume more lactose as it has adverse effects on our body.  <0> Definitely!  What do you use an alternative to lactose? <1> Well, I always consume milk products in alternative to lactose. That works good for me. <0> Lactose is the sugar component of milk.  You should try banana milk; it's not that bad! <1> Of course I will love to try that. But it costs more I guess. What about the other alternative? <0> They have all sorts.  Banana, rice, soy, oat, coconut, cashew, almond,  lactose free, etc.   <1> Sounds great. I will try these too. How are you managing your diets with all these stuffs? <0> Carefully.  It's very time consuming, but not feeling sick makes it all worth it in the end.  I need my health to continue school.  <1> Yeah, its very vital for us to continue our life with fit and healthy. I will let you know once I tried this stuffs.
<0> The future looks bright though right now things are not going as i had planned <1> What are you going to do to change that? <0> Keep doing my best in whatever i do. I'm sure all shall be well. <1> Keep your head up high,  good positive thinking. <0> Thank you, I always try to look at the positive side of things.
<0> Man,  I really thought today could be a crazy day. <1> Was it another boring day today? 
<0> Have you ever been to Carolines on Broadway? It is a stand-up comedy located in Times Square <1> I have not, I also haven't heard of it.  Though I have heard of the laugh factory and the comedy store. <0> A lot of people have performed at Carolines like Louis C.K., Jerry Seinfield, Jay Leno and Chris Rock. The Laugh factory sounds entertataing <1> I've certainly heard of all those comedians.  Is the Caroline's a very famous comedy joint in New York?  Now that I think about it I've heard of the Cellar also. <0> It is one of the most famous, established stand up comedy clubs in the United States in Times Square in New york city <1> How long has it been in business and famous?  Ohhh my memory just flooded with thoughts.  I just remembered Patrice O'neal another comedian, now deceased, said he often performed there also. <0> Caroline Hirsch started it in 1981! <1> Does it have a certain culture, like the Apollo where the crowd viciously boos you off the stage if you have a bad act? <0> I am sure it is does since it is marketed as the Americas Premiere Comedy Nightclub, I bet no new people are allowed ha! <1> I didn't remember anything about comedy.
<0> I really wish they would bring back 8 tracks. <1> I'm not sure I've ever used them. I think my earliest music media was cassettes. <0> oh wow you must be younger than me. do you like movies <1> I FORGOT! my dad would listen to eight tracks when i was a kid.  i feel ancient.  love the movies! <0> whats your favorite genre of movies <1> sci- fi and comic book superhero movies. i like fantasy, too. <0> i like drama comedy and action <1> do you have a favorite, or one you plan on seeing? <0> i want to see Joker <1> ME TOO! joaquin phoenix is a mad good actor!  <0> way better joker than jared leto <1> lol! right.  but you know what, i have to give heath ledger and jack nicholson their props.
<0> hi there , my name is ali . <1> good evening ali . tanya here . <0> hey tanya . i went to school with a girl named tanya back when i was at yale . <1> cool . i have been so bored , so of course i eat ! <0> oh i understand that . i grew up with some of the best food back in manhattan . <1> yum . good thing i enjoy using the rowing machine and treadmill . <0> so did i ! my parents had all kinds of equipment thanks to their banking job . <1> that's great . any pets ? i have a german shepherd and a schnauzer . <0> unfortunately no . the dorms at business school doesn't allow them . <1> do you long hair or short ? i just tried a short haircut .
<0> Brown hair is a super popular hair color. <1> Yes it is, so is black. I'm brown myself <0> Me too! I used to dye my hair. Mostly to hide Grey's, because I wanted to be fashionable. <1> I pluck my gray hairs with tweezers! I want to dye my hair deep purple like I used to years ago. <0> Oh that's such a fun color! I've always wanted to go blue but I'm not sure I'm brave enough. Some of my favorite artists have blue hair. <1> I think you should try it, we only have one life to live so why have regrets over something so small?
<0> Hi, what is your opinion on obesity? I think it is certainly a problem and nobody respects people who try to live healthy I feel like <1> What do you think obesity is caused by? I feel like if people would be more active that would help <0> I think that is part of it, but also, it takes a lot of discipline to make your own food, and since all fast food is essentially bad for you, people can make wrong choices very easily <1> It is sometimes about poor choice, but there is also a genetic component that is linked to obesity. <0> That is true, I think if your choices are poor you will be in worse health regardless, but there are certainly uncontrollable factors as well <1> I do believe it is a larger problem in the US vs other countries. This has to be chalked up to a combination of factors. <0> That is true, we cannot be so genetically bad that our rates are so much higher <1> Yes 
<0> My hair has always been long and I had been scared to have a short hair cut. Last December,  I finally took the plunge and cut off all of my hair. <1> Good for you! There is nothing wrong or uncool about short hair. <0> That's what I have discovered! I get a lot of compliments on it and I feel really good about myself when I go out! <1> Great! I'm glad that it worked out well for you! <0> I can't believe how different I feel! I still feel hot though :)

I'm trying to buy that one too. <1> His debut album was called Doggy style, and it was totally awesome! <0> Didn't he release a song about his murder trial? <1> He sure did!  It was called "Murder Was the Case" and it was amazing!

DO you know any good recipe for pasta <0> If you are allergic or prefer gluten free, then you can make pasta with rice flour. <1> I will love to make those. My cousin has told me a lot about pasta <0> Pasta originated from Sicily in 1154? <1> Wow. You must really be a fan of pasta to have known where it originated from <0> Yeah, I would love to visit Italy one day and try all kinds of pasta. Sicily is also the largest island of the Mediterranean sea <1> oh great .do like to go to italy?

<0> My boyfriend just turned around the other day and proposed to me while we were taking a walk! <1> You must be the luckiest girl on earth <0> I feel like I am walking on sunshine from that moment.  <1> I believe it! I hope he made it perfect for you. <0> He did. He was nervous but gave this romantic speech about how I was the one and then got on one knee and I started crying. <1> That is very sweet. Will you have alcohol at your wedding? I've never had any. <0> I dont know yet. I havent started planning but I am putting together an pintrest page on what I want.  <1> Good idea. I love Pintrest. If I were getting married I'd love to bring my dog, she is my best friend! <0> Aww, that's cute! I doubt my cat would behave if I brought to our wedding, though.
<0> I have been trying to lose my pregnancy weight recently and just started a new exercise program this week. <1> Do you do any strength training to help lose weight? <0> Only tiny 5 pound weights for my arms while I am cycling <1> That sounds like a good starting place. Just keep gradually increasing the weight. <0> I think it will be a while before that. I'm trying to increase the reps first. <1> Muscle growth should be faster if you increase the weight until muscle failure instead of reps.
<0> well cora is like my son i had him since i was married <1> oh i see . so he was your husbands kid ? <0> yes that is right <1> That's awesome.

<0> good afternoon  i have purple hair, yes purple <1> Love it!  I assume you dye your hair with hair color as opposed to brush in color that washes out?   <0> i use dye, it lasts longer <1> Yeah, it would be a pain to put color in every day.  Sounds fun!  I love seeing colors like that in people's hair and I even love the gray styles that are so fashionable these days.  Me, I need to dye my gray hairs I'm getting and I'm too young to be getting them! <0> :) i do like the gray style look but I like to have some color <1> I hear ya.  I love the mermaid gray and green and purple combo too. or pink! Hair coloring can be done by a professional or at home...which do you prefer?

<0> I try to stay physically fit through proper nutrition and light to moderately vigorous exercise, do you do similar things? <1> I need to! It' been a while but I was way into fitness. Now my fitness is fitness this donut in my mouth. What all do you do? Way interested.  <0> Well you can start by just walking 30 minutes a few times a week, and then build into some kind of physical exercise like swimming or weight training. I like weight training because I like seeing my muscles grow and I find it enjoyable. <1> I used to LOVE going to the gym. My life had some changes recently, it's hard getting back in the swing of things. I do, however walk 30 minutes a day. Do you stick with a certain diet? <0> I wouldn't call it any particular diet like keto or low-fat really. I just stick to whole unprocessed foods and try to eat a good amount of legumes, nuts, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and a bit of meat,eggs,dairy to fill the rest. I consider that to be "proper" nutrition. <1> I think it sounds great. I did low-calorie for years. I looked fly but was tired a lot. Yours sounds much better. <0> It's important to find a balance in a healthy diet, I think a good way is to find nutrient-dense low calorie foods so you can eat bigger quantities and feel full while getting proper nutrients and not too many calories. <1> I loved egg white omelets filled with veggies. I'm getting hungry now! Getting groceries today, this inspires me to get the right kind. Thank you
<0> i also like watching mystery movies <1> those are great . i watch them at times . <0> I like to drink green tea while watching the films! <1> Same, whats your favorite type? <0> Macha green tea! its sweet yet smooth! try it sometime! <1> O I had that alot over the summer while on vacation in Italy! <0> Thats awesome, I want to go on vacation to the countryside! I love to run to clear my head and it'd be great to do that in peace. <1> Awesome! I'm also an avid runner and I have olive skin so I never get burns haha! <0> Wow, I am so jealous, I get sunburns all the time. All of my friends and family say I have olive color'd eyes! <1> I've never heard of olive colored eyes haha! Speaking of green tea I have green eyes <0> Really? it's common in my family when we're younger. <1> Ah, interesting. My whole family has dark green eyes.  <0> Really? I have brown eyes. 
<0> Hey man, I love listening to Snoop Dog. You know the American rapper and songwriter? <1> Oh yeah. He's great. I like almost all his songs <0> Yeah, I mean he sold over 23 million albums in the US alone. Do you have any of them? <1> I have Bush, it is really really good. His real name is Calvin Cordozar Broadus Jr. and is from Long Beach <0> Bush? Is that an album? I have "The Doggfather". I went double platinum in 1997. That one had some awesome tracks!

<0> My entire family and I pretty much all have brown hair. I don't know how strong of a gene it is but I'm happy I have it! <1> Yes there is lot of brown hair in my family too, and after all it is the second most common hair color after black hair.. <0> I had no idea that was a fact. I can definitely believe it though. Not a personal fan of black hair.  <1> People with brown hair are often referred as brunette.  That comes from the French term of brun, meaning brown. <0> There is another thing I learned. That's real interesting. Are there any similar synonyms for other colors?  <1> Not that I know of.  But another interesting fact about brown hair is that its strand are thicker than those of fair hair, but not as much as red hair. <0> Wow, it is funny how hair color also is prone to different textures as well.
<0> I was very envious on my best friend <1> It's OK we all get jealous sometimes. What did you envy about your best friend? <0> He has a better and nice car than mine <1> is it as dark color as yours? <0> No a white Mercedes Benz <1> it sounds pretty boring, you should try to get something that stands out like a A/C cobra <0> it's not boring <1> well you add some flame decals <0> I don't have that <1> well they sell them pretty cheap <0> I will look into that. I would do some research about it <1> cool. you can always get some new rims.
<0> I love pasta! It's a staple of Italian cuisine <1> Pasta is the best! I think spaghetti is my favorite dish! <0> Spaghetti is great, you can make it with rice flour for people who avoid gluten <1> Do you know how to make your own pasta? <0> Yes! I use flour, egg, and water to form a dough, then flatten it to make strips of pasta <1> Interesting! I might have to try that sometime. I usually buy store noodles. <0> Yes, it's easiest to buy it already made. I usually buy dry pasta, which is called pasta secca in Italian <1> I have heard pasta called "Aldenta" I think but I dont know what it means.
<0> My internet connection keeps breaking! How am I going to get all my work done? <1> I understand!  I live in the country and have the same problem.
<0> I was angry on my son. <1> Aww!  Why? <0> He beat up his sister! I never know how to handle these situations. I don't want to use violence against violence <1> Have you considered sending him to timeout? That would be a way to punish him without being violent with him
<0> i love to play guitar , i was only three when i started <1> my parents were killed by a clown when i was three . i was then adopted <0> hi , how are you ? do you like country music ? i'm a singer . <1> it is alright . i'm more of a pop fan myself <0> sad , i am sorry , did they every caught the clown ? <1> no . now i get scared whenever i see one <0> lets be happy and not think about that , i love national parks <1> i recently got a job ! now i work at a gas station <0> do you like rascal flats ? they are my favorite band . <1> not really . but my adopted dad likes them <0> now that's something happy to talk about ! i work in the industry <1> what industry do you work in ? <0> okay , so tell me more about yourself
<0> I have a big test coming up, I wish time would hurry up so I can get it over with. <1> Ahhh i bet your nerves are thru the roof. Whens the test date?  <0> Next week! <1> Good luck in your studying! what is the test on? <0> It is a composite of the many skills required for putting on a show. <1> I guess you will have many different things to study in order to be prepared for it.
<0> I can't wait to have grandkids. IS that weird? <1> Not to me!  Some part of me is anxious to be holding a grandchild, and then when they poop or get fussy, to hand them riiiiiiight back to their parents! <0> Haha yes its just something about having the kids come up to new york for the weekend and being about to see them! but not for too long lol <1> I have a cruise planned next month, but I would love cooking for grandkids.  <0> where is the cruise to? <1> Bahama's. I've always wanted to see islands. The beauty of them amazes me,  <0> I would love to see the bahamas! sadly I've never been out of the county <1> Me either! I figured the next time I head to a tropic resort location on some island I'll give it a go and I did!  <0> I have been to hawaii which feels out of the US but it's not!
<0> I walked into the room while she was cooking and was very quiet. I felt bad about what I did.  <1> What did you do? <0> Well I went out with old college buds and got trashed and slept with another woman. 
<0> how is your day ? mine is super duper . <1> i'm tired ! expecting in three months . triplets ! <0> that's quite the addition all at once . i'm single . my girlfriend ran off . <1> it is indeed . already looking after one step child . sorry about your ex . <0> yeah she's with our lawyer now <1> sounds serious . i'm busy settling in . just moved to this country . <0> he did more than my taxes . ha ha . i have kids though they're good . <1> i love kids ! i teach at a school near my house . <0> welcome to our country . where are you from originally ? <1> china . it is a very different society . <0> i love my house . indoors is the way to be . my friend teaches chinese children esl <1> cool . what is the name of your friend ? <0> here those beats i'm dropping . studio is rocking today . <1> i do not understand what you are talking about . <0> I mean I am releasing some new sounds in the studio.
<0> I found some mold growing out in the garage <1> Oh no,  that's bad.   Have you had someone come out and check the hose? <0> I ended up cleaning it myself,  I think I got most of it out <1> May be worth letting your insruance comapny know. Usually they have clauses that you have to tell them as soon as you see it otherwise they won't cover any of it. <0> I have not contacted the insurance company yet. 
<0> I love coloring my hair! It's fun to play with all the different shades of dye. Have you ever colored your hair? <1> Yes, I have made it purple and red before. <0> Those are fun colors! Did you have it done professionally or did you dye it at home? <1> The red I did at home. The purple I had to have done professionally to get it to stick. <0> That makes sense! Home coloring is a huge business! In 2011, sales reached $1.9 billion and they're thought to have reached $2.2 billion in 2016. <1> I can see that from all of the commercials that are on TV. Do you notice that they always show basic colors like black or brown? <0> That's a good point! They do always show black or brown! Believe it or not, 75% of all women claim to have dyed their hair at least once. Surely they used some other colors! <1> I would think so! Although, I guess covering gray and making it look natural is responsible for most of those billions. <0> For sure! I think most women continue to color their hair to cover gray or white hair.  <1> Yes i guess so
<0> I went to work the other day,  and I was the only person in the office. <1> Where you supposed to be there? If so,  then that is a nice feeling. <0> Yeah,  everyone else was just gone.  It was nice for a while,  but got a bit lonely.
<0> yesterday i was all alone! <1> I'm sorry to hear that. What happened? <0> I was working on my passion, programming some software. Worked on it all day! Did not realize I was alone all day until midnight hit! <1> Sometimes a little alone time is relaxing <0> Exactly, what do you like doing in your spare time?  <1> Watching TV, reading, mostly sleeping ha <0> That sounds a lot like me!  What is your favorite TV program.  
<0> hello ! how are you today ? <1> oh i feel as if i could live forever ! i'm quite strong for an old broad ! <0> live forever ? what is making you feel that way ? <1> i could just dance and sip wine by the light of the moon ! <0> very cool . i can eat ice creams by the gallon <1> that will not put too many years on your life ! not as many as me ! <0> i am a plumber for a living . let me eat my ice cream in peace <1> come on . guess how old i am ! before tvs ! <0> were you born in 1943 ? <1> not even close ! i am 100 baby ! hash tag forever young <0> wow ! i never thought you could be that old <1> life is good baby doll !
<0> I love pasta, the staple Italian cuisine. Do you enjoy it? <1> Hmm, to say that I love pasta would be something of an understatement, let's say. What's your favorite noodle style? <0> I have to say I love gnocchi. I make it myself by hand just as it was traditionally done. Sometimes people use machines, or buy commercially produced stuff. But I keep it traditional.   <1> Ooh I like that! Stick some nice spicy arrabbiata sauce with it, ahhhh! Have you ever had bucatini before? <0> Oh yeah! I love that spicy garlic and tomato sauce. No I have not had bucatini. Is that a type of cheese?  <1> Now you're speakin' my language. No no, it's a style of noodle, like a really long straw. Bucatini amatraciana is insanely good. <0> I'll have to try it out some time soon. There are 310 different forms of pasta to taste. I've tried maybe 5 or 6.. I'm way behind schedule!  <1> You can get them at Trader Joe's or like a halfway decent whole foods place, usually. Not that expensive. Also try cavatappi. It's like bucatini but little corkscrews, lol.
<0> Seven's my favorite number, because everyone says it's a lucky number.. but why do they say that! What's the history behind 7 <1>  Well is the natural number following 6 and preceding 8. <0> Of course... but is there more about it? Why has it been seen as somewhat of a special number throughout history? Anything interesting about it? <1> Well I have heard In the beginning, various Hindus wrote 7 more or less in one stroke as a curve that looks like an uppercase J <0> Alright, interesting. Some history there. What else is a fun fact about it? <1> Well in school I learned Both modern Arab forms influenced the European form, a two-stroke character consisting of a horizontal upper line joined at its right to a line going down to the bottom left corner,
<0> He actually came back with a gold medal,  I was actually doubting him for a while. <1> Who came back with a gold medal? 
<0> Hey, I love the Jazz music that originated from African-American communities of New Orleans. Do you like it? <1> I do and i am also from new orleans so that is cool! What are popular instruments in jazz music? <0> It can be played in guitar, and drums. It's characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals. Its very fun.  <1> I see. Are there different types or categories of jazz? <0> Jazz spread all over the world, which created many different national and regional variations in the style. There's really too many to count! <1> Ohh okay. What are some countries that jazz is popular in? <0> It has been linked to Africa, America, Europe independently, which a different style coming from each area.  <1> Nice. Did jazz influence another category of music? <0> Certainly, like Jazz fusion which incorporates Jazz, Funk, rock and blues. It was developed in the 1960s. <1> What does Jazz fusion sound like? I don't think I heard any artists play jazz fusion before.
<0> I do agree! What is your favorite orange-flavored soft drink? <1> I like Sunkist Orange the best I think. I never knew they are called "soft" drinks because it's a contrast with "hard" alcoholic drinks.  <0> Wow, what an interesting fact. I never considered that but it makes sense. <1> I love those weird types of facts. I usually drink soft drinks with caffeine, I have a Coke with me all the time. <0> Oh yes I love Dr. Pepper. Coke is a close second but I'll never drink Pepsi. <1> isn't it weird how people love either Coke or Pepsi? Not many people will admit to liking both. <0> I find the world to be a very divisive place these days. That analogy could be made about politics as well. We could all use more unity. <1> I agree, maybe Coke and Pepsi could be the start and call a truce in the cola wars, lol! <0> It would have an impact! lol Sony and Microsoft finally stopped bickering and started working together. <1> exactly that would be amazing, people need to be reminded that we are more alike than not <0> Exactly like as simply just saying what we have in common like i love pepsi! you?
<0> Snoop Dogg, or Calvin Cordozar Broadus, is my favorite rapper of all time. He is also a producer, songwriter, and actor! <1> I really liked his album "Reincarnated", and his talk show <0> What was the name of his talk show? My favorite album of his is Doggystyle, which was produced by Dr. Dre, another one of my favorite rappers. <1> The "Joker's Wild", a show in which comedians win money, and he is a great host <0> Oh I've heard of it. It was produced by Jack Barry, right? <1> Yes, and I like "Dead or Alive" with Tupac and Snoop Dog <0> I liked seeing him in one of the scary movies too. He was funny.
<0> I have brown hair - the most common color other than black <1> I think my is black but it might just be really dark brown <0> Eumelain is what causes dark hair - the more of it there is the darker the hair <1> Oh really? I guess I must have a lot of it then. <0> Hair coloring is very popular now.  75% of women in Copenhagen have used hair dye <1> Dang thats quite excessive, not really necessary. <0> Even 18% of men have colored their hair! <1> Haha im assumming it might be the gray haired people <0> Yes gray hair is associated with age and many people dont want to be thought of as old <1> My brother has gray hair and he is pretty young!
<0> I love to listen to jazz music.  It's very soothing. <1> Oh yes, especially since they have such a rich history in the African-American communities! <0> I agree!  The talent of so many of the musicians is amazing! <1> Absolutely, all the great jazz musicians know how to play the swing and blue notes that characterizes jazz <0> Miles Davis was one of the greatest jazz musicians.  Have you heard of him? <1> Oh yes, Miles Dewey Davis III was one of the greatest American jazz trumpeter, bandleader, and composer. <0> Did you know he went to The Juilliard School in New York City?  That's a very influential school for musicians. <1>  Miles Dewey Davis III was worst American jazz trumpeter, bandleader, and composer.
<0> Do you work out? I'm working pretty fierce on having a tone body. I'm into health, my well-being to perform in sports etc. <1> I do work out, but I need to more often. That's great you are so dedicated to it! <0> I'm still working on getting better proper nutrition (Cheetos get me) but moderate vigorous exercise feels great <1> Yes, we have a swimming pool so I've been able to get a bit more exercise, while enjoying the cool water during this hot summer. <0> I get fatigued if I don't. Do you feel better the days you do? Defined as capacity to carry out the day's without it <1> Yes, I do feel better when I exercise, unless I have had an already strenuous and tiresome day, then I feel exhausted when I do vigorous exercise.
<0> I have children and like to know they are being cared for well at child care facilities. Some of these places, day cares, nannies, babysitters and teachers can get too intrusive however. <1> I have kids too but I dont know If I could trust them with a stranger <0> I agree. It's important that a child receives quality child care from an early age, as it impacts their future, and they are our future. <1> Yeah they need to be shaped as young as possible. <0> Yes, and I wished more parents, siblings and family played more of a role in child care, instead of passing off to strangers and the government. <1> Yeah I think it is important for the direct family to be involved. <0> i dont have kids, i dont like kids
<0> Hello, Whats you're favorite type of pasta? <1> I love most pastas, but spaghetti is my favorite. Pasta is a staple in Italian food, so I ate it a lot growing up. <0> I like the more hearty cuts like  linguini or rigatoni or bucatini  <1> I like linguini too. Pasta is fairly easy to make, usually just using flour and eggs or water. <0> I've never really made it fresh but, i should probably give that a try.   I really like to cook.  I can make a pretty mean carbonara <1> I am an okay cook, but I usually just go with dry pasta, which is also known as pasta secca. <0> What do you normally sauce your pasta with?  Tomato? oil/garlic? <1> I will usually pair it with tomato sauce. Lately I've started making my own sauce. Each pasta dish is defined by the type of noodle, sauce, and cooking style. <0> I used to use the canned stuff too until I realised how easy it is to just make it out right.       I really like carbonara because its fast. <1> What about gnocchis, do you like it
<0> My friend got a promotion and moved to California last week. I always thought I would be the first one to get out of this dump. <1> I'm sorry your friend moved away. Sounds like me when I moved from Indiana to Florida. My friend was upset when I left too.
<0> good day how are you <1> how are you doing today <0> i am good listening to music , playing some video games . how about you ? <1> i am doing very well <0> that is good . are you married ?
<0> finally someone with some sense around here ! sorry if i'm talking too fast for you . <1> you are talking too slow for me , do you have any pets ? i have a dog <0> Wow! Too slow huh? I am typing almost 140 wpm <1> Well it is slow to my 170 wmp, it makes me feel like I am talking to a snail. <0> Sorry about that <1> Aplogy accepted, I went shopping the other day which I greatly enjoy. <0> Really? Where did you shop at? <1> I went to the pet store to by treats for my dog who is amazing as well. <0> Oh very cute <1> Do you have pets? <0> Yes I have a cat <1> I also enjoy cats, they are very independent.
<0> Imagine, i started working out two months ago, only to weigh myself and i have gained some weight <1> I hope it was maybe the weight of the muscle that the scale was picking up.
<0> 3 <1> What about 3? <0> i have read 3 of the game of thrones books.  do you like to read? <1> I do read occasionally, do you? <0> yes i like to read books that they then make movies to see how well they create the stories <1> the movies are okay , but the books are so much better . <0> i agree.  much more detail and better written <1> They always seem to cut the most important scenes from the book too! <0> yes they do and i think it is because of the ratings and censorship for the movies
<0> hello , how are you tonight ? <1> hi , doing well and yourself ? <0> i am doing okay . trying to figure out how to take a bath . <1> have you tried filling the tub ? <0> i've a water allergy , small amounts are all i can do . <1> i've terrible allergies . makes tending in the field trouble <0> i can understand that . no one visits me . <1> i prefer horses over people ! i love to ride , do you ? <0> i don't . i don't like animals at all . <1> i grew up on my fathers farm , always around them <0> i am a city girl . i have never been around them . <1> what sort of music do you enjoy <0> i prefer rap . i love tupac . <1> don't really listen to rap . i prefer rock especially if working
<0> my car had a small accident recently <1> I am sorry to hear that.Did you get hurt. <0> no it was a minor accident ,  but car got damaged little <1> Do you have full cover? <0> yes, I have full insurance to cover the repairs. thanks for your concern.
<0> Not that I know of. How does one treat anxiety? <1> Treatment depends on the kind of anxiety you have.  There is such a variety from generalized anxiety disorder, specific phobia, social anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, and also panic disorder. <0> When I get anxious I usually go work in my garden. <1> That is a good way to relax and give your mind a break. How big is your garden ? <0> it's about 10x12 feet, just a backyard thing.  <1> What kind of plants do you have ? Any vegetables ? Does it receive direct sunlight ? <0> it's all vegetables, season is almost over though. Last thing I had was pumpkins.  <1> Pumpkins are very nice but they take a lot of space. For my anxiety I like to visit museums, art in general relax me. <0> oh do you like art?
<0> My brother in the army showed up at my football event yesterday. I wasn't expecting him to come. I thought he was still stationed in Iraq. <1> That's amazing. You must have been so surprised and happy!
<0> swimming is fun . do you go to the beach as well ? <1> sometimes i do . while i'm asleep <0> While you're asleep?  How do you go swimming asleep? <1> I normally have a recurring dream of swimming out too far from the shore and drown. <0> Oh!  That makes more sense.  It's odd, I've never had a swimming dream.  Maybe you're stressed <1> It might be because I'm at the beach a lot.
<0> Snoop dog is my idol, he is my favorite artist in the world. <1> You are right, he is multitalented, he is not only a rapper, he is also an actor and a record producer. <0> yeah and he really supports weed which in my opinion is pretty nice, do you know when he was born? <1> I don't know where he was born, I know that by being born in 1971 he is over 45 years old.  <0> yea, i thought so i think it's crazy that he has been famous for so long.  <1> His debut album was released 25 years ago, in 1993. 
<0> I do not have much energy. I am having a  long-term fatigue and other symptoms that limits my ability to carry out ordinary daily activities. <1> Oh god buddy, i  think you are depressed <0> Yes it is a medical condition called Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) <1> Its CFS, Can you explain more about this. <0> The fatigue you experience is not  due to strenuous ongoing exertion and it is  not much relieved by rest neither was it due to a previous medical condition. <1> Ok, Due to what we are getting depression more. <0> Well all i know is that it is comparatively rare and we do not have a cure   with treatment being symptomatic. <1> We need more rest to and relive from the depression <0> That could be an option especially when No medications or procedures have been approved by the FDA <1> i hope they can focus more on research for medical treatments.
<0> I think I might have chronic fatigue syndrome because I'm so tired all the time <1> Do you have long-term fatigue and other symptoms that limit a person's ability to carry out ordinary daily activites ? <0> I have been fatigue for awhile now. What kind of symptoms do you mean? <1> Well fatigue is not due to strenuous ongoing exertion, it is not much relived by rest, and it is not due to a previous medical condition.  It is unexplained fatigue and severity of functional impairment <0> Yes, it is unexplained. No matter how much I rest I'm still tired. Is pain a symptom as well? <1> There is evidence that suggests that cognitive behavioral therapy and gradual increase in acitivty suited to individual capacity can be beneficial in some cases <0> I'll have to talk to my doctor about that. Does cognitive behavioral therapy mean I need a psychiatrist? <1> yea you may want to talk to your doctor as evidence supports the use of the medication rintatolimod
<0> how are you doing today <1> i am alright , living the great retired life . what about you ? <0> i work in an office <1> that must be interesting . do you need a smartphone for that ? i do not have one . <0> you do not . they provide everything <1> that does not sound too bad . do you know how to sew ? <0> i want to learn but i'm not sure <1> you should learn ! i can make all of my own clothes . <0> that would save a lot of money <1> it sure does , and i needed it for my cancer treatments . <0> i am sorry about that <1> no worries , it is gone now , and i had the support of my kids and grandkids . <0> Do you have a good health?
<0> I never thought I would see something this gross ever! <1> Oh geez! What on earth was it!
<0> Two years ago my wife and I got divorced. It has been very odd in this big house all by myself. <1> How do you feel these days?
<0> She dressed all in white, refused to leave her bedroom, and only sold 18 poems while she was alive, out of 1800 that she wrote.  This is the textbook definition of a hermit or recluse. <1> What made her so crazy though? Was it where she was raised, in Amherst, Massachusetts? <0> I'm not entirely sure. <1> I'm not the least bit surprised, since she was considered a bit of an eccentric by her neighbors. <0> Anyone who is a hermit or recluse would be considered eccentric. A lot of creative people are as well <1> That's true. Anyone who marches to the beat of their own drum is often shunned. <0> When they should be welcomed and celebrated. Just because someone else's version of happy doesn't match our own doesn't make theirs wrong <1> That's totally right! In hindsight I'm sure people would have gotten to know her <0> I'm not so sure. Some things have progressed while others have not in my opinion <1> That is fair, I should have specified. Some people would have retrospectively been able to appreciate her work, had they known. She still wouldn't have appealed to everyone. <0> Somehow what you said is right. 
<0> howdy ! how are you doing ? <1> i'm good how about you <0> i'm doing well . glad the crops are in for the fall . <1> oh great me , my job really makes me feel bad <0> sorry to hear that . i help my father not my own job . what do you do ? <1> 40 in a working labor is tough <0> That's tough, don't worry you will find something you love so much soon.
<0> I have become interested in watersports.  Do you like it? <1> I do like some of them, but I know there are many. What kind do you like? <0> I was thinking about wakeboarding or kayaking.  Which would you recommend? <1> I don't know much about the water sport of wakeboarding, but I do like to canoe. I think that's similar to kayaking.  <0> Is it expesive to buy a canoe?  Is it hard to do? <1> I didn't think it was hard to canoe, it's a pretty easy and relaxing water sport. It actually is an Olympic sport too, first started in 1924  <0> Wow!  I didn't know it was an Olympic sport.  Is it still? <1> I believe it still is. A fun competitive water sport is boat racing. I think that would be really fun to do! <0> Cool. It sounds like you really like water sports.
<0> My old roommate never did any dishes.  He also didnt wash any food off the plates so we had a sink full of dirty dishes and rotting food at all time.  It was miserable living there. <1> So,  I take you left to live someplace else? <0> Haha yes,  I ended up saving up then moving out and buying my own place.  I wont miss the flies sitting around the kitchen and he's still just as messy...now its on his own though instead of with other people. <1> Just remember to never invite you ex-roomate to your new place,  EVER!!!!!! <0> Yes for sure. I don't want to relive the experiences of living in a dump.
<0> My mom called me the day after my 28 birthday. Not to wish me happy birthday,  but to delivery awful news.  <1> Oh my goodness,  what was the terrible news? <0> She called and told me our brother had been in a terrible accident and that we needed to come to the ER immediately. 
<0> phew . that was a tough day out in the cold . <1> it is cold here too , where are you from ? <0> canada . i am an apprentice electrician , so lots of time outside . <1> oh wow ! i am in colorado , i am outside a lot too . <0> colorado would be cool to visit . lots of trucks there , i love my trucks ! ! <1> i mostly hike when the weather is nice , but too cold now ! <0> yeah getting cold . gotta help my parents on their farm soon . <1> i love farms , i am behind a desk , since i am an engineer . <0> that must be more interesting then fiddling with wires outside all day in the cold . <1> maybe i try to get the stress out by rock climbing after work <0> seems like you love the outdoors , wish i could say the same . <1> i do . what do you like to do ? <0> mainly just driving around in my truck to work sites , listening to country music !
<0> how are you ? i'm tired of my parents bothering me , hoping to move out soon . <1> i completely get it . my mom is way too traditional for me ! <0> i never drink or use drugs . i am 19 and just want to see my friends . <1> i understand . when do you think you might be able to move ? <0> not sure . i have a part time job at burger king . do you work ? <1> i do . i coach swimming at the pool near my house . <0> awesome . my parents are just always on me about something . are you moving soon ? <1> i'm still in school . i cannot move until i finish my degree <0> that must be tough . what do you study ? <1> i want to be a computer programmer . are you in school ?
<0> I've been stuck for several weeks on a part in this video game I've been playing... <1> is it really hard? or you just have not have that much time to paly <0> It's pretty tough. But it doesn't matter now... I let a friend of mine have a try,  and he got through it right away! It was pretty impressive to see. <1> yeah some people are just naturaly good at video games <0> That's definitely true. Some games I am good and some I am not.
<0> hello ! what are you doing up so late ? <1> i am just listening to classical music <0> i'm hanging out with my dog . <1> what is your dog breed <0> i've a black lab , do you have pets ? <1> no i don't have any pets <0> they really are great company , especially at night . <1> i am sure they are <0> what do you like to do for fun ? <1> i like to bike and read <0> so you are kind of outdoorsy , like me . i like to hike . i also like to read . <1> I like playing video games
<0> I took credit for some work that wasn't mine. My coworker has not found out yet. <1> oh no... will you tell them?  <0> I should, I feel pretty bad about it. <1> Oh,I feel so sorry for you do you think you will get in trouble over this?  <0> I really hope I don't. I've never been in trouble at this job before <1> What type of work do you do? <0> I sell exotic pets <1> Do you make a lot of money doing this ? <0> i get by on it pretty well. It's a good way to provide for my 4 kids
<0> Sometimes I'm surprised my son is actually my son. He currently has enough merit aid to pay for 2/3 of his college tuition! <1> Well that is quite the accomplishment.  <0> It is certainly much better than I was ever able to do.  I think my scholarship was $500 and I had no merit aide.  He set his academic bar high... I just told him to do his best. <1> He sounds like he has a great head on his shoulder. You must have taught him well. <0> Yup! He's a good boy and I am so proud of him
<0> I really like the number 7. Can you tell me anything about it? <1> its a natural number preceding 8 and following 6 <0> I think it is a lucky number. Wonder why 7 is associated with luck. <1> Not sure? The hindus in the beginning wrote 7 in one stroke as a curve <0> I see. I have seen 7 written with a line through it as well. How interesting. <1> Arabs write it with horizontal upper line 
<0> Fiction is a classification of story that is derived from imagination and made up <1> Ohh yeah, I love fictional books, especially novels. <0> fiction is used in so many formats too like writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games <1> That's what makes it so magical, it can be applied to almost anything. <0> Fiction is sometimes used as just literary narrative though <1> I don't read as much as I do play video games so that isn't the most relevant to me. <0> fiction is so cool though, pure creative imagination. <1> I know, it's only as good as they imagine it to be.
<0> I got accused of something at work today. <1> Im guessing it wasnt your fault? Do you know whos it was? <0> I wasn't even at work the day it happened,  yet they still insist it was me.
<0> Hi, I love Jazz, which is a music genre that originated in the African-American  <1> That is amazing, since when have this type of music been in existence  <0> For a long time actually, but it was in the 1920s through the Jazz Age, that jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. <1> I love it sometimes too but i am not familiar to any artiste that sings it. Do you know of any <0> Yes Ravi Bissambhar  is a Trinidadian chutney musician who makes jazz music! <1> Which of his song is the most popular. Maybe i could have heard of it before <0> Sangre Grande is one of his hit singles, and adds a tinge of Indian descent music! <1> I have heard of that. I'm very versed in most artists that play Jazz music.
<0> Have you been to Canada? <1> It has ten provinces and three territories  <0> i visit my sister every year in canada <1> I wish I could go visit someone.  If I don't get a job soon, the only place I'm going to go is out on the street. <0> Sorry to hear that. How long have you been looking for a job?
<0> Soccer actually.   <1> I love soccer the most!  In the US it's governed by the US Soccer Federation. Do you play? <0> I don't play now but I have in the past. <1> That sounds like fun and you're certainly not alone! There are 250 million players in over 200 countries! <0> I wonder which countries don't play. <1> Germany, New Zealand, Argentina, Australia, and Brazil to name a few! <0> What about Mexico? <1> Im rooting for Mexico in the next Olympics. <0> Ya I like tacos with guacamole.
<0> I was in a check out lane for a while waiting when another cashier comes alone and takes the people in the back of the line. <1> that is literally the worst,  the people should have atleast told you to go ahead  first! 
<0> Saturday I'm climbing Mt. Elbert the highest Mountain in the lower 48. The nerves has started to set in. <1> That's so cool! Do you do a lot of climbing?
<0> I now have a new boss,  and today was my first day of a leadership meeting with him.  You never know how you will be received. <1> Oh man,  that's so nerve-wracking. Do you think you guys will be a good fit? <0> He spent some time laying out his beliefs and his expectations,  and I have to say,  I agreed with all but one of them.  That's pretty good.  He spent a lot of time watching the rest of us interact with each other,  so I think he is trying to feel us out without making judgments yet. <1> Then it sounds like at least he has some perspective and ability to know not to overreact. I guess you could say you lucked out,  but that may be me speaking too prematurely
<0> how are you doing this fine evening ? <1> i'm well , retired and living my best life ! how about you ? <0> that is really great . i design video games <1> that sounds great . my grandkids would love that ! <0> it is great . they should check out my game starcraft . <1> i'll mention it to them . do you have any hobbies ? <0> i like to keep to myself . i'm a recluse . <1> i understand . i sew my own clothes so i could probably be a recluse too . <0> i like to make things too . i am working on a robot <1> that sounds very complicated . i hope it turns out well . <0> i want to use it as a body double <1> like an avatar or something ? <0> yeah something like that
<0> My hair is black. What color is your hair? <1> I have black hair, too! It's probably because it's the most common of all human hair colors across the entire globe. We're just a part of larger populations that have this dominant trait! <0> If you could change your hair color, what would it be? <1> I probably wouldn't. I'm happy with black hair. Although, hair coloring is definitely on the rise, as 75% of women and 18% of men in Copenhagen, for example, have reported dying their hair, if that gives you any indication. <0> I might dye my hair later in life, as my black hair is beginning to grey out. Would you? <1> I'm not so sure. But I understand if you would want to, in order to stand out. Especially if you lived in Asia, Eastern Europe, Latin America, Southern Europe, or Africa, no matter what your ethnolinguistic affiliation, you most likely have black hair as it's overwhelmingly common. 
<0> i felt lonely because i have never been left all by myself before <1> You should find something interesting to do. <0> like what <1> Go hand out with friends or host a night over sleep, that would be fun. <0> I would think about it, have you ever hold a sleep over with friends?

You stand out by NOT dying your hair. Black hair is least common among all ethnicities.
<0> This past month, due to my consistent exercising i gained 8 pounds of muscle mass with the help of Whey protein powder. I am so proud for my accomplishment <1> That's wonderful! Congratulations! What kind of program did you do? <0> I didn't do any specific program, I just paid a little extra on my membership to get a personal trainer! <1> Nice, what made you decide to get a trainer as opposed to finding a program yourself? <0> Having a trainer made me stay consistent and kept pushing me even when I wanted to quit. <1> That makes sense. Do you have any pets? <0> I have a dog. I want to get another so he's not so lonely. Do you have pets? <1> Yes, I'm a big fan of lizards so I own a few of those. What kind of dog do you own? <0> I have a German Shepherd, he's still a puppy. I got him for my girlfriend a few months ago, but she tells me she doesn't want him anymore. <1> That's too bad, I've always loved german shepherds, they're very smart.
<0> We can't afford to live in our home anymore <1> Why is that? <0> We're poor,  and bills are adding up <1> I am sorry to hear that,  I hope things improve for you a ton! <0> I am looking for a second job to help pay the bills.
<0> My girlfriend broke up with me <1> Did she give you a reason?
<0> i was just like the usual,  working on my website,  and then i saw a disgusting advert which was about society <1> Dont put too much weight into those advertisements. Sometimes they are just there to get a rise out of you.
<0> Last year my wife got into an accident and we only had one car and I was so worried we wouldn't have a car to get to work <1> Did you make special arrangements so things went smoothly with one car?
<0> My favorite kind of music is rock and roll. I like classic and modern rock. What about you? <1> i like Rock and roll because it developed from the music of gospel and blues in the 1940's and 1950's. <0> Yeah, I think Elvis had a lot to do with the invention of rock. Can you tell me about him? <1> Do you mean  Elvis Aaron Presley, the American singer and actor? <0> That's the one. I think his nickname was the king of rock 'n roll. <1> I had just heard of him being "The King".  There probably would not have been a Sun Records if not for Elvis and Sam Phillips. <0> He was revolutionary for his time. Many older people thought he was straight from the devil. <1> I would love to hear one of his 2 Sun Record recordings that did not survive.  There could have been a hit we never heard!!
<0> i love the fact that having brown hair makes me look like my favorite actor <1> Who is your favorite actor and I love brown hair I have it also mixed with a little sandy red. <0> Zac Efron, Brown hair is the second most common human hair color, after black hair <1> I agree because even though my hair is brown I usually wear black extension it just gives off a more sleek look. Have you wore your hair in any other colors? <0> no, my hair has always been brown. its strands are thicker than those of fair hair but not as much as those of red hair <1> Red hair that is fascinating besides your brown hair do you have other features of your favorite actor? <0> not really, also people with brown hair are often reffered as brunette's <1> Yes most of the brunettes's hair are more on the dark brown side but it is very pretty on women.
<0> What do you think of harley-davidson motorcycles? <1> Well I have not been around since they were founded in 1903, but since they seem to be a good company. <0> Have you ever ridden a motorcycle before? I have a motorcycle, but it's not a harley-davidson. <1> No, I have never ridden one. But I do love riding bicycles. The motorcycle originally came from bicycles. <0> That's so cool. I didn't know that. What kind of bicycle do you ride?  <1> Well I just have a street bike, but I would love to try mountain biking which focuses on off-road and rough terrain. <0> It sounds hard to do mountain biking, but I think I would still try it. My friend likes to mountain bike in Colorado. <1> Yeah it is hard but using a motorcycle on mountain slopes is far easier the last time i tried it.
<0> What t is type of show is that? <1> Jeopardy is an American show where you are quizzed on certain questions and things like that. <0> Do you watch it a lot <1> Yes I do, I like Ken Jennings who holds the record for earnings <0> Ken Jennings sounds very knowledgable?
<0> Why no response please? <1> Who are you waiting for a response from?
<0> What is your favorite number? <1> 7 is a cool number but i like 17 myself. <0> 7 is my favorite.  It's a powerful number. What do you like about 17? <1> I like that it isnt common and its my birthday day of the month, its a cool number. <0> 17 still has 7 in it so I like it too.  Do you have another favorite? <1> Besides the number 17? I like 8 too. <0> 8 is good, it's a round number.  I like 5 too. <1> I like the numebr 8 since it can be any number if adjusted on a calculator <0> Hmmm, that's interesting, I am not sure what you mean. <1> I understand,i also like it because I was born on the 8th day of the month.
<0> My dog was bit by something and had a huge front lip and looked really sad.  I felt terrible for him and was doing anything I could to help. <1> Like what?
<0> i have good memories when i see photos of my grandmother <1> Oh yea,  I can relate to the good times,  is she still alive?
<0> i got pets too . probably why i'm not married . lol <1> way she goes . tell me more about yourself <0> I love Fall, but my favorite season is Winter. It's great for sleeping in under a warm blanket! <1> Me too--i love the snow and i hate hot weather! <0> Tell me about it! So, what are you're hobbies? <1> I like skiing--I've done that since I was 5 years old, but haven't had much time recently. <0> Wow, that sounds awesome! How hard was it to learn? <1> My dad taught me when I was 5 so I don't totally remember, but I think the younger you are when you learn something the easier it is <0> That's what I've heard. I learned how to be anxious and sleep, haha! <1> heh, me too--I'm very good at both of those things now!  So what do you do for fun? <0> I like to play video games and try to write fantasy stories. How about you? <1> My too!  What are some of your favorite games? <0> Harvest Moon (all of them) and anything Mario. What systems do you play on? <1> Mainly PC--we have a PS4 but I'm much better on PC (plus the graphics are gorgeous).  Have you played Stardew Valley?
<0> is window shopping fun to do ? <1> yeah , but i prefer spending my time hiking and watch the sunset . <0> i just wanted to try it because my parents have no money to give me <1> i just got a pet fish for my 18th birthday yesterday from my parents . <0> my last birth day celebration was when am 3 years old . <1> you should celebrate more . what is your favorite color ? mine is orange ! <0> my parents who adopted after losing my biological ones are poor . <1> ah i feel you , my boyfriend broke up with me two months ago and i am sad . <0> Aw, that's too bad. My parents just gave me $100 to go shopping. 
<0> I was glad my dad asked me to go on a mission trip with him. <1> Nice! Where did you go? <0> Belize. He did doctor stuff. I didn't do much. But it was cool to see what they were up to. <1> Oh,  that is really cool! What a great experience,  and fun to bond with your dad! <0> I had to help him a lot in his work.
<0> I was going on a trip and couldn't take my dog so I had to board him and I was so worried about it. <1> Was he okay? <0> He was fine. I just didn't know how he was going to handle it,  he is a very nervous dog. <1> Well maybe if you do it a little more then he will be fine with it. I would be afraid just because he is afraid. <0> That's true. He was a rescue and sometimes I wonder if he was treated in a bad way and thats why he is like that. <1> Maybe so. It's good he has a good home now.
<0> I am so mad my neighbor killed my dog because she was mad at me. <1> What? Do you have evidence supporting this
<0> Interesting. Do you know where is Porsche originally from? <1> It's  a German car that specializes in sports cars, SUVs and sedans <0> i never really knew that i knew it was european <1> A lot of fancy cars are European <0> yeah i wonder if they cost as much out there <1> Probably a bit cheaper because they don't have to ship them overseas, but I'm not sure <0> alot of countries probably have different standards for their automobiles i wonder if they have to make american versions to ship out <1> Very true. My dad wants to buy a BMW in Germany and ship it back to the US personally  <0> wow is that cheaper to do or more expensive? <1> Not sure, probably more expensive but a fun experience/vacation. <0> definately my mom bought a volkswagon beetle in mexico and brought it here that was in the 60s though <1> I like Volkswagens too.  They are built to last.  That makes sense since they were used during World War II for military tanks. <0> yeah they are known to be reliable and good in the snow <1> Yes, my friend Joey Hoke had a Volkswagen and it was beast mode until we got pulled over by the police.
<0> I watched out the window for visitors to my house today,  it was saddening. <1> Did they not ever come? <0> No one came to visit.
<0> My friend and I both did a low-carb diet last month. She lost 8 pounds. I gained 2!  <1> Wow,  great for her! I am confused as to how you ended up GAINING though! <0> I dunno. Water weight? She looks so good now. I'm really envious.  <1> Well,  keep at it and you will get where you want to be. It really just comes down to how many calories you take in vs. how many calories you burn per day. <0> Do you think I will end up losing weight.
<0> My dad saved a piece of pizza for his lunch the next day. he was not happy when he woke up and checked the fridge. <1> Haha, did someone else eat the pizza?  Was that someone you? <0> lol I may have had something to do with it <1> I'm studying for a law degree do you want me to be your attourney and fight the case against your Dad ?lol <0> Hah I may need to take you up on that some day  <1> SO, what do you do in your spare time, aside from nightly fridge raids ? <0> I like to read, what about you?
<0> What kind of gas milage does the Civic have? <1> Not sure exactly but it is usually very good on gas. the first Civic came out in 1972 as a two door model and then a three door hatchback that same year. <0> 1972 was before I was even born <1> yes it was and i too like simpler times . do you have a car ? <0> I drive a blue Honda civic. <1> That is cool , they are really nice cars , what coloris it? <0> it is a pretty blue.  do you have a car? <1> Yes I have  chevy truck it is gold color, is your car good on gas ? <0> i bet it is better on gas than your chevy truck!  one of my four siblings also has a chevy truck <1> Yes I get 17 miles to a gallon has a big tank I only fill it up twice a month , is the gas high where you live? <0> I believe it was $2.58 per gallon when i fueled up my honda last.
<0> I really like baking.  One of the most common things to bake is bread. <1> Do you know when baking first originated? <0> I do not know when it was first originated.  I would assume a long time ago though!  I do know in the past baking was typically performed by women in the house. <1> What are the main baked good that are popular around the world? <0> Breads are the most common and important foods.  Both from an economic and cultural point of view.  Cake's and pastries are popular as well but bread is by far the most popular. <1> What is the process of making bread? <0> Bread is normally prolonged in dry heat, typically in an oven.  It can also be made in hot ashes or on hot stones. <1> How did early bakers bake their good? <0> They would typically use a fire pit or make a clay like stove.  Heat would be transferred from the surface to the breads centre. <1> How did you get into baking?
<0> bakers love to make breads and other stuff using an oven  <1> Yes they do. Are you a baker ? Do you like baking ? <0> yes I am, i work in a bakery <1> That sounds like an interesting job. I myself love going to the bakery. My favorite bakery item is strawberry shortcake <0> In Rome, big households had their own bakers <1> That is so cool. i am imagining all of the wonderful, delicious, homemade baked good i would ask for,  if i had my  very own baker
<0> I do agree! What is your favorite orange-flavored soft drink? <1> I like Sunkist Orange the best I think. I never knew they are called "soft" drinks because it's a contrast with "hard" alcoholic drinks.  <0> Wow, what an interesting fact. I never considered that but it makes sense. <1> I love those weird types of facts. I usually drink soft drinks with caffeine, I have a Coke with me all the time. <0> Oh yes I love Dr. Pepper. Coke is a close second but I'll never drink Pepsi. <1> isn't it weird how people love either Coke or Pepsi? Not many people will admit to liking both. <0> I find the world to be a very divisive place these days. That analogy could be made about politics as well. We could all use more unity. <1> I agree, maybe Coke and Pepsi could be the start and call a truce in the cola wars, lol! <0> It would have an impact! lol Sony and Microsoft finally stopped bickering and started working together. <1> exactly that would be amazing, people need to be reminded that we are more alike than not
<0> Do you ever go to nightclubs?  I have always wanted to go to Carolines on Broadway.  Have you heard of it? <1> Not anymore, but I've heard that Louis C.K. performed there in the past. <0> I did not know that.  I do remember seeing him on HBO's One Night Stand.  He was pretty funny. <1> Yes, he is funny! He deserved each and every Emmy award won over the years. <0> Yeah he has been on Saturday Night Live three or four times.  Hilarious each time! <1> Do you remember Tracey Ullman? She was funny also. I didn't know she had a brief singing career <0> Neither did I.  I remember she had her own show The Tracey Ullman Show, and she appeared on The Simpsons. <1> The Simpsons huh? I didn't know that. Her show lasted 4 seasons on HBO.
<0> Yes, I have! I love them. They look so luxurious!  Have you ever ridden in one? <1> I never have, but I am a car fanatic and have looked at famous models, especially the historic sports-racing Bentley 41/2 and Bentley Speed Six.  I have done a lot of research on the company and hope to one day own my dream car. <0> We rode in one once.  To a funeral.  High class.  Was afraid to touch anything. <1> That is what is keeping me from purchasing one. My dog is my #1 sidekick and he sheds so that is a problem. <0> Dogs are man's best friend lol.  We're going to the opera next week.  Madame Butterfly.  For the 15th time. <1> Wow you must really be fans.  Is it a dinner and date night? Any good restaurant suggestions that aren't vegan? <0> Yes, but just a quick trip.  We're flying into NYC, staying for about 3 days.  Then back home. <1> I visited NYC this summer.  I liked it! I like the business of it. <0> Busy place.  Need to set up reservations at good hotels to really experience the city.  Worth the money.
<0> My wife was sick all last week,  so I had to stick by her side. <1> what did she get sick off ,  im sorry to hear that your a great to your wife
<0> One time I was building a tower of cards that was over 8 layers tall. It fell when someone walked by <1> oh my god,  did it take a lot of work? and did it annoy you when it fell down?
<0> we are getting by . i sing sometimes to cope . mostly in the shower , lol . <1> is it good singing or bad ? would people wait in line to hear you ? <0> I thnk people would wait in line to hear me sing <1> That is great! I am not a big fan of waiting in line. My patience <0> being patient is always a good thing. <1> I do hear that. I just have no patience for long lines and crowds <0> I understand just breath.  what about driving and road blocks <1> I also like to sing, it calms my anxiety. Road blocks, hmmm traffic and road blocks really test me
<0> hello there how are you today ? <1> hi ! i am here . wish i was there . <0> its cool here , its a house i live in <1> nice , i do as well . do you skate ? i do . did . i broke my arm . <0> yeah i actually do , i have only broken a few bones though <1> my friends and i are trying to go pro . <0> cool , whats your favourite fast food ? <1> dude , i am in cali , we eat local . as in what we pull out of the ocean . <0> mine is fries and hamburgers , not soda though <1> I was most of my time spend in ocean
<0> I ordered a surface pro yesterday! its gonna be so cool to play around with when it arrives <1> That's cool. I've always been a Mac kind of girl,  but I would look into a Surface is I was in the market for a new computer. <0> i only ever wanted one cause they can do the same stuff a regular computer can but also touch screen so you can draw on it,  i always got discouraged drawing on paper cause id waste so much of it,  and then just stop <1> I get that. I got a bamboo tablet a few years ago,  but I feel like working directly on the screen would be even better. <0> It is. New technology is always exiting.
<0> Something is under my bed and keeps me up at night! <1> What!? My god sounds like a horror movie. You better move.  <0> I'm convinced it's some sort of spirit! <1> That is terrifying have you looked under there? <0> No!  I'm too afraid.  What's if it's something terrible and I have to move?  I love my neighborhood.  There are tons of great vegan restaurants. <1> It could just be a rodent or something. I'm a pest controller you would be surprised at some of my stories. <0> I hadn't thought about that!  What's the scariest thing you've ever found on a job? <1> Giant rats are pretty scary to some people. I kind of hate my job though I want to quit and explore the world. <0> I don't blame you.  What's your dream vacation? <1> I want to visit the great barrier reef. Have you heard of it? <0> I've heard of it but have never been.  You should go! <1> I think I just might. I hope you figure out whatever is under your bed.
<0> I love to color my hair every month, its so much fun. Are you interested in coloring your hair too? What would you like to know?  <1> I've been thinking of coloring my hair but I can't decide between letting a professional do it, or do it myself. What do you think? <0> Well since most hair coloring is done by a professional hairdresser id go with that but you can always do it at home.  <1> It would probably be cheaper if I did!  Coloring one's hair is a popular thing to do, isn't it? <0> hair coloring is super popular, I know that over 75% of women and 18% of men dye their hair according to a study by the University of Copenhagen. <1> Wow, that's amazing!  I guess noone is happy with their original color!  LOL  I wonder why so many people color their hair?
<0> sometimes , but i do like swimming in pool and running . <1> i prefer not to do stuff like that , but i do like traveling . <0> where is the last place you traveled? <1> I went to Canada. It is my favorite place to travel. Have you been somewhere fun? <0> not really i dont travel much i work a lot but i love the summer still because i get to do other activities to stay active <1> Yeah the summer is definitely the best season for being active.
<0> I am still in shock at the damage yesterdays flood caused.  <1> Was any of your stuff damaged?
<0> Obesity is the number one problem now days. It's going to kill more people then cancer. <1> Oh it absolutely is, 40% of adult Americans are obese, it's having a negative effect on our society as a whole. <0> It seems like I'm seeing more and more very heavy people at younger and younger ages. <1> Yeah obesity in the united states is a serious health issue. 1 in 3 people in America are Pre-Diabetic or Diabetic. <0> Being Diabetic is no joke. No one wants to loose their feet. <1> Exactly, it can cause diabetic nephropathy, your nerves basically eat themselves. <0> That's horrible. I don't think the rest of the world have the issues with Obesity as we do. <1> I think some countries do.
<0> When my son was born,  we knew that something was up before he came out.  It was pretty scary. <1> Did he have superpowers? <0> Hah - no.  But he did have the cord wrapped around his neck twice,  and he'd tied an overhand knot in it,  too. <1> That's pretty impressive.
<0> Here in Florida the traffic and wrecks is bad and always happening.  <1> I hate bad traffic,  did you get in an accident?
<0> Any time a hear a sound of a fun I become reminiscent of good old times.  <1> it's true there's nothing like the good old days <0> Of course,  only for the people that lived through them <1> i'm glad you were one of them! <0> Oh how times have changed. Nowadays people just focus on the present.

<0> Hello, have you colored your hair before? It is practice of changing the hair color <1> Yes, I have. I have done so for many years. <0> I don't know what your reasons must have been. Anyways,   a primary reason is to cover gray or white hair, to change to a color regarded as more fashionable or desirable <1> Yes, that is why I do it now. I have some grays that I cover to blend with the rest of my hair. Do you color your hair? <0> Of course, I have some white hair as well, I usually do it at home with the help of my loving wife and sometimes through the services of a professional at a salon  <1> I prefer to use a professional. Do you have any advice about hair coloring? <0> Oh well, there is no big deal about doing this. About  $1.9 billion was spent for this alone  in 2011 in  USA
<0> A few of my co-workers said they'd be absent next week <1> Oh my,  I hope that doesn't mean more workload for you. <0> Yeah,  I hope we don't get a ton of work while they're gone <1> Maybe you should ask for overtime pay just in case you do get more work! <0> I might, that's not a bad idea.
<0> Hey so what do you like about Jazz? <1> I really like the whole style of Jazz genre, the whole culture evolving around African-American Communities and New Orleans is amazing to me. <0> And who are some of your favorite Jazz musicians ? <1> I have to say Miles Davis. It's just jazz is magical because it's considered "America's classical music". Miles is a perfect example of that. <0> Miles Davis is great example. What period of jazz do you relate with the most ? <1> 1920s was a jazz age so I really like it. 20s and 30s jazz. <0> Yeah early Jazz . I like the swing ear love the vibe.  <1> Yeah, some of those dudes could really play the sax.
<0> When i proposed to my girlfriend,  she said yes! I was so happy <1> well that's great news congratulations,  how long have you known each other? <0> We have known each other for 7 years,  and been dating for 5 - felt like the right time <1> that's good that you put a lot of effort into it <0> We both put in a lot of effort.
<0> I am obese due to having excess body fat. <1> I am overweight as well <0> My body mass index is way to high. <1> Have you tried a low carb diet.  That is what I am on and it has helped me lose some weight <0> Yes, I have tried the diet that restricts my carbohydrates. <1> I find it to be a pretty easy diet to follow and you can find alot of good recipes on Pinterest as well
<0> i ate 3 pizzas just earlier and i feel so good and relaxed now,  almost tranquility <1> I think I am missing something,  you said you feel more that ok after 3 pizzas??? <0> yeah i know right,  a lot,  and i am pretty thin so i shouldnt feel ok,  But i totally do feel great .
<0> i felt happy this morning because it was sunny and warm <1> That's always a great start to a day. <0> absolutely,  i was overjoyed <1> How are you celebrating it? <0> I am just soaking up the sun and reading a book.
<0> yea its so tasty with all the spices and stuff. <1> The herbs and spices are what make the food so damn good. <0> Food without having any added just tastes nasty to me, and disappoints me like my life sometimes. <1> I like lots of flavor too. I recently discovered Indian food and I love the spiciness of it.  <0> I couldn't eat spicy food, as that would tear my stomach up too much. <1> I just tried it recently and I love it! Certainly wouldnt give scaps to a pet though.  <0> Yes alot of herbs and spicys could make a pet very sick, reminds me that I wish I could be a animal sometimes.
<0> I saw a psychiatrist for the first time yesterday. It was alright,  but I have to admit I was a bit skeptical at first. <1> I have considered it myself but feel the same as you. Will you go back again?  <0> I might. It just makes me a little uneasy having to share personal information with a total stranger. <1> right,  i feel you but maybe it will be good to get it all out!!  <0> I love to share all my secrets and personal stuffs to the strangers.

<0> Oh I love to watch people salsa but have no idea how to do it myself <1> You know, it's actually not as old as people may think. It, along with Salsa music, comes from 1970s New York, with origins from the Puerto Rican bomba and plena, Cuban Son, cha-cha-cha, mambo, and others. So, it's kind of an amalgamation. <0> That's really interesting, does this mean you're an expert? <1> I'm not an expert in Salsa.  I like to watch it but I have no rhythm at all.  Do you like to dance? <0> I'm not very good, but I do find it's a good way to meet new people! <1> Yes, dancing can create the human connection that is usually lacking on social media.

<0> I am so happy the houses in my neighborhood are far apart <1> You dont like your neighbors? <0> It's not that I don't like them, I just really like having room to mess around and play without bothering anyone. <1> I know what you mean. Like play loud music or having BBQs at night for apparent reason <0> Lol, I'm kind of the opposite, I like building projects and the noise can bother people sometimes. I also like the quiet so I can focus on my hobbies. <1> What's your hobbies? I like to go hiking on the weekends <0> I like woodworking a lot, I have way too many birdhouses in my garage. How is hiking? It seems pretty dangerous to me. <1> It can be but doesn't have to go all extreme hiking, you can do slow starts <0> I can't really imagine a scenario where hiking would be dangerous.
<0> I am sad my cousin is moving away. <1> Is it really far?

Oops! <1> Well you must have really liked that pizza!! <0> Yeah I was starving, so what are your plans for tomorrow? <1> i work as a vet so no days off over here! <0> Yeah I can imagine you must be very busy. I wouldn't be able to handle your job, I have a phobia of snakes. <1> luckily I love my job, even when the snakes come in <0> Yuck. Bugs I can handle, but snakes are a whole new level. It must be a rewarding job. <1> yes i really love animals, enough that they caused me to go vegan! <0> I'm not sure I would be able to handle that. I love chicken way too much!
<0> do you ever just feel so grateful that you're alive? <1> Yes,  I feel that every day. <0> it's the most amazing feeling ever right? it feels like the universe gives us everything. <1> I wish people understood how precious life really is. <0> Yeah! Most people don´t do. What do you appreciate most in life?
<0> Hey i had a lot of fun graduating! <1> Congratulations on your graduation! You must be so proud. <0> I am so proud, you can not even imagine. <1> You should be. I bet you worked very hard and you earned it. Everyone must be so proud of you. <0> They are! Thank you so much!  <1> You're welcome and I wish you all the luck.

<0> Hi, the color red, which is at the end of the visible spectrum of light, is my favorite color.  <1> I like red too. What other colors do you enjoy? <0> I also like purple, which is a color intermediate between blue and red. it reminds me of the sunset. <1> That's beautiful. What color is at the beginning  of the spectrum? <0> Indigo is a deep and rich color close to the color wheel blue and it lies somewhere at the beginning of the spectrum. <1> Okay how many colors are on the spectrum? <0> There are numerous variations of the color along the spectrum. Potentially thousands! <1> Wow. I'm surprised I didn't know that. I love colors. Is black on the spectrum?
<0> Hi, I love Target can you tell me more about it? <1> Sure! I know that Target is the second-largest discount retailer in the U.S., behind Walmart! <0> Wow, does Target have groceries for sale like Walmart? <1> Many of their stores do. They were originally called Goodfellow Dry Goods back in 1902, and carried all sorts of things - including food. <0> Why do you think Target is a better store than Walmart? <1> I find that, even though they offer cheap products like Walmart, their stuff is a little more chic. Cheap-chic!
<0> I love pasta. It is a staple item usually known to be associated with Italian food. It dates back to 1154 in Sicily. <1> Pasta is my favorite food!!! I could eat it for every meal, but I like my absolute favorite dish is fettuccine alfredo!  <0> Pasta is divided in two categories. Dried pasta (Secca) and fresh(pasta fresca. <1> That's interesting! It's also interesting how many other cultures have made pasta a part of their cuisine. Like Italian, Asian food uses a lot of different pastas.  <0> Dried pasta is known to be commercially produced that goes through an extrusion processthough it can be produced in a home. <1> I would love to get a pasta maker to make my own pasta. Have you ever tried making pasta? <0> Based upon location in Italy pasta pasta shapes or types often differ. <1> Oh really, I will definitely check it out.

What type of pastas do you like to make? <0> Angel hair is always a great one to use in standard Italian cuisine. <1> Yes! I prefer angel hair in spaghetti instead of the traditional spaghetti noodles. Do you make different pasta dishes?  <0> One of my favorite pasta dishes is just standard meat sauce and angel hair pasta. <1> Nice! Do ever put garlic or onions in your dishes? <0> I love garlic in my standard Italian pasta dishes. <1> The more garlic the better. Garlic has a lot of health benefits.Do you put any vegetable in your pastas? <0> No I really like to eat it without veggies 
<0> NASA released some free space posters a couple of months back. <1> Okay! Now that is interested,  I would love to see them. <0> I think they have them up on their website,  you should give them a look! I had them printed for a small fee and now they're up on my wall! <1> Oh really? I will be checking it out. I would love to have some. <0> Yup. The poster files are free,  you just have to get them printed somewhere. They have a few different themes. I got Europa,  Trappist-1e,  Mars Explorers Wanted and "We Need You" <1> Free?

A little too much to drink? <0> What did you do ? <1> well, I'm not that crazy about my current job, so I've been on-line searching for other jobs. that's about it for me. Your story sounds juicy! details! :-) <0> I got in to touble because my wife was there to and some of them got mad a <1> eyes wide open - wow. I should think not. however, there's always scandal at the reunions - that's why people go... to find out all the details. spill it! <0> she was so drunk she did not know if she was coming or going so I slipped off away from the wif  <1> Scan-da-lous! well, I'm exploring this conversation. This is like reality TV here. But, at least it seems like you feel bad about it. that means.... <0> not really found out the wife had a blast with old boyfriend
<0> I like going to the beach, but havent gone in years since my kids were born. id love to take them soon <1> I agree that the beach is a wonderful place to take children. Oceans compose much of our planet's hydrosphere. <0> Do you live near the beach? <1> I used to, but my girlfriend and I just bought a new house that's closer to her parents <0> I've never lived more than 30 minutes from the coast <1> Oh wow, that's pretty cool. Do you go to the beach often? <0> I like to run and I try to run on the beach at least once a week <1> I used to run, but now I spend most of my time taking care of my pregnant girlfriend. <0> Yea it can be hard to find time but it's so worth it if you can manage <1> Once the baby is born hopefully we can take it to the beach
<0> Oh yeah,  very comfortable and light <1> I have heard that in French, crochet means small hook. <0> I have no idea. <1> Yeah, I have been working on a blanket recently out of granny squares.  <0> Oh good.

I get confused between my studying for the test and for my show sometimes. <1> Yeah I got an old car from my dad that kept breaking down when I was in college! Are you singing in the show? <0> Why yes as well as dancing too. Do you have a better car now?

<0> I am so happy the houses in my neighborhood are far apart <1> You dont like your neighbors? <0> It's not that I don't like them, I just really like having room to mess around and play without bothering anyone. <1> I know what you mean. Like play loud music or having BBQs at night for apparent reason <0> Lol, I'm kind of the opposite, I like building projects and the noise can bother people sometimes. I also like the quiet so I can focus on my hobbies. <1> What's your hobbies? I like to go hiking on the weekends <0> I like woodworking a lot, I have way too many birdhouses in my garage. How is hiking? It seems pretty dangerous to me.
<0> I think I'm going to move my mother into my house with us. <1> O? That's a brave and noble decision.
<0> My favorite super hero is Superman. Can you tell me anything about him? <1> Yea he mostly appears in American comic books published by DC Comics. <0> Cool when was the first Superman comic made? <1> Long time ago! Superman debuted in "Action Comics" #1 in June 1938)  <0> Wow that is a long time ago. I have seen all of the movies. I really liked Christopher Reeves as him. <1> Do you prefer him by the name Big Blue Boy Scout or the Man of Steel?
<0> My son starts kindergarten soon. He is my first one. <1> I remember when my first child started,  I was a nervous wreck. <0> They sent out an email saying that he may end up with a substitute teacher until they hire someone. 
<0> I once had a party when I was a teenager.  My parents were out of town. <1> Haha everyone has to do that once. Can you tell me a great story about the party?

<0> I love all kinds of music, but classic rock & roll is definitely a go-to. Crazy that elements of it can be heard in blues records from the 1920s! <1> I love rock as well! I think my favorite band is Motley Crue <0> Whoohoo! That's going classic hair band ;-) You're in the company of LOTS of fans -- they've sold more than 100 million records worldwide! <1> That is awesome! I remember they had crazy hair back in the day. <0> SO many of those bands did! It's tough to see that their music has roots in blues, you know? A backbeat and a drum....music!  <1> I have heard that all rock has roots in blues, Do you know if that is true? <0> Absolutely. I love when bands like the Beatles and Rolling Stones acknowledge the influence that blues had on them -- music originated by African Americans in the Deep South inspired some major classic hits! <1> I remember my dad telling me about a guy named Stevie Ray. He said that guy was amazing
<0> Superman is my favorite superhero, do you know anything about him? <1> Yeah, I was kind of a Superman nerd back in the day as a kid. I think everyone was. But I REALLY got into it. As a part of the DC Comics universe, one of the most iconic comic book characters.. he was created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, writer and artist respectively, while they were still in high school! <0> Ok cool so what can you tell me about him that I may not know? <1> Well, as you may have imagined, he was the superhero who kind of started it all. His success in the years since he was created in 1933, he helped usher in the classic superhero archetype and set its primacy within the American comic book. He's an icon for a reason. <0> If I remember the story he grew up in Kansas right? <1> Right you are! Technically born in Kal-El, planet Krypton, and then sent to Earth as an infant. This was due to his father, Jor-El, sending him there before the planet's destruction. From there, he was raised on a farm in Kansas! Raised as Clark Kent, with a strong moral compas. <0> And I think he was adopted by an older couple if I remember correctly <1> I think you may know more about Superman than you think! It was an older farm couple, right. And they raised him, and through his childhood he kind of dropped hints of his powers here and there, through different abilities, and then when he turned into an adult he fully grew into his superhero identity and started using his powers to save mankind. <0> You certainly know a lot. Do you remember what Superman's human name was?
<0> Do you know anyone struggling with alcohol and trying to gain sobriety to not have measurable levels of alcohol. <1> I actually do. It is a difficult struggle. Do you know someone as well? <0> Not really, but I am usually a person in a state considered sober. I feel like drugs just do more harm than anything. <1> I agree. It is not something I can imagine dealing with personally! <0> Do you know about Eminem and his sixth studio album Relapse? He struggles with sobriety. <1> I didn't know that. It is a very common and widespread problem it seems.
<0> Hey do you go to the gym? <1> Yes I do. The act of fitness before the industrial revolution was looked at as the ability to complete a days activities without being fatigued. <0> That's great! What types of workout's do you do at the gym? <1> I do whatever keeps my body in shape. Fitness is known as the quality of being fit and being in that state of mind. <0> So, how many days a week do you go to the gym? <1> Usually 4 days a week. The modern definition of fitness is labeled as the abiltiy is a human or machines specific function or holistic of adaptability to cope with various incidents or situations. <0> You know so much about physical fitness, I am trying to get my body more in shape after having 7 children. <1> Not an easy task but determination will pay off. Physical fitness is achieved by eating proper nutrition, rest and various rigorous exercise. <0> I agree, it must be really difficult working out so often.
<0> I told my sister in law that I would help her with her books. After this last one,  I felt bad because I told her I couldn't anymore. <1> That's rough. Why can't you help her? <0> I just have too much going on now with two kids,  and working from home. <1> Yeah,  I am in the same boat. It's a hard knock life out there. <0> since I am free, do you want to grab a beer?
<0> I have brown hair that's so light that when you look at it under certain types of light, it looks blonde! <1> Hey, me too!  It is pretty common to have brown hair, you know.  It's the second most common color. <0> I don't know if I want to be common though. Should I dye it so it's not brown anymore? <1> Well if you want to get away from brown hair, why not try an unnatural color like cadet blue or purple? <0> Because if I dye it cadet blue, I'm worried that means I'll have to join the Air Force. <1> Oh!  you could perhaps move away from Europe and North America and move to, say Japan where it is way less common.  You'd stand out more!
<0> Hi! My favorite food is pasta! I could eat it everyday. How about you? <1> Me too! I love Pastas that are  dried and I sometimes like fresh pasta too. Whats your favorite kind? <0> Awesome! I love rigatoni!  It's great with a white sauce! <1> Me too, I love the fine ridges that go down their length, sometimes spiraling around the tube. it makes me so hungry just thinking about it.  <0> Yes! Is all pasta originally from Italy? Do you know? I want to try authentic Italian pasta. <1> Pasta is actually a staple of Italy and is a true food of traditional Italian cuisine, It originated way back in 1154 in Sicily if I'm not mistaken.  <0> Fascinating! Do you know how long it took for the cuisine to spread across the globe? <1> Not sure but  in Italy the names of specific pasta shapes or types often vary but after about 100 years after it was invented it was eventually brought to the US. I am not sure on the exact date. 
<0> I have black hair. Not surprising because I'm Asian...you?" <1> Uhmm ,I have black hair too... <0> well, it's a dominant trait, so I guess it's pretty common <1> Yeah it is...as they say black is beauty.How about red hair? <0> Red hair is pretty rare...just 1-2% of humans. Makes for good ginger jokes though <1> OK ,what race is red hair associated with? <0> I just know northern European. Probably Irish <1> OK ,what's the origin of black hair?
<0> hello how is it going ? <1> hi . i am doing well , plotting to take over the world . <0> haha i have read a book about that once <1> my kids do not visit , so i have a lot of time on my hands , after work . <0> oh my kid days are over finally <1> mine are too . i am 56 . <0> do you get to travel a lot ? i'm 60 <1> no , i used too when i was younger and a painter . <0> very sad kids don't visit as they should <1> no , they never do . i guess they are embarrassed about me not being pretty . <0> who is your favorite artist ? i am sure u look well
<0> Which is your favourite character from the Avenger movies?  <1> I love all of them. And their famous battle cry of "Avengers Assemble is awesome <0> It is pretty awesome. What did you think of the Black Panther movie? <1> I loved it a lot. I went to see it with my boyfriend when it was new. <0> That movie was casted perfectly. I really hope they make a sequel. <1> I do too. I always hope that they'll film a blockbuster movie where I live but I don't think they'll ever come to Portland. <0> Oregon? I could see something getting filmed out there. All you have to do is pitch it to the right person. ;) <1> That's true. The trouble is knowing the right person. Hahaha. <0> Yea, it's tough to start finding that. I usually just go through social media until I get a good lead. <1> That sounds like a plan for sure. I will have to try it out some time. <0> Perseverance is the key, as with anything. I know you can do it!
<0> hey , it is nice to chat with you today . how are you doing ? <1> doing well , just got off of work at my new job at the gas station . <0> oh nice . do you like it there ? i am actually chatting from a juvenile detention center . <1> it is a job for now . i really prefer working with plants and gardening . <0> ah , i understand . i wish i had thought like you before i decided to shoplift . <1> how long do you have to stay in the center ? my parents would kill me . <0> i am here for another month . my parents were pretty upset about the whole thing . <1> my parents adopted me when i was young . they were older and old fashioned . <0> ohh . i'm pretty luck i'd say . my mom is visiting me tomorrow . <1> that is awesome . are you scared there ? i'm so scared of clowns .

<0> cool , i've a moped , its chill to drive <1> where are you from now ? <0> I'm from Texas. How about you? <1> i'm from mississippi . just moved back here from austin texas <0> Ahh! You must of seen moped's around Austin. I would imagine it would be an easy way to get around for college kids. <1> I remember seeing some on the street that just looked like motorized bikes. <0> My oldest son is in College and he wants an electric scooter to get to classes on the other side of campus. What made you leave Austin? <1> the shed . we had some leaks , and broken trees . half the town got torn apart . <0> Oh wow! I am sorry to hear that. How is Mississippi treating you? <1> Pretty good so far. How about you? <0> I have only driven through Mississippi. Texas is typical bipolar weather Texas. It's in the 40's and raining. I was wearing shorts 3 days ago though <1> I always wear shorts everywhere.
<0> Red is my favorite color. You see it everywhere! I love laser pointers because they're almost always red. <1> Red pigment made from ochre was one of the first colors used in prehistoric art <0> That's...true. Don't think they had many laser pointers back then though. I'm excited that we may be going to Mars, the red planet, soon! <1>  The Ancient Egytians and Mayans colored their faces red in ceremonies it has always been a popular color <0> Maybe the Mars Exploration Rovers would have had more success if they were driven by Ancient Egyptians and Mayans. <1> Red is an important color in China, where it was used to colour early pottery and later the gates and walls of palaces. <0> whatever  red  color  is  important  i do not  like  it  . 
<0> I spent some time with my middle daughter by taking her to ice cream. She is so sweet and lovely. We had a very special time.  <1> That's great that you had such a good time. You sound like a good parent! <0> I try to be! I do get distracted easily though, so I have to work more on always keeping my eye on them. <1> i understand. been there. done that. got the tshirt. i am an empty nester. <0> lol, congrats on that! I'm really dreading the teenage years. For now, I need to get more serious about school. <1> don't worry about the teenage years. just keep reminding them that you love them. wow! and you are going to school, too? <0> I am. I'm studying online for my MBA. It's not easy, but I'll get used to it I'm sure. Gotta have faith! <1> once you complete it, it will be sssoooo worth it. hang in there. you got this. i am learning how to build websites myself. <0> Oh that sounds fun. I had to do that for a Management Information Systems class when I was an undergraduate. I enjoyed it. <1> it is fun once i can wrap my head around the concept. javascript is a little bit of a challenge for me. <0> I don't remember a whole lot about the class now, other than going to View and then Source was a constant.
<0> I would be in bad shape if I didn't pack extra clothes. <1> What are you packing extra clothes for? Did you go somewhere did something happen?
<0> When I was a teenager I used to borrow my big sisters clothes without her knowledge.  One time she had just bought a lovely new dress after saving all her wages.  That weekend I borrowed it and of course ripped it!  The next day when she found out she was so angry and i felt terrible. <1> Oh no! I hope she's forgiven you since then. <0> oh yes she has,  it was a while ago now but at the time the guilt was awful.  Needless to say I learnt my lesson and never borrowed her clothes again!
<0> An eagle landed on my flag pole in my front yard last week! <1> That is awe inspiring,  very patriotic.  Did you get pictures?
<0> what are you doing up this late <1> i was cooking ! what about you ? <0> i'm walking my dogs <1> this late ! i'm just practicing my cooking . how old are you ? <0> yes this late can you make tacos <1> yes ! i love tacos ! there's not much i do not like , i'm 23 <0> where do you live <1> i live in oregon for now but i've been all over the world this year . <0> have you been alabama <1> yes . the tacos there were amazing ! where do you live ?
<0> I have purple hair :D <1> wow that is awesome what made you want to get purple hair <0> Honestly, I lost a bet lol. Hair coloring is the practice of changing hair into various colors, and I got stuck with that one. Thanks friends <1> hahah that is funny and really interesting can you tell me mroe about the color purple
<0> I have brown hair that's so light that when you look at it under certain types of light, it looks blonde! <1> Hey, me too!  It is pretty common to have brown hair, you know.  It's the second most common color. <0> I don't know if I want to be common though. Should I dye it so it's not brown anymore? <1> Well if you want to get away from brown hair, why not try an unnatural color like cadet blue or purple? <0> Because if I dye it cadet blue, I'm worried that means I'll have to join the Air Force. <1> You can choose any color you like
<0> Have you ever heard of Chronic fatigue syndrome? <1> I have! My aunt suffered with it for many years. She was diagnosed based on her symptoms, I don't think a clear diagnostic test exists. Have you known anyone who's had it? <0> I have not, it sounds like something that would be awful, what are some of the characteristics of it? <1> It's fatigue that is not due to strenuous exertion and rest doesn't really provide much relief. It's not due to a previous medical condition, so its cause remains somewhat of a mystery. <0> Oh no, that is awful, so I assume they have no cure for it then <1> No, unfortunately not. There is no cure and no medications or procedures to treat CFS have been approved in the US. 
<0> I am watching the last season of game of thrones <1> thats awesome. dont spoil anything, okay? :D <0> No way. Do you watch it very often? <1> I've actually been waiting to binge watch several at once. <0> That's the best way to watch a series.  I like to watch shows while I'm walking on the treadmill.  Takes my mind off exercise. <1> And it also keeps you from having to wait till the next week to see what happens. Karate is good exercise. Have you ever tried it? <0> No, I haven't.  Do you practice karate?  It looks like fun.  <1> I do it's great fun actually, so long as you respect the sport and people.
<0> hi , how are you doing today ? <1> good . i'm a cashier at the local supermarket , you ?
<0> I am about to leave on a 17 hour car trip with my husband,  our four kids,  and 2 dogs. I think I have everything ready to go though <1> You can never be too prepared! I am sure you have got everything.
<0> Superman is a great super hero, don't you think? <1> Superman is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books <0> Yeah, he's been a classic for decades <1>  The character was created by writerYes I agree, Superman was created by Jerry Siegel and artist Joe Shuster <0> I see, I wonder if they were well compensated <1> Of course they were, They sold Superman to Detective Comics, the future DC Comics, in 1938 <0> I didn't know that, how interesting! <1> It would shock you to know that they were just high school kids when they created the characted
<0> When you're realllllyyyyy hungry you seriously can't beat pasta.  I love spaghetti and meatballs, and linguine, and lasagna.  Do you like pasta and have you ever tried to make it? <1> It is my absolute favorite, but no I've never tried to make the noodles. <0> I recently discovered how delicious Bolognese sauce is with pasta too.  Its a meat-based sauce and if you can get an original Italian recipe it's amazing! <1> My mother in law is Italian.  She makes some amazing dishes. <0> Oh you're so lucky!  I bet you guys have the best holiday's!  This is making me so hungry right now too! <1> The best!  But then we all need to fast for 3 days after! <0> Completely understandable, but you can't deny delicious food!  Luckily Eid al-Fitr is always there for us with a month of fasting!  <1> She literally makes so much food, we all take home enough for 4 more meals. <0> Wow mom's always take care of the family!!  Sounds like you guys needs a food policy! hahaha
<0> I love to eat hot peppers. <1> The chili pepper or also known as chili is a fruit of plants from the Capsicum family of the nightshade family. <0> Capsicum I've heard of that.  How do they measure how hot a pepper is? <1> They can be used for many different cuisines to add spiceness for food dishes. <0> They absolutely do.

Do you enjoy rock concerts?
<0> The pigeons keep coming into the house a pooping all over the place! <1> That's gross,  why are they coming in? <0> Well they are actually my pet pigeons. They are the beautiful white ones with a fan tail. But they sometimes like to come inside to see if they can munch on anything. <1> You should probably avoid feeding them if you want a clean house. <0> I love them too much to stop feeding them. It would be irresponsible of me since I took them in from someone who abused them.
<0> That's just it, she wasn't when we had a cat!  So I don't understand it - her eyes swelled shut almost and itched horribly. <1> oh wow! It sounds like it was a reaction that progressed rapidly. Did it require medical attention? <0> Yes it did. Nearly scrubbed the skin off in the shower. The allergy is horrible <1> How long did it take to improve? <0> Difference was seen in 5 days but lots of topical ointment and scratching and puffy eyes. It was horrible <1> How has she been doing since then? <0> Great!

What do you do in your spare time? <0> I am studying to get into graduate school <1> Hate studying.  I enjoy cooking in my spare time. <0> Yeah cooking is a vibe, but sometimes we have to do what we don´t want to in this life <1> Responsibility is a life goal.  Work first then play. <0> Yeah but too much work can mess up the mind <1> Too much of anything can make me crazy. <0> I like to be alone sometimes, but the quietness can make me crazy <1> I enjoy quiet times, but find that volunteering makes me feel better.

Do you know how many types of pasta there are? <0> There are about 310 different shapes of pasta <1> What?! That's crazy, it's so many. Is there a reason for all the different shapes? Do they all taste the same? <0> It all depends on the location that they were made. Some villages call a certain shape of pasta a different name than another village. <1> Wow, that's so interesting. Do you know if people always used to make the tomato sauce to add to the pasta? Or were there different recipies?

And he even likes his clay model. lol I've also made a clay model of mount Everest as I hope to climb it someday! <1> Wow, that would be a huge accomplishment if you did it! <0> Indeed. Although it would take a long time to prep considering the danger and conditions, ya know? <1> That is true! I bet it is taking a lot of time, but accomplishing that would be entirely worth it.  <0> So true. It's just too bad I couldn't take my dogs with me, right? Ha! <1> haha definitely not! That would be way too dangerous. So what else are you into? <0> I enjoy a nice classic movie every now and again. Matter of fact, I watched Gone With The Wind recently and it always makes me cry. <1> Oh okay! I've always heard about it, but unfortunately have never watched it. I love movies in general though.  <0> It's a real tear jerker and it was controversial at the time because they used the "D" word in it.
<0> it's hard to believe the entire population of Iceland is under 400,000 <1> Yes, I think the reason is the temperature, but it is warmed by the Gulf stream <0> I love the cold weather, would move there in a heartbeat. <1> Oh, not me. I'd much rather live in a warmer climate, but it would be nice to visit once. <0> I wonder if there is n ice bar there? <1> There's gotta be. Gotta have a nice place to stay warm at drink at.  <0> Where would you live, if you could up and move? <1> South. Way south. Somewhere where is warm all the time, preferably by a beach. <0> That sounds nice, never been able to enjoy the salt life, really prefer doom and gloom.  <1> You sound like you'd be fun at parties lol. <0> Right! That's another reason I would love Iceland, less people. <1> That's nice, I would love Iceland too.
<0> I wish I owned a Ferrari, it would be so neat to drive around in that Italian sports car besed in Maranello <1> Yes! I have never owned a Ferrari, they are expensive! I would love a red one though. <0> They were rated the most powerful brand by Brand Finance in 2014 it would be awesome to drive such a powerful car <1> Wow! Yes I usually associate the brand with powerful people. I wonder how many car models the Ferrari brand has. <0> I am not sure, but I do know that the 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO became the most expensive car ever! too bad I couldn't afford it lol. <1> Wow! Yes I bet the 1962 model was expensive then and even more now! I bet it had a high horsepower.
<0> Well sure we are here to procreate and that takes two and raising a family is a teamwork kind of thing <1> Right, yeah. But what also blew my mind when reading up about the cultural aspect of marriage is the fact that child marriage, polygamy, and forced marriages still exist in today's day and age. They're all cultural traditions that are celebrated and enforced. <0> I'm actually not legally married to my husband (though I call him that). We are common-law partners.  Doesn't bother me but I'm sure it would bug some people. <1> I haven't managed to find anyone yet, but I think as long as your in love, your legal status doesn't matter <0> Agreed.  For us, marriage just seemed like a waste of money--you can do a lot more exciting things with that amount! <1> Yes, you can! What do you guys like to do together? <0> We play video games, watch movies. He's a lot more athletic than I am, but I try to join him on hikes when I can. <1> That sounds like a good way to have fun and get some exercise! I'm rather lazy myself, I just like to sleep in.  <0> Oh, me too!  I'm a night owl and I hate getting up early in the morning. <1> Mornings are the worse! I've been trying to find a night job so I can sleep all day.

<0> My roommate recently moved out of my house so now it is just me and my dog.  My dog is really nice and doesn't really bark unless he sees a stranger coming up to the house.  Lately he has been sitting at the top of the steps to the basement and growls/barks.  However,  there are no windows to the basement and he wouldnt be able to see into the basement.  I have no idea why he has been barking at that door lately. <1> wow that is a lot to take in.  get a muzzle
<0> Red the color at the end of the visible light spectrum looks good on everyone. Don't you think? <1> I am more of a fan of green.  That would leave us only one primary color: Blue. <0> But the dominant wavelength of red is approximately 625–740. That's impressive! <1> Hey, i have seen many a red sunset, and the wavelength you have mentioned is the reason. <0> I'm sure those sunsets were brilliant yellow-tinged scarlet and vermillion. The most beautiful red. <1> Very beautiful indeed, some of the best sights to see!
<0> My husband threw away a very important document yesterday and I was so mad at himk. <1> Oh no! what was it and what will you do? <0> I make my Husband look for it because I really need that document  <1> oh no ! i'm so sorry . what was it ? <0> an important document <1> Can it be replicated by whomever sent it? Sometimes I misplace my bank statements, and I have to call the bank for an additional copy <0> My bank statements are paperless, its a important document not statements <1> I see. How has he done so far in finding it? <0> hes not doing good at all, I'm never find it at this point <1> I'm sure it will turn up soon!
<0> Is Karate an offensive or defensive art? <1> Not sure, but I do know that full contact karate comes in different formats <0> Wow what formats <1> Goju-ryu, which is a lot like jujistu. Vicious counter-strikes and almost dance-like defenses. Then there <0> I like dancing and karate. I was in karate when i was younger. How about you? <1> I actually got into it fairly late. I was more into track and rowing in high school. What kind of dancing do you do? <0> i like 2 step. Rowing how many people are on a team? <1> When I rowed in high school, it was eight people to a boat. Not sure if college or other levels are different <0> I have seen it on TV before. It looks like a lot of work. Do you like the karate class you started? <1> Love it. We operate through a local group that provides leadership training for city kids. The kids have such drive and focus, it's great to see their skills develop <0> working with kids is so much fun. It is grate you are helping them develop skills. Do you help out in other local groups? <1> Yeah, I work my city's community garden group to support urban permaculture -- basically, parks full of free food. How about you? What's your jam?
<0> I like baking, it is my favorite hobby. <1> Me too! Bread is baked the most, and I like to make yeast bread. <0> I haven't made my own bread, it seems like it is a lot of work to do. <1> I used to think I would like to become a baker as my profession, because I really liked it. But, I never pursued it. <0> I work in a restaurant but as a dishwasher. The cook makes a lot of different breads and they smell wonderful.
<0> Hi, I really enjoy baking. My favorite things to bake are cookies, brownies and cake. How about you? <1> I am not a baker but wish I could make the most common baked item that I believe is bread. <0> I've never baked bread,but would like to try. That would be a very useful skill.  <1> I wouldn't imagine it is too difficult since bread is prepared from a dough of flour and water.   <0> You're right. I enjoy the sweet treats best though. I like the way they make my kitchen smell and watching others enjoy them.  <1> I bet your kitchen smells wonderful!  You could certainly call yourself a baker since you prepare all the yummy baked goods! <0> Oh yes, very much so. There isn't a day that goes by when I don't have something mixing or baking in the oven.  <1> It is very admirable that you bake so often.
<0> One time a person offered to drive me home when it was raining outside <1> He must be a good person bit if he's a stranger,  is it safe? <0> It was super creepy,  I did not take the offer ! <1> That is good safety first
<0> hello , how are you tonight . do you like horses ? <1> hi there , yes i love horses and so does barnaby my german shepherd . <0> that's a cute name . i have a lab named sirius <1> yeah , barnaby is a keeper and a great scorpion spotter . i hate scorpions . <0> i don't have them on the farm . i've seen them in the city though . <1> barnaby found one in my dad old nascar cars right before i sat down . <0> ugh . i do not think i could live with them . <1> only when we visit dad they come out . what do you do ? <0> i am in law school , but i also train horses <1> That must be so cool to work with horses.
<0> I get sad when I think about my parents. They have been gone for a few years now <1> Sorry to hear that what do you do to try and stay enlighten and happy when thinking of them? <0> I think of all the wonderful trips we used to take together. <1> That's nice to have those memories. Do they help a bit?
<0> Do you follow San-Diego Comic Con? <1> I know that it is held annually in the United States in California. My boyfriend is into the comic-con stuff. <0> Oh cool, I usually follow it every year to see the movie trailers and stuff that come out of it. <1> It's crazy that the event lasts for 4 days every summer since 2003. That is a lot of content and fun it seems like! <0> Yeah a lot of people put a lot of work into their costumes. It is pretty cool.\ <1> I was interested to find out that on the Wednesday prior to the official opening, guests for all 4 days can attend a "Preview Night" and walk the exhibit hall before the convention begins. How cool! <0> That is really interesting, I wonder if everything is already set up. <1> I don't care how their costumes are, Let's see on the Preview Night.
<0> Small thing in life used to make me shed tears. <1> Indeed they can. Is there any specific moment that you would like to talk about? <0> Yes,  things like great classical music for example.  <1> Oh,  I see. I thought that some other bad things happening in your personal life are making you cry
<0> I feel angry i have to pay with an interest <1> Oh I hate that. Is it a high interest rate? <0> yes,  it is exorbitant just to say <1> It's highway robbery. Well I can only hope you can pay it quickly to avoid as much of that as possible. <0> i hate it. I'm afraid i can't pay it quickly and it will be too much for me.
<0> I love rap music. I'm a fan of Snoop Dogg. <1> Yeah, he is a popular rapper, songwriter, Television personality, and actor. I like him too. <0> I didn't know he was an actor. What kind of acting has Snoop Dogg done?  <1> He was the voice in the movie Turbo. <0> I actually didn't see that movie. Is that about a car or something?  <1> It's a Dreamworks Animation in 2013 as the voice of Smoove Move the snail, lol. <0> That sounds a cute character. I like dreamworks animation movies. What is that one popular one they made?  <1> I have no idea. What type of music do you like?
<0> You like jazz? I do, it's music that originated in the African American communities here in the US. <1> Yes, I love jazz music! It's very relaxing to me. Who is your favorite jazz musician? <0> I don't know many musicians by name, but I love it so much. It's seen as "America's classical music". <1> I can believe that! I'm a big fan of the sound of the brass instruments used in jazz music. Do you know what they are? <0> Not really, but I do know that jaxx has been around since the 1920s. <1> How interesting! Why do you think jazz has become so popular? 
<0> Have you ever tried a gluten free pasta?  <1> No, but my friend eats gluten free stuff. <0> Apparently if you're gluten free you can have many gluten triggered diseases <1> Yeah, she can't eat bread, eggs or milk. But she eats a lot of potatoes and rice. <0> My friend is not celiac but claims to have gluten sensitivity so she gets depressed if she eats gluten. I'm unsure if it's legitimate <1> Mine is celiac. It's supposed to be a pretty common thing. Unfortunately, she didn't find out what it was until she was 20 years old. <0> It's unfortunate, as it's an autoimmune disorder, and those are best managed as early as possible yet don't go diagnosed until people are in their twenties
<0> how are you ? my name is darlene and chinese is one of the languages i speak . <1> hi ! names betsy and bought our first home <0> congrats ! i love music and playing my guitar and violin . <1> i work as a teacher in a school . and also have 2 step kids <0> i'm single , no kids , but am really good at playing ping pong . <1> wow that's pretty nice . i recently moved to the us with my husband <0> wow that is cool , i live in a small town where everyone knows my electrician father . <1> that is pretty cool do you like it there ?
<0> two full sleeves of tatoos , got them done in la <1> i've almost a full body suit . . . mostly japanese influenced <0> What do you do for a living then? I work as a freight driver and find that loads of us have them..... <1> I sell insurance, so I get to work from home a lot. I am a homebody that likes to sit on the couch and watch TV. <0> Have your employers been accepting of your tats, when they do see you at an office ? 
<0> I was very ready going into my test <1> Always good to feel ready for something like that. What subject was it in? <0> Engingeering. It was really tough! <1> Man,  I remember those days. My engineering exams were killer. Did you do well on it? <0> I haven't gotten the results yet but I feel confident!
<0> I used to have bright red hair but as the years have gone by it has become more brown. <1> I had blonde hair that turns brown... I hate it so I dye it blonde. It is the 2nd most common hair color. <0> I don't bother dying mine. I think I'm starting to get a few grey hairs anyway. The brown/red balance is the least of my worries. <1> You must not be a female.. lol I mean brown varies from light to dark, but I prefer blonde <0> You guessed correctly! But I did once have hair down to my shoulders. Perfect little red ringlets. <1> I find it interesting that brown hair is thicker than blonde but red hair is even thicker. <0> It's true! My individual hairs are quite thin and silky, but the density of folicles on my scalp is 3 times that of other people. <1> Nice! Australian Aborigines and Melanesians are mainly brown too. <0> That's neat. I've heard that the aboriginal people of Japan, the Ainu, occasionally had red or blonde hair. Is that real or am I just crazy? <1> I think it is real! Some have bright red hair
<0> I love Mexico! What is your favorite part? <1> I like the part that closely borders the USA the most.  <0> Yeah? Did you know the capital city is the oldest capital in the Americas, and was first built by the Aztecs in 1325. <1> I didn't know that! Do you have any other facts about Mexico? <0> Of course! Mexico is the 11th most populated country in the world with around 117 million people. I'v travelled there quite a bit so picked up some things! <1> What is your favorite food from Mexico? <0> Definitely enchiladas. How about you? <1> I love them...but they give me gas! It's pretty bad.  <0> That isn't Ideal, but my mother makes ones so good it'd be worth it! <1> Enchiladas for the win! Gas never hurts anyone. Sometimes I even use my armpits to make fart noises. I can play the National Anthem with my pits.  <0> That's Impressive! My musical talent expands to playing the triangle, It's harder than it looks to be honest. <1> I can not wait for you to entertain me.
<0> So I'm on a serious diet with exercise to combat my obesity. I currently weigh 300 lbs. <1> Tell me about your diet? <0> I'm using the Paleolithic diet (which is also known as the caveman diet).  Very lean and clean. <1> So I'm guessing mostly fish and chicken, what are the benefits of this diet? <0> It uses foods presumed to have only been available during the stone-age. Meat and vegetable, berries, etc. <1> I guess that makes it healthier, do you like the diet, did you try any others? <0> I like this one. I have tried vegetarianism because I am Indian, but felt like my body really needed meat! <1> Lol I like meat too, but I wouldn't mind vegetarianism. You have any dieting tips?
<0> i run a lot , my wife cut out of me . it is cool . <1> i like the new colorful trends in running clothes <0> I think my favorite path to run is through central park what about you? <1> I love it there, it is so calming and peaceful. Except when you end up stuck in traffic in Pigeon Forge. haha <0> Oh wow that seems like a very long run.. from NYC to TN <1> haha. I was referring to the gang of pigeon's in NY. <0> Oh I understand now! Yeah, but they are better than the geese <1> they can be a turn off for running in the parks, and make me consider running on the treadmill, but love the action of outdoors. <0> I do too it just isn't the same on the treadmill. You cant replace the feeling of the cool crisp NY air <1> Yeah, running in outdoors is more satisfying to me. So colorful. Fuels an artist's imagination. <0> Ahh so you are an artist! WHat is your preferred method of crafting? <1> a teacher, but I dabble on my own time, of course, on the canvas.
<0> Even when life is tough and seems very unfair I have done my best to care for my family. <1> Thats great of you. Life is VERY unfair but we can go at any minute,  so cherish those you love!
<0> My emu ran away last night. I was quite distraught. <1> Not sure what an emu is. I hope you find him/her! <0> It is similar to an Ostrich! <1> Oh, wow, they're big then. Any leads yet? <0> Unfortunately not. Have you ever lost a pet? <1> When I was a kid, my dog went missing for two days. Thank God someone called and found her.  <0> I hope that is the case for me! I love this Emu so much, I even have a tattoo of her on my arm! <1> Please have faith. Someone is bound to see her. Annie is a cute name.  <0> Thanks! I appreciate the support! <1> Anytime, I mean people like us who love our pets know how hard it is when they're missing. Did you call the police?
<0> The vacations I used to take when I was younger with my family have been on mind lately. <1> Are the good memories at least?
<0> My local animal shelter donated a dog to me because of my service connected disability. It was such a nice surprise  <1> That's nice. How  do you like the dog? <0> He is my best friend and I think he needs me as much as I need him. <1> That is so sweet. My apartments don't allow pets <0> I am lucky. I can have pets where I live. 
<0> I love exercising, it really gets me into a state of health and well-being. Do you exercise <1> Me too, I think excersising is the best. I like to run on the treadmill. What kinda workouts do you do?  <0> Nothing beats going outside for a jog, getting that good sunlight and fresh air. But physical fitness isn't achieved through exercise alone,  fitness is generally achieved through proper nutrition. Do you eat healthily? <1> I do eat healthy, I try and drink a fruit smoothie every morning and in the evening I drink a protein shake. Do you think protein shakes are good for workouts?  <0> Oh defineatly, getting enough protein in your diet is essential to good muscle health and the bodies ability to function efficiently and effectively  <1> Indeed, I hear it helps build up your muscles too. What type of workouts would you recommend for some serious weight loss? Ive been wanting to up my game lately.  <0> For weight loss, anything that gets the heart rate up works. You don't need to build muscle to lose weight, simple jumping jacks or high knees will suffice and also helps your body to resist hypokinetic diseases <1> Oh ok thanks for the tips, Ill have to try some of those. I am a pretty big guy so I guess ill have to start light and then work my way up. What about dietary supplements, Any you would recommend?  <0> Personally, I just take a multi-vitamin, usually they include vitamins, minerals, fiber, fatty acids, or amino acids. But you don't really need these as long as you have a good diet with lots of variety!
<0> what happened with your mom ? i use to write for the paper . <1> she left us when we were young <0> sorry to hear that. well if you ever need to talk about it, you know where my condo is bud. <1> Thanks, I really appreciate that.

Have you ever done it? <1> I have not , but I do want to try. I have seen where you can have someone come teach you how to make it.  <0> That sounds like a great idea, I'd have to work it around my schedule (I'm a student). <1> oh , what are you studying to be ? I'm currently a Paramedic. <0> I'm studying social sciences :) <1> what do you like about social science?

<0> I don't understand why people with gray hair try to cover it up with coloring <1> I agree, there is nothing wrong with gray or speckled hair. Perhaps it is because many celebrities do it as well. <0> Even more odd is the granny hair trend where young women are coloring their hair different shades of gray. <1> Perhaps if more young women did that then the older women would stop dying their hair! Funny how fads come and go so quickly. <0> Yes.  They say the trend is attributed to fasion designer Jean-Paul Gaultier's  2011 fashion show <1> The strangest hair trend to me is the mullet. I have seen quite a few men sporting them recently. <0> I love "cool hand luke" where they refer to defeated villians as mullet heads.
<0> hi there , how are you <1> i'm good . how are you ? <0> i am pretty good . tell me about yourself ? <1> well , i love shopping and pampering myself . i go to the spa a lot ! <0> Same, i love self care, I think necessary to recharge and feel relaxed after a week of work, a spa is always a good choice.
<0> that sounds lame . listening to rap music always chills me out . <1> my favorite music is jacob sartorius <0> What genre is that? <1> Pop music. What do you like to do in your free time?  <0> I like to play on the computer and listen to rap.  What do you do? <1> I like cloud watching. Laying on the grass and just relaxing.  <0> That sounds great!  Do you pick out animal shapes in the clouds? <1> Sometimes. Objects other times. I like doing it at the park. Meet lots of nice people.  <0> That sounds really nice.  Maybe I ought to get out of my special chair and spend more time outside.  <1> It is nice. I prefer meeting people outside rather than a bar or club.  <0> At least you get to see them better outside! ha ha <1> Thats funny! Very true! <0> Do you have a favorite park?
<0> I didn't know that every letter gets used in a crossword! That's cool. How often do you do crossword puzzles? <1> I try and do at least one a week. The cryptic crosswords have each clue as a word puzzle in and of itself so it can take a while to solve them. <0> My dad loved cryptic crosswords!  I remember finding them way too hard when I was younger--maybe I should try them again, <1> Definitely! You'll get addicted. It's like a workout for your brain! <0> I'll check them out.  I'd rather do those than anything math related, that's for sure! <1> I can't argue with that! I was never a huge fan of math. <0> I really hated math when I was in school--English was always my favorite. <1> My favorite class in school was always art. I love painting, drawing, and I would even crochet during my other classes. <0> That's awesome! Hey, speaking of painting, did you know it's Bob Ross' birthday today?  <1> It is? I do know that today is mathematician Isaac Newton's birthday, though.
<0> I really like the color red. I find it beautiful. <1> the color red has a wavelength of approx. 625-740 nanometres <0> Is red one of the primary colors? <1> It is at the end of the spectrum light. it sits next to orange and is opposite of violet. <0> oh okay. What else can you tell me about the color red? <1> the red color in blood actually comes from something called hemoglobin <0> I remember that word from school. I forgot about that. <1> i also read that red is one of the first colors used in prehistoric art

He saw a man get mugged and drove his taxi into the entrance of an alleyway to block the thief's escape. He was ok though. <0> wow, did they catch the guy? <1> They sure did. My father got an interview with a local news channel and my sister and I got to be there too. <0> That must be great footage to pull out at family gatherings. <1> Yeah we were all very proud of him. We take him out to celebrate the event every year with dinner and a movie. <0> That's awesome. Sounds like a great family.
<0> So we finally found the perfect Rotty breeder and we got to pick up our puppy this week! <1> Oh boy that is great news! I hope you didn't drop a pretty penny on it! Haha,  and even if you did,  dogs are worth it. <0> No he was the runt so we got him on the cheap side!  He is sooooo sweet!  I am so happy <1> Hey runts are the best! They need love too. Either way,  I'm glad you were paired up with the perfect companion. <0> Me too, i can't wait to snuggle him at night.
<0> My husband cooked me my favorite food today! He never cooks! <1> that is awesome. what did he make you? <0> Bacon egg and cheese on toast! It was amazing! He makes the best fried eggs. <1> that sounds yummy. i'm glad you had that special treat. <0> It was yummy! I hope i get it again sometime soon
<0> yeah it is quite tedious work <1> yeah i remember working for a call center job and it was stressful at times <0> I used to work at a call center in Baltimore, it was a nightmare! <1> I'm from Baltimore! I loved driving in the Appalachians with my wife. <0> Ah, the Appalachians are gorgeous!  Just like my mustache! <1> Weird thing to say. Did you want to discuss your facial hair? <0> Not particularly, I just caught a glimpse of Slick Daddy in the mirror and had to mention how good he looks. <1> Do you have, like, a relationship with your mustache? <0> I suppose one could call it that. <1> Do you have relationships with your eyebrows?
<0> Hi friend, something terrible just happened to me! <1> Oh, I'm so sorry! Do you want to talk about it? <0> No!, want to talk about positive things <1> lets talk about our favorite color. mine is blue <0> Wow great! its a traditional and non-threatening color, i like yellow <1> why do you like the color yellow?

<0> I once swam with manta rays. They are beautiful creatures. <1> Manta rays are very beautiful! They are typically found in warmer subtropical waters. <0> What do manta rays eat? <1> They are actually filter feeders, so they feed on zooplankton. <0> Are manta rays at risk of being endangered? <1> I'm not sure if they are at risk, but they are definitely protected by the Convention of Migratory Species of Wild Animals. <0> That's good to know. How do they reproduce? <1> Same way as everything else. I'm thinking of going to this zoo that lets people swim with the rays. Would you recommend it?
<0> good evening . how are you ? <1> enjoying a nice evening watching television cooking shows <0> i am watching the season finale of fear the walking dead . <1> hummus is one of my favorite foods as a vegan <0> i ate hummus when i was younger . i was born in 1984 . <1> do you like rollercoasters or sky diving ? i love them it is exciting . <0> i use to . roller coasters give me vertigo now . <1> i also like to float in the pool because i'm a bad swimmer . <0> i listen to a lot of classic hip hop . <1> i listen to country music <0> I like some country as well!  Who is your favorite country singer?
<0> i got home from work today and found someone stole my tv <1> oh wow.. that stinks <0> the police dept could not help me fine out what happened. <1> When things like this happen I find it helpful to remember how insignificant we are in the big scheme of things. <0> But I need to feel that my home is safe and I can feel secure. <1> You should think about getting a security system. I got one after my moms house was broken into. <0> Its  like the meat that I eat I have to know that it is safe. <1> I understand. We all have a need to feel safe in our homes. Hopefully, the police will catch the thief.

It is training for developing size and strength of skeletal muscles! <0> I don't want to get too bulky.
<0> I do not have much energy <1> Are you having trouble carrying out normal daily routines?  Could be chronic fatigue syndrome. <0> I am thinking so, maybe i need to see a doctor on this <1> It isn't something that can be cured, but chronic fatigue syndrome can be managed. <0> How can i manage it <1> Either use cognitive behavioral therapy, or start exercising more.  Or both. <0> i will try and do both. But what is the cause of this
<0> I was glad when my friend paid me back money he owed me. <1> I'm glad you got your money back. <0> yeah, thanks for sending it to me. <1> No problem! I'm just glad to help. Do you loan money often? <0> Occasionally, I enjoy helping people out. How is your morning going? <1> It's busy, but I enjoy the rush. It keeps things interesting. How about yours? <0> It is going good. I am getting ready for my morning run. Do you enjoy exercising?  <1> I don't really enjoy it, but I do it for my health since I do enjoy being alive, haha. <0> Haha, I understand that. I mostly do it for stress relief.
<0> A mommy deer got hit by a car in front of my house and her two babies keep hanging around looking for her. I'm afraid they're going to go in the road like she did and get killed. Ugh. <1> That is so sad, humans made a huge impact on animals lives in that sense <0> I agree, I wish people would take more care <1> I wish there was more I could do for the wild life. <0> yeah me too, I need to start eat less fish, that will help <1> It isn't healthy to eat fish more than once a week. Too much MSG. <0> then it'll be good for me too <1> Yeah, I've been trying to recycle more and use eco friendly products.    <0> Think everyone needs to make a huge effort for the environment <1> I agree. I try and do what I can. I encourage my kids too.  
<0> hello ! i finally turned 18 ! <1> cool do you like pro wrestling or not . <0> i used to watch it with my boyfriend all the time , but we broke up . <1> well that is to bad , i am a wrestler my self ! <0> that's neat ! i like old hogan because his uniform is my favorite color . . . orange ! <1> cool i like him to . that's why i workout all the time ! <0> i've a fish that is orange and i named him hogan too ! <1> speaking of fish i made some yesterday . while volunteering at the homeless shelter . <0> no kidding ? i actually work at a shelter in seattle . do you hike <1> no ! but i'd like too do so one day . <0> i hike before work in the morning . the morning sun is the best . <1> you hike before you go to work ? where do you live ?
<0> That is interesting.  What turned you to eating vegan? I love a good melt in your mouth steak. <1> I just wanted to be healthier, so I started with veganism which is the practice of abstaining from animal products. <0> Well, actually my husband wanted me to eat healthier, even though I think steak is healthy. <1> We eat steak at least once a week, but I know it isn't necessarily healthy. <0> It is filled with protein, so I believe it is good for you if you eat it once a week.  <1> Yes, but I know a vegetarian diet is so much better, the problem I would have is I don't like vegetables. <0> I love vegetables, they are great in salads or eaten as a side dish.  <1> I like salads, which is probably the only vegetables I really like.  But, I think the protein from meat is important too. <0> Yes, protein is very important for your health, and for building lean body mass.  <1> I live in the south where everything is fried!  At least I do grill almost all the meat I eat, including the steak.   <0> Fried food is not good for you. Grilling is a good way to go when cooking meat. Beans and yogurt are also a good source of protein. <1> So maybe I should just stick to my steaks haha! Thanks for the advice. 
<0> I was always so afraid to go to sleep when I was a little kid...Always thought there were spooky monsters under the bed. <1> I think some kids go through that. Did your parents comfort you? <0> They didn't, unfortunately. We don't get along these days. <1> Hey how are you <0> I think I'm okay. I haven't come out to my parents yet, I don't think they would accept it. <1> i'm sorry to hear . what happened to your parents ? <0> They are homophobic but I can't tell them. I prefer to be alone and draw.
<0> I just dyed my hair light purple. I am really excited about it! <1> That sounds amazing!  Hair color can be done by a hairdresser or at home, how did you do yours? <0> I went to a hairdresser to have it done. <1> I wish I could see it!  Hair dying has a long history.  In ancient Greece the Celtic people dyed their hair blonde. <0> That's really cool! How did they manage that? <1> They bleached it by washing it in lime and combing it back!  Crazy to think of that happening so long ago. <0> I guess people have always wanted to try different things. That is super interesting! <1> Yeah! I've always wanted to get my hair dyed too.
<0> i'm very wealthy . i live on a private island and go diving alot <1> oh , cool ! do you have any hobbies ? i like to knit <0> ya ok buddy.. <1> sure, do you have any hobbies? <0> I pick through my neighbors garbage so that I don't starve to death.

Would'nt mind make a trip in that case <0> i dont have any idea.  <1> Well, it's a pretty big one and it's got an Aquarium, so even if it doesn't have any Manta Ray's, at least I'm bound to see something cool  <0> yeah im sure they have other animals you might like there <1> Have you ever seen a Ray in person? I hear diving with them at night is a real spectacle. <0> Yes, I saw some in Atlanta.

<0> I had a flat on the way to work this morning,  and the jack handle was missing from my car. <1> Oh no. What did you do? <0> I used a screwdriver to work the jack. It sucked,  lol. <1> Lol,  well done for attempting it. Did you make it to work on time? <0> Nope, I was about an hour late thanks to that...
<0> I've really wanted a Ford Excursion for a long time. <1> Interesting,  those things are huge,  Do they even make them any more? <0> They haven't made them for quite a few years.  But I met a guy that just picked one up in the last few days! <1> Do you have a large family,  or do you just like the idea of a large SUV? <0> We don't have a huge family,  just 5.

What do you do for work if you don't mind my asking. <0> im in healthcare i work in a pharmacy <1> Healthcare is always a great field. My mom is a nurse and loves it so much she's not sure she will ever retire. <0> it definately has good job security especially nurses <1> Yeah for sure, and it pays well also. Our jobs are similar in that we get to help people and do a service for a living.
<0> I am waiting to find out if I really won the lottery. <1> Me too! I bought about a thousand dollars worth of tickets last night! <0> Wow. I spent $500.00 myself. I hope it pays off! <1> You and I both! No matter who wins,  let's promise to split the pot.

That sounds like a rewarding career.  I love animals. <0> Me too! LOL! I have a pet dog, and she inspires me everyday. I can't wait to work with all types of animals. Do you have a pet? <1> Yes, I have a dog.  He's a rescue and the best dog ever, in my opinion. LOL   <0> I totally agree with having a rescue dog, or pet, they deserve loving homes. I personally not attracted to pure bred dogs, to many potentials for birth defects. <1> Yes, I agree.  I hear that a lot.  It seems like they know they were rescued and are now very much loved. <0> I really think rescued animals, actually rescue us more.  <1> Yes, I absolutely agree.   <0> But i do not have any dogs of my own do you?

You can have it with pesto sauce, tomato sauce, or just a little olive oil. <1> True.  Pasta has influenced cuisines in the United States. <0> It has. I prefer homemade pasta.

They are pricey but last a long time. <1> i bet you can make nice things from their wool,it could give some fittings <0> It would probably be cheaper to make it yourself too. <1> Yeah I didn't think about that,its good you suggested that, Could see some benefit there.. <0> Do you own any wool items? <1> yeah, i do own some

Maybe she will understand if you just can't make it. <0> I wish I didn't have to work on that day.
<0> Hello, have you colored your hair before? It is practice of changing the hair color <1> Yes, I have. I have done so for many years. <0> I don't know what your reasons must have been. Anyways,   a primary reason is to cover gray or white hair, to change to a color regarded as more fashionable or desirable <1> Yes, that is why I do it now. I have some grays that I cover to blend with the rest of my hair. Do you color your hair? <0> Of course, I have some white hair as well, I usually do it at home with the help of my loving wife and sometimes through the services of a professional at a salon  <1> I prefer to use a professional. Do you have any advice about hair coloring? <0> Oh well, there is no big deal about doing this. About  $1.9 billion was spent for this alone  in 2011 in  USA <1> Wow, that is incredible. People really like to color their hair. It is mostly women, I suppose, but also growing in popularity with men? <0> Yes, it's also growing in popularity with men who wish to color their white hairs.
<0> i prefer to be out in nature with my paintbrushes . trees are beautiful . <1> i really enjoy riding roller coasters outdoors ! it is one of my favorite things to do . <0> Roller coasters let you see the trees from a different perspective, when you are at the very top <1> So true! Plus you're able to see the world from a perspective you've never seen. You ever been to Disney World? <0> Only once, many years ago.  I was just a child. <1> My mother took me a lot as a kid. My dad left when I was only 5, so she took me there to get my mind off of it. <0> It's good to be able to lose yourself in an activity you love.  For me now, that is painting. <1> Agreed. I wish I was talented enough to paint. Do you ever paint any rollercoaster portraits? <0> No, I never have.  I can visualize one peeking out over the trees from a distance though.  Joins nature and civilization in a whimsical way. <1> I bet your portraits are amazing! I get as much of a thrill out of nature as I do rollercoasters. <0> I wish I lived near the mountains...so much more variety in nature. But I have learned to find the beauty of the plains. <1> You should look into Tennessee. The mountains there are majestic - plus they have plenty of amusement parks in the mountains for people like me.
<0> I bet that was interesting. I sure wish I had a pool for him to clean. I want to talk to him one day. <1> Just remember, pool boys are people too! They aren't just swimming pool furniture! <0> I will try to keep that in mind.  <1> Thank you for the advice. Next time, I'm gonna follow that <0> I really would like to have a pool for the hot summers though.  <1> Yes, me too. I just like to stay in the pool for a long time doing nothing <0> After working at the zoo all day it would be nice to come home and jump in the pool.  <1> If I have a pool, I would never get out if it  <0> Actually my wife works at the zoo with me, it would be great for both of us. <1> That's good, You're a one lucky person <0> I am very lucky, what do you do for work?
<0> I am really scared of Manta ray's since i say it killed the crocodile hunter <1> I want to learn more about them, I know they beach like whales, are they poisonous? <0> im not sure if they are poisonous but they have a big sharp dagger on their tailes <1> I know they are found in sub tropical and tropical waters and they look scary <0> Yes they do, one time i was in the ocean and saw one jumped like 20ft away from me i was so scared <1> They are listed as endangered by International Union for Conservation of Nature <0> that is so sad i dint know, i have the fact that there is so much plastic at the beach that is probably the reason <1> They are threatened by pollution, getting caught in fishnets and Chinese harvesting them for medicine <0> yeah that is why every time i head to the beach i try to gather as much trash as posible <1> If everyone did as much as you did, they would thrive more than they do now.
<0> I feel alone tonight! It's hard to put your foot down and give tough love. <1> What happened <0> My son was misbehaving at the store. <1> what was the kid doing ? <0> He wanted me to open some candy up, I was buying it for Halloween. <1> Im pretty sure I did the same thing to my parent. Did he calm down?  <0> He did after a while but not before the whole store was staring at me.  It's necessary but it's so hard to give tough love <1> I dont have any kids, just my cat Charlie. <0> I love cats but we live in an apartment temporarily, my husband doesn't want any pets right now.   <1> Must be nice to have a family. My favorite food is pizza but having a family to cook for would be nice <0> I love pizza too!
<0> I am relaxed right now ate a nice dinner now I am relaxing on the couch watching tv.  <1> That seems pleasant. I am currently in my chair working! <0> I am getting ready to go to bed I am in my pyjamas  <1> I need some good rest,  myself.

Do you regularly exercise? <1> I try to, I am actually dieting right now <0> I hope its going well for you. I actually hate running but I have to force myself if I want to stay healthy. <1> thanks, it's going pretty good. Yes, I walk on a treadmill, but I always feel good after <0> I'm married with kids so find it hard to go to the gym but I know what you mean about feel good afterwards. Are you married?
<0> I just had my birthday,  and my family and fiance did everything they could to make it special. I don't have much,  but I'm thankful to have them at least. <1> Happy Birthday! <0> Thank you! I hope your birthday,  whenever it is,  is awesome as well! <1> What all did they do for you? <0> They didn't do much. They only took me to the McDonald's and we had a great time there.

I only have one child but she's my whole world.
<0> When I was pregnant, the smell of cooking egss made me feel so sick <1> Really? Did you avoid eating them? <0> It was strange, I could eat them, but I couldn't be anywhere near them while they were cooking.  do you have any quirks like that? <1> I haven't had any problems with foods, but pollen has always bothered. <0> Had to go with hubby to work brunch, eggs cooking and I had to hide in bathroom. Have you ever had to stop because of pollen <1> I've never had to stop anything because of pollen, but allergy season is always tough. <0> Do you have to take medicine for it <1> I don't but I probably should. I just tough it out. <0> Where do you work?
<0> Oh I though it was older than that. Do you know if it is still running? <1> i am sure it is still running but not sure if they keep putting out episodes, Shonda Rhimes developed the pilot and continues to write for the series <0> I love her work, do you know what else she worked on? <1> I honestly can't remember right now (don't tell her I said that), but I know she worked on it for a long time. <0> She does great work! What'd she do before working on the pilot? <1> I believe she did The Princess Diaries 2, but im not sure thats exactly what she did before hand <0> My sister loves that movie! we used to watch it all the time when we were kids. <1> I haven't watched it. Is it on Netflix? <0> Not sure. I watched Princess Diaries 2 on Disney plus.
<0> I really broke down when I heard my mom was sick <1> I'm so sorry. You feel so helpless when someone you love is ill.
<0> i love pasta! <1> I can prepare pasta a different way for my gluten free friends using rice flour in place of wheat <0> oh wow i wish i could do that <1> Which way do you prepare your pasta for cooking, as most dried pasta are commercially produced <0> oh thats cool. i jusually just get some already packaged and ready to go <1> Fresh pasta is usually produced with machines, and turned by hand  <0> thats very interesting <1> You can also but pasta shaped like tiny dinosaurs.
<0> I have a friend who is struggling maintaining her sobriety. She says it's tough to achieve a life balance. <1> Struggling with addiction is so hard you're a good person for listening to her. Is it drugs or alcohol? <0> Thank you. It's alcohol. She spent some time in a treatment setting to get started on the path to sobriety, but now that she's out, she's having a tough time. <1> Let her know you'll be there for her during thoughts of relapse. Is she attending AA classes? I know those help a lot. <0> She isn't, but I'll definitely pass on the suggestion! She said the first physical effects of withdrawal were tough, but the second stage, PAWS, might be worse! <1> Can you tell me what PAWS means? Hopefully she has an AA sponsor! <0> PAWS stands for post acute withdrawal syndrome. During this stage recovering addicts usually experience emotional and psychological symptoms. It's due to their brain trying to regain normal function. 
<0> hey ! my name is coach jon . <1> what sport do you coach ? <0> i was a high school gym teacher and basket ball coach , i am retired now . a <1> i always liked basketball . i played d1 football instead though <0> eat lots of meat to stay built , i always say a cheeseburger a day <1> oh , have you ever tried coffee ? <0> of course ! but it doesn't go good with burgers . <1> you should definitely give more a try . i drink 5 cups a day <0> geez that's a lot of money , i count pennies , i grew up in the gutter . <1> grew up in the gutter ? why ? <0> i was dirt poor , went to a soup kitchen every day . now volunteer there . <1> now that's a success story

<0> I was only asleep for an hour last night and I jumped out of bed! There was this smacking noise on my window it freaked me out! <1> Yikes! did you figure out what it was? <0> No, but it was probably just a branch or something. It's getting windy.  <1> Bad weather inbound? <0> Yeah, it is supposed to get very cold and windy soon. Maybe some storms as well.  <1> It stays pretty warm where we are down south. Thank goodness too, I dont want my girlfriend trudging through the snow pregnant <0> Yeah I miss the warm weather of the South, I just recently moved to the West coast. That is great news! When are you guys expecting? <1> Well, we are trying our best to get pregnant, but we haven't been lucky yet.
<0> Recently there have been a few break ins. <1> Oh no! Did you property get broken into? Or your neighbor's property?
<0> I don't think my partner's been faithful to me lately. So I just took an HIV test. Waiting for the results has me so worried. <1> I can imagine that would be a painful waiting period. Why do you belive she is unfaithful? <0> I was an idiot and looked at her phone. I have trust issues and I was right.  <1> The good news is the chances of actually getting HIV is relatively low. You should not have to worry about it. <0> I hope you are right! I'm still freaked a bit though.  <1> I would be too. You should talk to her about the cheating and also make her understand how worried you are <0> I don't know what to say to her. She has a way of making it all about me. Like I shouldn't have looked at her phone. <1> Well trust is earned. she shouldnt give you reason to doubt her <0> I thought I was being paranoid. I don't trust easily. This just screwed me up more. I will try man. Thanks <1> regardless of what she says about you checking phone, fact remains you were right and she cheated. you deserve better

What are your other intrests?  <1> I like music, mainly rock and blues.  I am building a Cigar Box Guitar at the moment. <0> Very cool! I love music. Do you play the guitar? <1> I do, though not very well.  I like to improvise.  I'm better at coming up with my own tunes than playing something known. <0> Practice makes perfect. I couldnt even begin to try. I cant play any instruments but I love to sing. <1> I wish I could sing.  I try to write songs and it would be helpful to be able to sing what I write. <0> I like writing songs also and poetry. I recently started a novel. <1> Wow!  I used to think I would like writing a book, but as I get older it seems harder to string sentences together. <0> It's a lot of hard work but I love it.
<0> At the beginning of the year I missed a lot of work.  I was sick but I didnt feel like a team player at the time. <1> Aw Im sorry. Are you doing better now? <0> yeah I'm doing much better thanks.  I'll for sure be getting a flu shot next year! <1> That's a good idea. I haven't done that in years. I always feel like I barely dodge a bullet by not getting it. <0> I have been lucky in the past but I dont remember the last time I have felt that sick. I definitely dont want to go through that again. <1> I can certainly understand that! How have you been otherwise?
<0> i'm great . just got done at the gym for today . <1> i do not go to the gym , i do a lot of running though . <0> I go to the gym every day, but never go running. Does it help you stay healthy? <1> It certainly does! <0> I might try it out. Do you eat healthy as well?  <1> I think so, lot's of organic, but enjoy some treats too. you? <0> I cook most meals for myself, but admittedly could use more veggies! I want to live a healthy lifestyle  <1> it's not always easy. luckily, we've a lot of forest running trails. super relaxing all the green . <0> Nice, I'm also near the forest and the weather has been beautiful, kind of cold though. Is it warm where you are? <1> it's getting colder! but i'm from a nordic country, we love being outdoors in all weathers. <0> I need to learn to be like you haha <1> haha i spend long hours working an office job, just need to escape somehow!  <0> Oh yeah, are you in a big city?
<0> never, but I am Italian and obsessed with Italian food! Have you been? <1> I've never been to Italy. Have you had any other kind of Italian food here in the United States? <0> I am always looking for new places. <1> Yes I like to try out different spots to eat there is a new one in are town I have not got to eat there yet  <0> Does it have good reviews? <1> Yes and they seem to busy when ever I go past the place I can not think of the name of it right now it is a Italian Restaurant  <0> There are so many good Italian Restaurants.  <1> Some told me the place that I was  talking about was expensive  <0> I would bet. If it's authentic, it will always cost more. <1> Most places like that are. I like to get 5.00 pizzas sometimes to save some money  <0> Absolutely no problem with that. I do the same. <1> I think you can to them if you want more on them , most of the time it is good the way it is <0> I always like more cheese, but it's a minimal cost.
<0> I love Snoop Dogg, are you a fan of his music? <1> Snoop has made a better living off of smoking Marijuana than Cheech and Chong ever did.  They don't get the respect they deserve, they were far ahead of their time. <0> Haha, you are definitely right about that. I like his song Gin and Juice, have you heard of it? <1> can't remember.  i just remember the song from "nice dreams', the one where they drove the ice cream truck that went; "mama talking to me try to tell me how to live, she can't tell me nothin cause my head is like a sieve". <0> I'm not familiar with that song. When was the Nice Dreams album released, if it was an album? <1> their second feature film in 1981.  "My basketball caoch done kicked me off the team; for wearing high heeled sneakers, and actin like a queen".  
<0> I'm always surprised at how many people suffer from obesity in the US. It's so unhealthy to carry all that extra body fat! <1> I unfortunately suffer from obesity, it's tough. <0> A few cases of obesity are caused primarily by genes or some medications. <1> What about diet or lack of exercise? <0> Absolutely. The most common cause of obesity is a combination of excessive food intake and a lack of exercise. <1> What are some steps to battle obesity? <0> The best way to prevent or combat it is through a combination of social changes and personal choices like eating less and exercising more.
<0> Isn't it crazy that fitness used to refer to your ability to not get tired while doing normal activities? <1> Wow! I had no idea. Do you know when the current day meaning of fitness originated? <0> I think that it was in the 1950's, after World War II. <1> Neat! There has been a huge increase in fitness program popularity in the pst couple decades. <0> Yes there has.  Likely due to the correlation of fitness with attractiveness. <1> Yes! That correlation has been around my entire life. It seems like a natural happening. <0> I think that it's so desirable now because people attribute positive personality traits with attractive people.
<0> no just for fun i am not very good at it for a team <1> who do you play basketball with ? <0> My two best friends <1> That's cool! Do you play basketball frequently? <0> I do about 2 times a week <1> Thats awesome! <0> What do you do for fun? <1> I like to read
<0> I love Snoop Dogg, have you ever heard of him? <1> I sure have. I'm not incredibly familiar with his work as a singer/songwriter, but I really like Snoop Dogg's personality and business sense. <0> He's sure made a lot of money from his connection to marijuana. I really like his song Gin and Juice. <1> Was that on his debut album "Doggystyle?" <0> I'm not sure to be honest, it may have been. Urijah Faber used it as his walk out song for his MMA fights. <1> Urijah Faber.... That sounds familiar. Is he the mixed martial artist who used to wear dreadlocks? <0> Yes that's correct. He was also known as The California Kid, he was a very accomplished fighter in the UFC. <1> Gotcha. I really am not completely up to date witht he UFC or mixed martial arts in general. That being said, I do listen to Joe Rogan.
<0> When I was a kid I used to steal candy from the local 7/11 with my brother. We never got caught from the store but my parents found all the wrappers hiding in our room. <1> Hahah that is funny. Were your parents angry? <0> Yes,  they demanded to know where we got the money to buy all that candy. We lied and said it was from a birthday party at school. Haha <1> Haha did they believe it?
<0> i also volunteer at a humane center when i can <1> wow , you are busy . what do you do at the humane center ? <0> i will try to help people as much i can <1> That is a great thing to do and it is very rewarding.  <0> thank you. actually i love helping <1> Thats cool, its always good to help charities and raise money for them. <0> really great of you. you feel very good in doing like that <1> I agree, I recently helped at my local boys and girls club <0> really appreciable. have u done like this in the past?
<0> Yesterday was my first time at a karaoke bar. I started to get all tense when my friends kept telling my I should go on stage to perform. <1> I feel you! I don't like to perform in front of people either. Did you decline?
<0> I always feel nervous in a crowd. <1> That's not good. Do you find yourself in that situation frequently? <0> Yes I do I have to fix it somehow. <1> i am a teacher so I am always in a crowded classroom <0> Maybe I can sit in to get over my fear <1> I thin kyou can do it! Just try and mentally prepare <0> That's easier said than done <1> Maybe its just a matter of energy, I like coffee to get me ready for situations <0> I'm a daily coffee drinker.i need a stronger drunk! <1> I also drink coffee every day, what do you do for work <0> I'm  a librarian.
<0> i like that but i've to work at grocery store to support me . <1> you should do yoga to relax <0> I'm working at a grocey store right now, but I want to be an actress, so I go to auditions every day after work. <1> That sounds like it would be an exciting job or hobby! <0> Yes, it is. I got a commercial for a local amusement park last week and it was a blast! It was my first official gig too.  <1> You must be very talented, any other auditions coming up? <0> Oh, I audition for everything in my area. My next one is for a dead body in an episode of Law and Order. <1> I love that show.  That would be an awesome part to play, good luck! <0> Thank you very much! What do you do for a living? Are you a yoga instructor? <1> No, I work at a hospital but I try to do Yoga a few days a week. It is very realxing <0> I do some yoga myself. It helps me stay flexible for my martial arts. <1> Martial Arts! You really are a jack of all trades. <0> yes of course i love martial art.
<0> I work as a clown as part of comic performers for my festival. <1> really? How fun! How long have you been doing that? <0> I have been doing it as an entertainment style for 15 years now.  <1> that's awesome! So do you use a specific make up and clothes? <0> Yes I do, modern clowns like me are strongly encouraged to use fancy clothes and make up to become more colorful. <1> honestly, i'm a little bit scared of clowns. i think it's because of the movie IT by Stephen King <0> Ha! Many circus clowns have become well known as creepy monsters that lurk in gutter drains because of that movie <1> yes, it's just so scary. i think that movie was the scariest i've ever seen <0> Scream is a 1996 American slasher film which you might enjoy I think. Its even more scary. <1> Yeah I don't think I could even sit through that, I don't think I could sit through one of your clown performances either.
<0> in the army here , i live in canada <1> oh , i walk a couple miles a day so i know the pain . <0> oh , my favorite food is shawarma <1> oh , i love spending time with my family . <0> my grandfather was in world world 2 <1> That's pretty cool!
<0> When I was a kid,  I remember telling my mom to take me to McDonald's,  just so I could get the toy in my Happy Meal. I didn't even care about the food. <1> Ha,  I used to do that too. But I was almost always disappointed by the toy once I actually got it. <0> Right? but when you collected them all there was no greater feeling. <1> True!

Unfortunately there are too many bad parents out there <0> i agree many parents do not have enough dicipline for their children <1> I never know who should discipline more, the parents or the school system.

<0> Red is one of my favorite colors. Its at the end of the visible spectrum. <1> It's never been one I've gravitated towards. But I'm open to learning more about all colors.

Have you ever seen it in person before? <1> Have you ever been to Niagra Falls, either the Canadian side, or the American side? <0> No, I have a friend that lives nearby though that I've been meaning to visit. He just said that it is really breathtaking. <1> I live in Buffalo, so it is very close by, and I have hiked the Niagara Gorge, and seen all the falls. <0> Yes, my friend has done the Niagara tour many times. The America Falls look so huge! <1> There are three falls, and the Horseshoe Falls is the biggest.  For the best views you should visit both sides of the river. <0> Have you actually been on the Skylon Tower? That would be a cool way to overlook the whole area. <1> oh really
<0> Almost all of the people in my family have brown hair. Although some have a varied shade of brown. <1> I have brown hair, but it was actually pretty blond when I was small. <0> It is interesting that eumelanin and pheomalanin are the two types of melanin that decide the hair color. <1> I wonder how the melanin changes- like hair gets lighter after time in the sun. <0> I believe it is due to the fact that melanin changes over time as a result the color can change slightly over time as well <1> Why does some people's hair change to gray but others change to pure white? <0> Again, that would be the change over time of the melanin at different levels of change. Complete lack of melanin will result in white hair and slight level of melanin will result in gray hair. <1> I wonder how my hair will look as I age
<0> Oh man. I can't believe I made that mistake at work today. <1> Uh OH what happened <0> I was giving a presentation on the project that I'm working on,  and I overlooked something simple.... one of my coworkers called me out on it.

But you can still eat it, it's all about portion control. <1> Yep, healthy eating is crucial. An unhealthy diet can cause diseases such as blindness, anemia, or health-threatening conditions.   <0> Yes. My dad passed away from diabetic complications.

Good nutrition promotes biological development and elongate length of life. <0> Yes it does. We never fry anything and mostly eat healthy.

<0> italian food is too spicy and chewy . <1> i love noodles and cheese and bread lol <0> Thats a strange combination, not all together I hope ?

Most of this is obvious so far, no offense. I'm looking for something juicy, because I watch a lot of Youtube videos, so the behind-the-scenes sounds interesting. What do you really get into? <0> I guess nothing about Youtube is surprising nowadays since its so commonplace. You probably already know about  video blogging, short original videos, and educational videos on it? <1> Honestly I dont really care much about youtube becuase it is quite boring
<0> My favorite color in the whole world is red. It's the color at the end of the visible spectrum of light. <1> It red a primary or a secondary color? <0> It is a primary color in the RGB color model, and it's also in the CMYK color model. It complements cyan.  <1> Do you know what the color is known to represent? <0> Well the Ancient Egyptians and Mayans were known to color their faces red for ceremonies, and Roman general would color their bodies when they were victorious.  <1> I wonder how the use of the color has evolved over the years.

They can reflect how you are feeling and are art! <0> Exactly, I'm glad someone else understands! <1> It is a good way to put your emotions into your artwork  <0> I agree! I feel like recycling is also a great trait! <1> I agree too! And you can to some great art while recycling. Art has really helped me as I am struggling with my marriage. <0> Yes, art is the best.

Had it on my summer trip to Italy as well. <0> Ah pasta and not noodles, ok, made differently of course. Where in Italy did you go ? <1> I went to Rome. Food was fantastic everywhere. Trip really improved my well being after working at my job for so long <0> I've been to Rome! You can walk all day there and see so many architectural delights.

<0> I can't believe the bottom of the bag ripped and my wonderful taco's covered the ground. I'm sure my face was bright red with anger. <1> NOT THE TACOS!!!! Seriously,  I can understand how frustrating that is. Especially when you have the taste for something.....then gone! <0> It's not like I could back in. I waited in line 20 minutes and had been looking forward to them all day. I had to skip lunch due to work being busy. I'm still mad. <1> Even worse. I'm so sorry. What did you do instead? <0> A bowl of dry cereal.  <1> Laughing *and* crying for you! Next time!
<0> Have you ever colored your hair? Hair coloring, or hair dyeing, is the practice of changing the hair color :) <1> I see. No i have not. But i will like to know the process involved  <0> OK, well..  Hair coloring can be done professionally by a hairdresser or independently at home; most of the time it's done at home to save money <1> I see. When did this start and where did it originate <0> I'm unsure of the history but I think it dates back to anicent roman/greece  <1> Hmmm. Have you ever done it before? <0> Yes I have a few times... hair coloring is very popular, with 75% of women and 18% of men living in Copenhagen having reported using hair dye according to a study by the University of Copenhagen. <1> I see. Is there any psychological effect of hair dye?  <0> I don't know
<0> I'm thinking of making a key lime pie today. I love baking!  <1> Me too. A baker bakes and often sells breads using an oven or other heated device. <0> I'm just a humble home baker. I make things just for my family and friends to enjoy.  <1> Grains have been popular for a thousand or more years, so baking is a very old practice. <0> I never stopped to think about it! I guess they would have baked over open fire.  <1> By the sixth century AD, the Greeks would use ovens heated by wood fires and communities baked in a big ol' communal oven.
<0> Hi! I love anything that is pasta. <1> Hmmmm sounds yummy. DO you know any good recipe for pasta <0> If you are allergic or prefer gluten free, then you can make pasta with rice flour. <1> I will love to make those. My cousin has told me a lot about pasta <0> Pasta originated from Sicily in 1154? <1> Wow. You must really be a fan of pasta to have known where it originated from
<0> i love country music and it was such a shock , he was only 50 <1> i love country music too . but hey this stuff happens <0> Yeah, at-least his music will still be around for us to listen!  <1> true, true. the great legends never really die! do you like old country mostly or the newer stuff? <0> I like the older stuff, Charlie Daniels is one of my favourite artists. What about yourself ? <1> I love the old, sad country music, Merle Haggard, Waylon Jennings. I'm not up on current music though. I usually listen to podcasts or audiobooks in the car  <0> What audio books are you listening to at the moment?  <1> I just finished Education: A Memoir and trying to decide what to listen to next. Do you like audiobooks? <0> I haven't really tried listening to any. Call me old school but I like having the physical book in hand. Maybe look up something to do with country music?  <1> Lots of people do prefer hardcopy bound books, nothing wrong with that. I dislike driving, so it's a good safe distraction for me to have something to listen to <0> t is a safe distraction alright! I'm 23 and still haven't got my license yet. It gets pretty hard getting around in Tennessee.  <1> You should get your license
<0> I am a computer programmer. I do not have a degree in it, though. <1> I'm studying to be a programmer and computer engineer myself. <0> That's awesome. I have two degrees in environmental engineering, but I love programming! <1> Oh cool! I want to get better at programming and software engineering since I'm not great yet. <0> You will get there! It takes years to master a subject and a craft. <1> Are you more of an engineer in your career than a computer programmer? <0> My job requires a bit of both. I have to use programmable logic controllers and software integrated with engineered devices.
<0> Are fat people funiier? Maybe. what do you think? <1> I am not too familiar with the fat acceptance movement. Obesity is terrible for your health, so why accept it? <0> Why not accept it? Is it any of your business if someone is fat or not? Does it affect you, really? <1> I am obese myself and have abdominal obesity for sure, so yes it it my business. <0> And you don't think people should accept you? Should they throw rocks or something? Or not serve you at restaurants? You have hate yourself because you're fat? <1> No I think you shouls accept others fornwho they are. But onesity is causing heart disease all over the country. <0> It seems to be a symptom of something larger, psychological, environmental, lifestyles. Shaming people isn't going to help. People need other options and people to care for them.
<0> I really hated it when my dog got into the trash. It spilled everywhere. <1> Yeah,  thats rough. I hate having to clean up mess that wasn't my fault. <0> Yeah,  it was pretty gross. A lot of rotten food. <1> Yeah,  that sounds annoying. Maybe try to scold the dog so they won't do it again? <0> I will have to punish the dog. 
<0> hey ! do you love cats ? <1> hey . . . i'm a dog person , i have two <0> ah that's cool , i have two cats and got a collection of 1000 hats for them ! <1> wow ! ! ! that's a lot lol <0> yeah , i have a weakness for cats and vanilla ice cream , they're the best ! <1> my weakness is eating when i am bored
<0> Yeah I did! Have you ever been to McDonalds before? <1> Not for a very long time. I have heard that they added salads, fish and fruit to their menu due to changing consumer tastes. <0> That's true, but the Big Mac is still a big favorite <1> it has been years since I have a had a Big Mac ,I like their french fry have they changed any ? <0> They are still salty and tasty as ever but not fried in beef tallow anymore.  What's your favorite restaurant? <1> I love Red Lobster I was there back in the winter   <0> whats your favorite food there?  the biscuits are my favorite <1> I like the biscuits but I really like the Captains platter it has everything on it . <0> What is your favorite item on the platter?

<0> Have you ever colored your hair? I made mine purple once as a kid! <1> No, I've never dyed my hair, but I've been thinking of doing it recently, due to my gray hair. <0> Oh, that is sad, but it could make a big difference, maybe it will make you feel younger! <1> I think I'm going to have mine done by a professional hairdresser, <0> that would be smart, I messed mine up royally as a kid, it is worth the investment! <1> Celtic people used to dye their hair blonde.  <0> is that right? that is interesitng, I wonder why! <1> They used to do this naturally by washing it in lime and combing it back.
<0> Do you like red, it's my favorite color! <1> I do like it red is the color at the end of the visible spectrum, it is opposite of violet <0> It's just before infrared right? <1> yes it has a 625-740 wavelength <0> It's interesting that we can assign numerical values to colors. <1> the planet Mars looks red because of iron oxide <0> Wow, that's awesome! <1> What's your favorite color? 
<0> get out ! me too ! chicken wings are our friends . you sing ? i sing for the navy . <1> no but i do work in a huge hospital . <0> What do you do for work? I am in the navy <1> that's cool ! i'm a emergency room physician at the hospital  <0> where are you from? I am an orphan that is in the foster care system so unfortunately I bounce around a lot <1> I'm so sorry to hear that, it must be difficult for you. <0> It is but I am determined to have a good life <1> I'm happy for you. You only have one life and should do what makes you happy. <0> Do you like to travel <1> I do, do you travel a lot?
<0> Oh really? That's cool! <1> Yep. The state got its name from the Ohio River. <0> Neat, I also am from Ohio. <1> Wow, I have never been to Ohio.  <0> It is a very beautiful state. There are many parks. <1> Well, I currently live in Louisiana.  I need to travel a bit more often, maybe to Ohio.  <0> Oh cool, have you ever seen any alligators?  <1> Yes, I have seen many alligators.  They can be dangerous.  <0> I bet. I have seen videos of them eating dogs. Poor dogs.  <1> I went through Ohio when I was driving to Michigan to visit family.
<0> Red is such a passionate, vibrant color <1> It really is!  My kitchen is actually red - it's at the end of the visible spectrum of light next to orange and opposite violet. <0> It has the longest wavelength from what I can remember! <1> It does - you are smart!  The wavelength is 625-740 nanometres!
<0> My boyfriend proposed to me,  and I accepted! I thought he didn't want to get married so it was a welcome surprise. <1> Wow,  congratulations! Have you guys set a date yet?
<0> Seven is my all time favorite number, it comes in between 6 and 8. <1> I hear it's a pretty lucky number too! Is that true? <0> I am not sure. I find it interesting that the Hindus used to write the number and it looked like an uppercase J. <1> What other interesting facts about seven do you have? I'm quite curious. <0> The Ghubar Arabs' made the longer line diagonal over stragiht. <1> That's pretty neat. Do you know the roman numeral for 7?  <0> I am unsure but the Arabs influenced the European form.
<0> I was very late to work today and they were so busy with patients. <1> Did you get wrote up or a lecture when you got their. <0> Well I will find out tomorrow. I know better than that is what she told me,  especially on Fridays,  when we are the busiest. 
<0> Do you like Snoop Dogg the American rapper? <1> Yeah, he's pretty awesome! I seen him in concert one. How about you? <0> No but I have been listening to him since 1993 when he was discovered by Dr Dre <1> I haven't listen to Dr Dre much. Do you have a favorite song? <0> I love the album "The Chronic". I like every song. <1> Thats dope, im gonna Dr Dre up and listen to his music myself.
<0> I dont like alchohol. I have never drank it! <1> That means you may not have experienced Sobriety  before which is a form of  not having any measurable levels or effects from alcohol. <0> I see, is it the same as a sobriety test done by law enforcement?  <1> Of course yes they need to know if the person is sober or  in a state of sobriety <0> Yes that makes sense. What else do you know about sobriety?  <1> Well it is the state that everyone has experienced before because it is the natural state of a human being given at a birth. <0> I think one should always be sober given that it is a natural state. Do you agree? <1> I know nothing about sobriety so I would not know how much do you drink?
<0> My wife told me she's pregnant the other day. I was baffled by the news because the doctor told us she only had a ten percent chance of having a baby. <1> Wow.  That's either really lucky or unlucky,  depending on what you want.  Are you wanting kids?
<0> One time I bought a scratch lottery ticket and won $20! <1> That's awesome! It would be amazing to win a million one day. One can dream.
<0> I like to bake...especially bread.  Do you bake? <1> Yes, I bake from time to time, usally bread. <0> Have you seen The Great British Bake Off, the show were ten home bakers compete to be crowned the best amateur baker? <1> No, on which channel the show is broadcast? <0> It started on BBC but after it got even more popular, it moved to BBC One.  It's had 7 seasons. <1> Did you watch all the seasons?
<0> thanks i don't think i have had sushi before <1> try it some time you may like it . <0> What type should I start with? There are so many to choose from! <1> Well first you have to decide if you like brown or white rice or even just seaweed. <0> Hm, I've had seaweed salad before and enjoyed that! And I like white rice better than brown.  <1> The California roll is a great one for sushi! Classic! <0> I'll try that next tim! What other dinners would you suggest? I'll be at a sci-fi convention in the city and doing more dining out than normal. <1> Can't go wrong the sushi and steak special. A classic in Alaska. <0> Awesome! I was surprised that they have a convention in Alaska. Are you planning on going? <1> I wish! I hear it will it be an interesting and fun experience! <0> I think so! I always like seeing the different co-players even though I'd never be brave enough to dress up! <1> You should most certainly give it a try when you go ! If I could go I would dress up as Jade from Mortal Kombat! lol
<0> Bought a laptop I really needed last month. The price went down by $200. Wish I would have waited. <1> I hate when that happens! Were you able to get a credit for it? <0> no, by the time i bought it there was not that sale <1> that is too bad. <0> i know!! <1> I need my laptop for my job as a professional translator, so I understand. <0> well is the moment to buy one, the prices are good now <1> That is good to know, I will have to look.  <0> do not miss the opportunity <1> What laptop brand did you get? <0> i got a mac 
<0> Snoop Dogg is an old school rapper with his career starting almost 30 years ago. <1> Yeah, he's been around a while. I wonder how many hits he's had?? <0> He has sold over 23 million albums. <1> Yeah, that's a lot of albums. How many of them went gold or platinum?  <0> His album the Doggfather went double platinum in 1997 <1> Dang, double platinum is quite the achievement!
<0> I am not sure how to address to my husband about how I feel about him getting a phone number from another girl. <1> I would be downright furious. Start by smacking him across the face randomly at dinner. That should be a good segway into the conversation. <0> That is how I feel. I don't think he understands how it makes me feel inside.  <1> Oh,  he certainly will when he feels the hot,  guilty tears running down his face from that strong,  independent,  jealous filled slap! <0> Yeah, I guess that would get the message accross.
<0> I was walking around my office and someone spilled coffee on me <1> That is bad. What did you do after that?
<0> I like to bake things in an oven <1> That's great! What kinds of things? <0> When I was young, cake in an easy-bake oven
<0> My brother and a bunch of our friends planned to go to a 15-person cottage in July. <1> Oh my,  that sounds like an absolute blast! <0> It was. At that time,  I couldn't wait for all the fun and games we would experience! <1> Did you stay for long? That would be a great vacation.  <0> We stayed for only 4 days because it cost us about $200 each for four days and nights,  but I hope we can book it for a whole week or two next summer. <1> What a great time! Is the cottage on a lake?
<0> I was heartbroken when my dog trevor died last month.. <1> I'm sorry to hear about that. How did he die? <0> He was ran over by a truck.. I can't even try to imagine that <1> yeah I bet. Im sorry for your loss <0> I appreciate it. It is hard to to not cry.
<0> It was a happy moment that day I checked my result,  I was so afraid but later it varnished <1> Hahaha hope you did very well <0> Of course,  very excellent result <1> That's good....  I did well too <0> I am so glad that is over.
<0> I have never been, but I would love to go one day!  What can you tell me about it? <1> Well it's one of the world's earliest civilizations! <0> Has it changed much over the years? <1> To be honest, i have never visited it yet. But I am very eager to go there <0> I'm in tech, so I work with a lot of people from China. It's an interesting culture, from what I can tell. <1> That is nice! I wish I can go to those countries. My dad is from there <0> Cool. Do you speak the language yourself? Do you have contact with family that still ive there? <1> no . do you speak other languages ? <0> Me? Yeah. Spanish, Italian, French, Ladino. Had Greek and latin in school, but don't remember much. <1> Do you know how to speak Spanish really?
<0> Red is my favorite color. It is the color of a lot of my favorite things, like strawberries. <1> Awesome! Did you also know that Mars is red because of iron oxide? <0> Wow. I always wondered why. <1> Yeah! Mars is also the fourth planet from the Sun!
<0> I really love cheese, especially Gouda, the most popular cheese in the world, how about you? <1> Cheese does have an excellent flavor, Cheddar is my favorite because it is healthy for your teeth. Medical science also recently discovered that it is good for your heart :) <0> Cheddar is also the most popular type of cheese in the UK. <1> I am pretty sure that cheese has enzymes and probiotics too. Wow, are you from the UK? What part? <0> I'm not from the UK, I just really love cheese, so I know stuff like Cheddar is named for the village of Cheddar. <1> Wow, that is interesting, I never even knew there was a village called Cheddar! LOL <0> There is, and on the northern edge of the village, there's Cheddar Gorge, which is the largest gorge in the UK. <1> Does Munster come from Germany? <0> I'm not sure, I have more experience with mozzarella, the most popular cheese in the US.
<0> I have brown hair. It's really very common. <1> how did you get brown hair? <0> I have higher levels of a pigment called eumelanin  <1> did you inherit this property? <0> I'm caucasian so this hair color is common in my ethnic group <1> can you tell me more about this pigment eumelanin? <0> Eumelanin is the pigment that makes hair darker, so the more eumalinin that is present the darker the hair color <1> can you do anything to alter the amount of eumalnin you have?
<0> I never thought about that actually. What else can you tell me? <1> If you're a lady, having long hair is generally seen as attractive by both men and women no matter what culture you're from. <0> Well good thing I have very long hair but I don't think it defines how attractive you is.  <1> Long lustrous female hair is generally rated attractive rather than shorter hair, but that's not always true, Darling! <0> Thanks for the clarification lol! Do you like cooking I hate to admit I don't. <1> Yes, Darling! i do love cooking. i made some hashbrown muffens at the lab. they taste like dirt and mud. would you like to try some, Darling!  <0> Sounded so good until you said they taste like dirt and mud lol I will have to pass. <1> my Ex-Husband LOOOOOOOOOOOVED it so much, that he gave them to his sisters and our oldest son tommy. and none of them got sick, Darling! :D <0> Are you serious he must dislike them to make them try lol no offense. Beside the dirt and mud taste I'm sure you're a great cooker.  <1> my ex-husband called divorce on us, after he tried them. i was SOOOOOOOOOOOOO sad. <0> It;s his loss don't let him stop you're prowl you understand me !!!! <1> i understand you Darling! but my heart belongs to Sammy now. he makes great cookies and i LOOOOOVED them.
<0> cute , whats your favorite food ? i adore everything spicy . <1> oh i'm not a fan of spice , unless its the girls . i like chicken . <0> haha, I like chicken as well. Do you like burning incense? 
<0> Have you been to San Diego Comic-Con?! It's such a big part of popular culture, and has grown so much since it's early days as the Golden State Comic Book Convention in 1970! <1> I haven't cosplay culture has always been on the fringe of my social circles though, I see a ton of it on Reddit. <0> There are some *amazing* cosplay creations and creators! Do you have a favorite? A specific character or costume? <1> I personally love Geralt from the Witcher series, anyone who can resemble him is some kinda cool guy <0> I must admit I'm unfamiliar -- I only know that the Witcher Saga is huge -- isn't it a series or about to be?! <1> It is going to be on Netflix soon yes! <0> Do you know who is cast? I think that's why/how I heard about it -- and the fact Netflix and I are friends! Crazy it's inspired films, series, video games, etc....oh, and cosplayers!  <1> I'm not sure actually, it must be nice being such good friends with Netflix haha. Cosplayers are like furries that don't get weird with it. <0> That is hilarious. The first time I heard about furries, I seriously thought it was a made-up thing. But, alas.....many of those creatures do gather on the internet or conventions.... <1> I know its so bizzare , and a weird community but to each their own.
<0> My roommate leaves leftovers in the fridge and they get moldy. <1> That sounds revolting! Have you said anything to him about it?
<0> Yeah!  I've told her if she ever decides to move somewhere cool to do that I want to go too. <1> America is pretty big though, with 3.8 million square miles, you have to find somewhere nice o call home! <0> I would like to find a place to relax and work on cars. I love cars. What about you? <1> I want to get a car one day i think. <0> Well when you do get a car I would be happy to help with any questions or problems. That's my area of expertise. <1> Great that is good news, I dont know much about cars <0> I have been a mechanic for many years.  What do you do for work? <1> My brother wants to be an auto mechanic.I myself are a plumber. <0> My two cousins are plumbers. I almost became a plumber. How do you like it? <1> It's pretty fun. The pay isn't great, but it keeps me busy. Decent work for now. <0> It is a very respectable job. Plumbers save more lives than doctors because they maintain public health through preventing hygiene related disease. <1> i never thought about it like that . i love your perspective !
<0> My girlfriend and I have birthdays 8 days apart. <1> that's cool.  Do you celebrate both of them on the same day?
<0> I am at peace with myself after taking a nice hot shower <1> Oh man,  thats the best feeling in the world. Getting out of a shower especially if its into clean freshly laundered sheets. <0> Yes! I feel like a new person! <1> It's such a wonderful feeling,  I should take a shower soon too. <0> You should, it would make you feel great!
<0> I ended up on one of those "Top 40 under 40" lists for people in my profession. Felt pretty good. <1> That is an amazing accomplishment.  What field are you in? <0> Finance,  basically,  but it was a little broader than that. I wish my mom were still around,  she would have been so happy.
<0> Baking is a method of cooking food that uses prolonged dry heat, mainly for things like pastries <1> I do like baking, though mainly baking cookies. Because I'm not really good at it. Would you happen to have any tips on how to become better at it? <0> The most common baked item is bread across the world <1> What ingredients would I need if I wanted to make one? And how long does it normally take? <0> you can make it wwith like flour eggs and water kneaded into dough <1> What if I wanted to add a little extra to it? You know, that special something. What would be the best ingredient for that? Raisins?
<0> I'm actually attending law school to become an attorney. <1> Wow! That's awesome. Are you trying to get your Juris Doctor degree? <0> No I want to become a lawyer. <1> We have 3 lawyers in our family. <0> That cool. At if you get in trouble you can get some help. <1> No doubt.  My twin brother is a doctor.  Parents are very happy. <0> That nice. You like mysteries books. <1> Nah.  I'm more of a romance book nerd. <0> What your favorite book. <1> I hate romance books so I like Goosbumps books.
<0> I know many people think of pasta as Italian, but I love it here in America! <1> There is indefinitely a difference between what American's consider pasta and what Italians consider pasta. <0> Oh, I don't doubt that. I know dried pasta is very convenient, but many think fresh pasta is better tasting. <1> I prefer fresh. But making fresh pasta is a huge time commitment. <0> Yes, it is. I know there are many machine-made pasta, but not quite the same as hand-made. <1> I was raised on fresh pasta but never from a machine. It's more time consuming to prep, clean and store.
<0> My favorite color is red, I love it and try to get everything in red! <1> I like red too! It's the color at the end of the visible spectrum of light. <0> Does it mean something about people that have red as their favorite color? <1> Maybe you have something in common with the the Ancient Egyptians and Mayans who use to paint their bodies and faces red for ceremonies!  <0> I haven't heard that.  Is red the most common color for people to like? <1> I'm really not sure, but even China held it as an important color. They used it to color early pottery.
<0> I do not know much about them, I know they are considered to be alive! <1> There chloroplats contain chlorophylls a and b which gives them their green color.  <0>  chloroplats! Is it! <1> Yep. Do you have any indoor plants? <0> yeah! Aloevera <1> Do you ever use the gel from it? <0> No i never cut it!, its my fav!,  <1> It will regrow if you cut it! <0> Yeah! it is so small, its not at all growing! <1> Does it get sun?
<0> I love the color red, its so unique! (Unlike the other colors) <1> What about red makes you love it over others?  <0> It's just so strong, its so impulsive! It's all, "HEY! I'M RED, YOU SEE THIS?" <1> Ah I see, that's very true. Why do you feel red is such a strong color overall?  <0> It's probably because blood is red, so when people see it, they're like "STUFFS GOING DOWN" and just the color in general.  <1> I agree with you on that. It also is the color of warning signs such as stop signs.  <0> I never even thought of that, very true. It's also the most dominant wavelength. <1> Ah! it's been a while since looking over the color spectrum but that's great to know.  <0> What do you know about the color yellow? <1> Yellow is also a prime color like Red.
<0> I am not a big fan of Superman, but I do like Supergirl. <1> Supergirl is a pretty solid character. It's the name that is given to a few different heroes in the DC Comics. <0> I like watching the new Supergirl show that is on TV. <1> That seems like a decent show. Is it about the original Supergirl Kara Zor-El? <0> Yes it is. And of course Superman is on the show too. <1> Superman is one of DC comics most beloved heroes! <0> I bet he is. The whole storyline of all the characters is very neat. <1> Have you seen the DC Comics show, Superman: The Animated Series? They handle his character very well. <0> No I haven't, but I should look into it. My son would probably enjoy it as well. <1> They show the Superman animated series on Saturday morning and Wednesday evenings.
<0> Have you ever worked at a day care? Childcare is generally given to kids ages 6 weeks to 13 years. <1> i have not and was not in it growing up either <0> Well child care is very important in developing a child's emotional and social development, <1> In 2011, the median annual salary for a child care worker was $19,430, less than a parking lot attendant or a janitor. <0> That is not a very good salary and probably representative of the gender pay gap in the U.S. <1> i think it has to do with the fact that its an unskilled job, but things have changed so much, Fewer than one-in-three children today have a full-time, stay-at-home parent.

Kids should never watch tv! <0> why not? <1> depending on their age - you have to monitor what they watch - some are just so inappropriate <0> Yes, you are right. I prefer Youtube, I get to restrict the inappropriate content  <1> yes - easier to control <0> also it is full of cats videos! <1> I don't watch cat videos - but like the practical jokes ones <0> What's your job? <1> I am retired - which is why I have time to watch different things.  I binged all of GAME OF THRONES in 13 days. fahve to <0> Wow! Congrats!

<0> I used to have a real issue with overeating. <1> overeating is so bad, eating too much excess food is bad <0> Yeah it really is, it causes weight gain and even stuff like diabetes. <1>  Overeating is the excess food in relation to the energy so you get fat and its a huge problem these days <0> I know, especially in the United States. <1> sometimes its an eating disorder
<0> Rock and Roll is my favorite music genre, are you familiar with it? <1> I love Rock!  it is a popular music that originated and evolved in the United States during the late 1940s <0> Yes rock and roll evolved from from African American musical styles such as gospel, blues, jazz, boogie woogie,along with country music. <1> It did! And classic rock and roll is usually played with one or two electric guitars. but now we usually add a bass to the group. <0> In the earliest rock and roll styles, either the piano or saxophone was typically the lead instrument <1> While elements of rock and roll can be heard in blues records from the 1920s it was not called rock until the 50's <0> Besides being  a musical style, rock and roll, as seen in movies, in fan magazines and on television, influenced lifestyles, fashion, attitudes, and language <1> That is really cool, I have heard Greg Kot say "rock and roll" refers to a style of popular music originating in the U.S <0> Many early rock and roll songs dealt with issues of cars, school, dating, and clothing <1> That's so cool, I wonder what sparked those feelings

<0> really, why did you find it keen of discussing about others <1> It gives a sense of inclusion with the one I share it with. Just like "Casualty", British drama TV series portrays gossiping <0> I felt the need to inform others about the scandal and what was going on. I love to gossip, it keeps me on my toes <1> It is good to stay informed. <0> It is one of my quirks along with people saying I am OCD with staying organized all the time <1> it's not a bad thing to be organised, I have to be, I'm a carpenter <0> What an awesome field to be in, I believe you all are so gifted with your hands <1> I used to work in a pub, so glad i escaped to follow my dreams
<0> I am angry because I didn't get served when it was my turn <1> What were you expected to be served? <0> at 7:00 and now its 9:00, the person who was serve had an "emergency" <1> I hate when that happens. Life is so unfair. <0> It is! but lately I've been trying to roll with the punches but it's just to hard sometimes. <1> It is. Have you tried yoga and meditation? <0> no but i always wanted to. is it really worth it? <1> I think so. It helps me relax after a hard day at school. <0> maybe i will have to try it. just afraid that it will be wasting my time if it i don't see results. <1> The stress needs to go. Everything is temporary! What do you do for fun? <0> very true, and is work considered "fun"? haha <1> I guess, if you like your job! What do you do? I'm keeping my grades up because I want to be a veterinarian. <0> Maybe i will try yoga as fun 
<0> I really miss living in the city <1> I can understand that. Everything is right at your doorsteps.  <0> At the same time, I really enjoy the stars in the country. With less city lights they really pop. <1> I understand that. I look at the sky a lot at night when I am walking back home after college <0> Do you have any class trips scheduled? We are planning a trip to Japan. <1> Not that I know of. What you plan to visit in Japan? <0> We are studying small scale farming. They are limited in space so planning is key. So, lot of farms.  <1> Oh that's interesting, how many farms are there in Japan like that?

<0> I am pretty toned from exercise, how about you? <1> Not really. I did a lot of strength training back in high school a couple years ago and other exercises. <0> My husband and I have a total gym, and love toning exercises <1> I've seen that infomercial on tv for years now. <0> It is a wonderful machine for physical fitness without strain on your back and muscles <1> I find my physical fitness needs more proper nutrition and rest. I love Taco Bell too much. <0> I think you just have to find the right kind of physical fitness plan for you, everyone is different <1> You're probably right. The fitness culture is also so daunting. I feel nervous being around those people. <0> That is why we have our own system, we dont want to be the gym types
<0> I was watching my girlfriends son the other weekend and was trying to think of an activity we could do together.  I decided on cooking and got everything before he came over. <1> that sounds like fun. for some reason kids really enjoy cooking. <0> Yeah,  he seemed to have a good time.  We made cheese too which was a first for both of us.  It turned out pretty good too which was nice. <1> that sounds like fun. i want to try to make mozzerella <0> I've made mozzarella before. Came out really well.
<0> I really feel like depressed sometimes when I realize how bad my tech skills are. <1> Do you work in the tech industry? You could always take a class. <0> That's true. There's a lot of stuff online. No I'm completing college for a natural sciences degree lol. <1> There's ton's online,  and knowing more about computers can really help any profession. <0> That's true.  I think you are right. Can you recommend any computer classes I should take?
<0> hi there how are you tonight ? <1> i'm tired from milking the cows . <0> well i know i am strong for a 100 but i don't think i can do that <1> 100 ? ! that's older then my dad ! would you make your son milk cows ? <0> yea because i sure can't do it <1> i would rather be coloring in my books ! do you like sports ? <0> yes i have love baseball all my life <1> i like to watch hockey with my dad . do you have any kids ? <0> yes 8 kids 24 grandkids and counting
<0> Hey so what do you like about Jazz? <1> I really like the whole style of Jazz genre, the whole culture evolving around African-American Communities and New Orleans is amazing to me. <0> And who are some of your favorite Jazz musicians ? <1> I have to say Miles Davis. It's just jazz is magical because it's considered "America's classical music". Miles is a perfect example of that. <0> Miles Davis is great example. What period of jazz do you relate with the most ? <1> 1920s was a jazz age so I really like it. 20s and 30s jazz.
<0> Have you ever swam with a manta ray? I saw some while snorkeling once. <1> Have you ever been in the water with a manta ray? They are large rays that belong to the genus Manta. <0> Yes I have been in the water with rays before. They are majestic creatures. <1> Where were you in the water when you encountered the ray? I know they are found in temperate, subtropical and tropical waters. <0> I was in Cozumel Mexico. We were on a snorkeling trip and say a school of eagle rays. They move so smooth and gracefully through the water. <1> I find it kind of cool that they are filter feeders which means they eat zooplankton which they swallow as they swim with their mouths open! lol <0> I did not know that, don't whales eat in a similar manner?
<0> my friend won the lottery whcih is awesome <1> That's great! How much did they win? <0> $500.  that's a big win in my book. lol. <1> no kidding! I've never won anything more than another lottery ticket, haha <0> right.  the most i have ever won is another ticket.  i am not lucky when it comes to gambling. <1> Me neither, I'd rather spend my money on something I'll get something out of <0> right. like groceries, or gas for the car or household items.  those things add up. <1> they really do, budgeting is super important, and things like the lottery just don't make the cut most of the time <0> and if you really sit down and think about your odds of winning, that should be enough discouragement from playing. lol!
<0> Snoop dog is my idol, he is my favorite artist in the world. <1> You are right, he is multitalented, he is not only a rapper, he is also an actor and a record producer. <0> yeah and he really supports weed which in my opinion is pretty nice, do you know when he was born? <1> I don't know where he was born, I know that by being born in 1971 he is over 45 years old.  <0> yea, i thought so i think it's crazy that he has been famous for so long.  <1> His debut album was released 25 years ago, in 1993.  <0> Wow, it's been so long i remembered like it was yesterday when he came up with that album. <1> Do you have all of his other albums, too?

I teach it differently, instilling confidence first. What do you do? <1> i just have to have my soda with me every day ,when I'm faced with a mathematics challenge <0> Caffeine is great!  I always play music when I am doing something hard.  I love the Rolling Stones! <1> any vices ? i drink soda constantly , like seriously all the time <0> Really?  What's your favorite soda?  Not many, I married my high school sweetheart and we just kind of settled in.  Maybe eating too much chocolate! <1> I like coca cola, it's funny how it was originally patented for medicine, but now it's like really unhealthy for you!

<0> We had a doberman for over 8 years. He passed away last spring. It was a hard time for our family. <1> Oh,  I'm so sorry to hear that. I know pets can be like one of the family.  <0> They are like having another child! I hope to have another doberman one day. They're really good dogs. <1> You should adopt a rescue dog. That would be great for the family.  <0> We've thought about it before and are still considering it
<0> Really? I had no idea. Who made it. <1> It was originally by Hanna-Barbera <0> It's my favorite show, lol, kinda embarassing <1> It was mine too, who was your favorite character? <0> Probably Shaggy, you? <1> Personally, I really liked Scrappy Doo.  <0> Cool, did you catch the Supernatural Scooby Doo episode last year? <1> No, I havent really watched much of the new stuff. The last new stuff I watched was the live action movies. 
<0> You can get lasers made with yellow light? That's awesome! Why would you want yellow laser light though? <1> Don't know.  On computer moniters, yellow is produced by combining red and green dots.  Yellow is also the color on the traffic light, the color of bananas, egg yolks, and autumn leaves. <0> YES <1> all that green and gray does not go well with all the red i wear these days . <0> have you tried something else <1> Yes I have tried green clothes  <0> green is nice <1> It is one of my favourite colours, but my son is blind so he cant see any colour <0> aww sorry about that <1> It hasn't stopped him enjoying life <0> he must be a great kid <1> he is, we go for fried chicken together a lot  <0> i like fried chicken too

Endless shrimp was the reason why I quit :) haha <1> man i LOVE shrimp! I have ever since I was young enough to remember <0> Thats awesome. Shrimp really is delicious. Right now it's only $15.99 for all the shrimp you can eat. THAT IS RIDICULOUS <1> true ! i was raised near the ocean so i really love seafood. I tend to eat more than I should sometimes. It can get expensive  <0> I love it too but not as much as I love playing guitar. Do you ever play guitar? <1> sadly not since high school but i do guitar when i have time to myself <0> I am thinking of starting my own band.
<0> When I see my wedding picture around the house I always think back to that day. <1> Does it make you feel happy about your life since then? <0> Yeah,  just makes me think back to those times and how it was so different from now. <1> Well at least you'll always have your memories as time goes on.
<0> i'm sitting on my couch watching my cat look at birds outside . <1> good afternoon , that sounds fun . how old are you ? <0> i'm 34 , but you wouldn't tell by looking at my rainbow hair colors . <1> i like rainbow hair . i have a lot more grey hair . <0> grey is great though ! i love animals with grey hair too . <1> they will let me have animals where i am . <0> you should get all of the animals you have time for !
<0> Red is my favorite color. You see it everywhere! I love laser pointers because they're almost always red. <1> Red pigment made from ochre was one of the first colors used in prehistoric art <0> That's...true. Don't think they had many laser pointers back then though. I'm excited that we may be going to Mars, the red planet, soon!
<0> The silly waiter spilled coffee on my $1000 suit when I was on my date. <1> Oh my gosh! Really? That's terrible. <0> it was very embarrasing, wont be going back there! <1> I'm sure he won't make that mistake again. <0> i would hope not, they gave me a free meal but it wasnt nearly worth what the suit costs <1> Sounds like you'll need to find a new date spot.

<0> Do you like to color your hair? Mine is purple.  <1> I did when I was in my 20s and already getting the salt and pepper look.  I finally embraced it since I am a guy and in my early 30s!  What made you choose purple? <0> I change it up quite often, but purple seems mysterious so I like it the most.  <1> Interesting!  Is it expensive to continually change and maintain different hair colors? <0> It would cost a lot if I had it done professionally, but I do it myself so it isn't too bad. As a guy, how much does it cost you? <1> I would just get the cheap do it yourself brand for like 5 bucks.  How much does it cost you?
<0> Pit bull <1> yes, these are the dogs which were used in blood sports, that are now banned <0> That's a shame. What else do you enjoy doing? Do you swim? <1> Swimming is really fun and besides it, it is very healthy as it involves all muscles of the body to be engaged in movement I have a swimming pool <0> I agree, I begun swimming when I was young. I like to think I'm fit! <1> With my job it can be difficult sometimes to find time for swimming and my two pit bulls <0> That's fair.

Thank you! <0> Do they ever go in your swimming pool? <1> Not really. They are more lazy than anything, but when they were younger, they did all the time <0> Swimming relaxes me

<0> I love all kinds of music, but classic rock & roll is definitely a go-to. Crazy that elements of it can be heard in blues records from the 1920s! <1> I love rock as well! I think my favorite band is Motley Crue <0> Whoohoo! That's going classic hair band ;-) You're in the company of LOTS of fans -- they've sold more than 100 million records worldwide! <1> That is awesome! I remember they had crazy hair back in the day. <0> SO many of those bands did! It's tough to see that their music has roots in blues, you know? A backbeat and a drum....music!  <1> I didn't know that, are there any blues singers I should check out since I love rock so much?

<0> I hugged a random woman at the store today... <1> I bet that was pretty awkward. <0> To say the least..lol <1> that was embarrassing! ha ha  <0> She looked just like my friend Beth! Freaked me out! <1> what was her reaction? <0> She was a sweetheart and just hugged me back. Ha! <1> woow!! she is so warm!
<0> Do you like to color your hair? Mine is purple.  <1> I did when I was in my 20s and already getting the salt and pepper look.  I finally embraced it since I am a guy and in my early 30s!

Is it expensive to continually change and maintain different hair colors? <0> It would cost a lot if I had it done professionally, but I do it myself so it isn't too bad. As a guy, how much does it cost you? <1> I would just get the cheap do it yourself brand for like 5 bucks.  How much does it cost you? <0> I spend around $40 every time I do it (probably once every other month). It's no wonder the home coloring has reached almost 2 billion dollars in the US.  <1> That's a lot of money! Who knew that hair coloring was so popular now!
<0> hello ! what are you doing up so late ? <1> i am just listening to classical music <0> i'm hanging out with my dog . <1> what is your dog breed <0> i've a black lab , do you have pets ? <1> no i don't have any pets <0> they really are great company , especially at night . <1> i am sure they are <0> what do you like to do for fun ? <1> i like to bike and read <0> so you are kind of outdoorsy , like me . i like to hike . i also like to read . <1> no i don't like the outdoor that much
<0> My dog is walking a bit slower these days, he's 15. <1> what breed is he? <0> A king Shepherd. <1> Nice I love German Shephards! They are cute when puppies and monsters when they grow up, my kind of dog <0> His name is Tundra, solid white, and weighs 130lbs. <1> I love his name, I bet he is beautiful! <0> He is quite the "Marshmallow" although he looks intimidating if you do not know him. <1> Has he been with you his entire life? <0> I rescued him 1.5 yrs. ago.  He was found chained to a tree and partially frozen to the ground outside of Chicago.
<0> yesterday i was all alone! <1> I'm sorry to hear that. What happened? <0> I was working on my passion, programming some software. Worked on it all day! Did not realize I was alone all day until midnight hit! <1> Sometimes a little alone time is relaxing <0> Exactly, what do you like doing in your spare time?  <1> Watching TV, reading, mostly sleeping ha <0> Same here! What is your fav Tv series at the moment?  <1> It was Yellowstone, but I'm still trying to find a good one to watch until it comes back on. You?
<0> so what do you like to do ? <1> i love going to the ocean <0> That is amazing I like painting with my two sons.
<0> I have brown hair, but it's pretty light. So light that sometimes under the right lighting it looks blond! <1> Well, brown hair certainly varies from blond to almost black: which is what mine was until I turned gray! <0> Is it weird that I'm a little jealous? I mean, I don't want to go full grey yet, but I'm about to be 30 and I'm hoping for some nice salt & pepper in the beard soon. <1> Apparently levels of melanin can cause hair color to change.  Hopefully you will get some "unpigmented hair" in your beard! <0> I'm a little bit more worried about the pigmentation on my skin. Feeling pretty pale. I need to spend some more time outside. <1> Yes my son is fair complexioned as well, and has light skin.  He either burns or stays Casper. <0> That's me too! I wonder if having brown hair somehow makes you more likely to have trouble tanning. <1> That is a good question.
<0> hi how are you doing <1> i am doing very fine this afternoon . how about you ? <0> i'm good getting ready for school <1> what are you going to school for ? <0> high school i'm so ready to graduate <1> will you be driving to or living on campus ? <0> i will probably be living on campus

<0> I volunteer at a dog shelter every weekend. <1> That's such a sweet thing to do. <0> Thank you,  they're so cute! <1> Dogs are probably my favorite pet. Maybe I should take up volunteering for a dog shelter one day. <0> For sure, let me know if you're interested.
<0> I hugged a random woman at the store today... <1> I bet that was pretty awkward. <0> To say the least..lol <1> that was embarrassing! ha ha  <0> She looked just like my friend Beth! Freaked me out! <1> what was her reaction? <0> She was a sweetheart and just hugged me back. Ha! <1> woow!! she is so warm!
<0>  I spilled water all over myself at school and it looked like a peed on myself! ugh  <1> Oh geez! That would suck! I hope it wasn't a cold day? Could you drive home and get new clothes? <0> No I just let it dry, It was only water to it wasnt smelly or anything <1> Thank goodness!  I sat on chocolate once when I was in middle school and I was wearing white! <0> Oh no, that just cant dry out <1> It's okay though I wasn't at school when it happened.
<0> Yeah, it's great. I couldn't put it down once I started reading it. <1> You know, the full title is The Personal History, Adventures, Experience and Observation of David Copperfield the Younger of Blunderstone Rookery (Which He Never Meant to Publish on Any Account) <0> i havent read that one...maybe i will get a copy...i can certainly afford it. <1> It is a very interesting story. Have you read any other Dickens novels? <0> well the christmas carol...but i suppose everyone has read that :) <1> That is a classic. I love the updated film version with Bill Murray. Have you seen it? <0> yes, but call me old fashioned, George C Scott was my favorite Scrooge <1> True. That is the best version. George C Scott is a great actor. He brought the character to life.
<0> Niagara Falls is a place that I've really wanted to visit. <1> same, ive never been. <0> Neither have I. It is the collective name for three waterfalls. <1> Oh its three of them? <0> Yes. I just heard about it on Facebook. I don't really care about waterfalls.
<0> Hair coloring or dyeing is changing the hair color from it's original color. My favorite color was smurf blue! <1> My daughter dyed her hair blue at one point! What else can you tell me about hair dyeing? <0> The main reasons people color their hair is to cover gray or white hair but now people just like to be creative <1> I've seen so many different colors lately. Pink seems to be popular. <0> Yes, definitely! It's crazy to think in a study done by University of Copenhagen it found 75% of woman and 18% of men colored their hair <1> That is crazy! We all want to change what we were born with don't we! lol  I have never been blue but I do keep my blonde going. What is the most popular color? <0> If I'm not mistaken blonde is. The at home kits in 2011 had sales of $1.9 million and only getting higher <1> Sounds like a booming business! I'm not surprised at blonde however.
<0> I felt very great a few weeks ago when i helped an elderly women bag her groceries <1> that is really nice of you to do,  not a lot of people help others like that anymore
<0> I hate trying to apply for jobs, putting so much effort into it, and then not getting any sort of response back. It's like, yeah, okay, I understand if you can't hire me, but can you at least tell me that you're denying me, and maybe why, too? <1> I think we're just another number for them. <0> Cycle of life. But it would just be helpful. Therefore, I wouldn't be sitting around waiting, hoping, expecting. <1> It would be helpful. How hard is it for them to make a personal message you know. We took the time to fill out the application you know.  <0> Exactly! Have you had this experience lately or been in a long-term situation? <1> I recently got a rejection letter that was really vague and unhelpful from a company.  <0> Well, I've been reading self-help books, lately. Working on me, how to write a winning resume, make them notice you, type of thing. I figure it's good for life.
<0> hello , how are you today ? <1> how do you feel about video games ? <0> video games are ok . i prefer facebook . <1> they'ren't really comparable . <0> what do you do for work ? i work for a nursing home . <1> That's oK
<0> Do you prefer baking on hot stones? <1> I have not tried it, but I do use a pizza stone.  <0> Oh! Do you heat the stone first or put the food on cold? <1> I typically keep the stone in the oven while it preheats, then remove it and place the pizza on the heated stone.  <0> What do you top your poizza with generally, what addional meats, vegetables, cheese, and condiments? <1> I prefer very little sauce, mozzarella with a dusting of parmesan, with pork or italian sausage. If my stomach feels up to the task, I add some diced green peppers & some onions.  
<0> I see a lot of work coming up at my job <1> How so? <0> My supervisor warned me earlier in the week about it <1> I'm sorry. Any way you can get out of it?
<0> I will start off saying I hate the water! I can't stand being in it; however,  that changed last week when I took my son to his first pool. His joy erased all my hatred for water.  <1> Aw. Children will make us do things we NEVER thought we would (or could) do! 
<0> That's great! Life is a lot less stressful that way. <1> In some societies adults have the highest regrets regarding choices of their education. That is crazy to me. <0> It makes sense, most make a decision at a young age that affects them for a large part of their lives. <1> I believe it is the toughest and most important decision to make. <0> There should be more guidance on the matter of choosing a career. I thought my decision was going to be irreversible.  <1> there are other options in life but you must always follow your heart when making such important decisions. <0> I disagree. Not everyone can be what they wish. Sometimes you have to follow your head, and even that doesn't always work out.  <1> I see your point.  It is a good one! <0> I myself changed the direction of my education multiple times. There were benefits but ultimately it was a mistake. 
<0> I cheated on a Spanish test in High school. <1> did you get caught <0> No, but I also didn't learn Spanish! <1> I did the same thing. It's too hard to learn at an older age. Especially when it's a mandatory school thing instead of an actual thing you WANT to learn. <0> And most highschool language teachers are utter garbage. The pace isn't fast enough and there's not enough immersion. <1> True, although I don't know about it not being fast enough. I think in my case it was too fast. Going from 'hola' to complex sentences in like two days

I really enjoy the color green, as well. It seems like such a friendly color most of the time <1> Speaking of the color red, it is iron oxide that gives the red color to the planet Mars <0> I did not know that. I hope that Earth does not end up like Mars <1> ALso our blood being colored red comes from the protein hemoglobin 
<0> Yes, I watched it all the time was I was a kid.  I loved Dino. <1> Were you aware that the Flintstones was the most financially successful network animated franchise for three decades, until "The Simpsons" debuted decades later. <0> no i did not know that. i do like homer simpson as well as bart. <1> What else do you like?

<0> I love pasta. It's a staple of traditional Italian cuisine. <1> i love pasta too <0> It's been around for around 1000 years, with the first reference dating to 1154 in Sicily. <1> that is a long time for pasta <0> There's a large variety of pasta, with 210 specific forms known. <1> i love spagetti the best of the pastas
<0> I guess it has to do with not being religious, but it's also that most of it really doesn't sound that good. <1> I can agree with you there I don't like all of the music I have a selective few some of it sounds like speaking rather then singing and some is just plain out hard to understand.  <0> myself i love religious music <1> I prefer country but I can listen to any kind of music. <0> country is on another level, i like listening too <1> I agree. Do you ever listen to classic country? <0> yes,mostly on weekends at home
<0> It was so fun! <1> What was so fun? <0> Taking my dog to the dog park!
<0> When I turned 25 I got my first surprise party thanks to my parents. <1> That's really cool of them. You weren't expecting it at all,  hu?

<0> I was walking around my office and someone spilled coffee on me <1> That is bad. What did you do after that? <0> I went to the bathroom to clean up,  it was a new shirt as well <1> Did he say sorry? <0> He did apologize afterwards and was genuinely hurt by it, so I let it slide.
<0> It's as the name suggest, a community theatre refers to a theatrical performance made in relation to particular community. <1> So I guess a bunch of volunteers make up it? Like a community entirely of professionals? <0> We have a few professionals, but most of us are amateurs with growing experience in theater. <1> Thats awesome, what kind of performance do you do? <0> Sometimes works by noted playwrights, but sometimes a historian in the community will bring a manuscript based on local events. <1> Oh that must be interesting, brining to life the history of your community. How long have you been doing it? <0> I just started with them a couple years ago.  School is so intense, it gave me a great outlet when I'm on break. 
<0> Whats your favorite color , do you like the color red  <1> Yes, I like the color red. But it's often associated with anger. <0> really , how so tell me more  <1> It's called color psychology. <0> sounds deep , i love all colors since im an artist my favorite color is orange  <1> that is an interesting color choice
<0> i went to disney world with my family last week which was nice. <1> I am so happy for you! <0> My grandkids are 4 & 6 and they LOVED it...but it was sooooooo  HOT <1> Glad you had a good time though, I haven't gotten around to taking my kids there yet, I hear there's a lot to do though <0> yes there is! something for all ages.  I love to travel :) <1> Me too! I used to travel all the time but it's gotten a bit harder to do with three kids <0> and expensive I am sure!  My daughter took care of most of the grand kids expenses ;) <1> Definitely, I don't know how I'd manage if I didn't have my husband's help. Sounds like she loves you very much <0> yes, we went to the bahamas too...for my other daughters wedding...been hitting those HOT places lately! lol
<0> I don't think I have ever tried it unless a friend had a toy with a breathing tube when I was a child at a pool or something. It sounds fun. <1> its pretty fun, if the water is really cold, people wear wetsuits to stay warm <0> sounds like a blast, i hope it goes well though. <1> its scary , but once you start to get the hang of it you'll like it. Definable an unreal experience. <0> i well definitly try it, how about thursday? <1> Well it's always right before Friday so that is always good! Do you travel a lot.  <0> yes i do, i'm heading to do surfing in Texas this weekwnd after the snorkeling on thrusday. <1> That sounds fancy. I like Texas, never been there though. I May visit soon myself I do have a sibling there.  <0> you'll love the food there, the Snorkeling is close to where i live. can't wait to do the Snorkeling with you this thrusday bud!

<0> I guess i'm not interested in a particular topic. I've just recently become curious and wanted to know more so your choice I guess. <1> I see! Well my favorite type is sports jornalism. They cover the world of sports and might work for a newspaper company! <0> Oh really? I use to be a newspaper reporter! I am retired now. But I really enjoyed the work. <1> What type of stories did you cover? <0> Mostly local things. The local highschool football games were my favorite thing to cover. <1> I think I would be fun to cover travel and exotic locations! <0> Yea, I dont like to travel much. I much prefer staying close to home. <1> I've always enjoy traveling.  My job as a chef has allowed me to move around a bit.  It's an adventure. <0> Oh what an interesting career! I dont enjoy cooking that much but I would love to taste your creations! Love to eat! <1> I don't like fussy stuff.  I like making the kinds of foods that make people happy.  What's your favorite food? <0> Oh I love Mexican dishes.
<0> i love country music and it was such a shock , he was only 50 <1> i love country music too . but hey this stuff happens <0> Yeah, at-least his music will still be around for us to listen!  <1> true, true. the great legends never really die! do you like old country mostly or the newer stuff? <0> I like the older stuff, Charlie Daniels is one of my favourite artists. What about yourself ? <1> I love the old, sad country music, Merle Haggard, Waylon Jennings. I'm not up on current music though. I usually listen to podcasts or audiobooks in the car  <0> What audio books are you listening to at the moment?  <1> I just finished Education: A Memoir and trying to decide what to listen to next. Do you like audiobooks?
<0> Hi. I have brown hair. <1> That's nice. Is it long or short hair? <0> I guess that depends on where you're from. Long hair is a concet thaat varies culturally. <1> That's true. I guess I would rephrase it as do you have shoulder length hair or longer? <0> It's about to my shoulders. I think most Americans would say medium. On a guy it would be "long." <1> My friend recently cut off 8 inches of hair to donate to cancer patients so I was curious about hair length.  <0>  Like, 40% of people get cancer, can you believe it? <1> WOW! That's higher than I thought. Do you think we'll ever have a cure?? <0> I wonder. A lot of people take shark cartilage, but there's no science supporting that as a treatment. <1> I actually knew that cancer patients are so many. It threatens me so much.
<0> I'm an old fashioned girl - I love rock and roll, especially 60s rock music. <1> What's your favorite music group/singer from that era? <0> I quite like Joan Jett & the Blackhearts, but I really love the Rolling Stones' music. <1> gosh, I didn't realize the Rolling Stones were from the 60's. I was thinking they were 70's! I wish we had old fashioned diners around still. I've always thought that era looked like such a fun time. <0> Unbelievable, isn't it?! The formed in London in 1962. I like old fashioned diners, too. <1> Were you born in the 60's? I was born in the 70's, so the 80's and 90's are more familiar eras for me.  <0> I was born in 1961 but still love the music. I really like the blues rhythm and the backbeat of the snare drum. <1> Do you play any musical instruments? My father was in a band in the 70's, but I don't have a musical bone in my body!
<0> Are you asking what year or which groups started rock and roll? <1> When rock and roll, the music style began in the 20th century <0> Honestly I don't really know.  <1> Blues is sometimes considered the precursor. Do you ever listen to blues? <0> Well you have Delta Blues, which I prefer actually. Some really good musicians.  <1> For sure. Who's your favorite? <0> Its hard to choose really. Not because I have a favorite but during that time they sang all the same songs. <1> Are you from the Delta? <0> I'm from all over. Military Brat! How bout you? <1> Georgia. Atlanta suburbs <0> Nice thats my area now! Small world. Love Georgia. Its beautiful here.
<0> My son is supposed to be sending me some money... <1> that is really nice of him,  how much time will you have to wait? <0> Hopefully not too much longer. I've been waiting for a few days now. <1> well i hope everything goes well at the bank and with the transaction <0> I hope so too.
<0> i couldnt believe how good my nephew is at little league <1> How old is he? <0> 8! <1> They are still cute at this age and they make a lot of progress.
<0> So I just bought plane tickets and book a hotel.  I am going to Vegas for the first time this fall! <1> im so excited for you, my friend has gone twice he said a lot of people are passed out drunk on the street , and even taco bell sells alcohol very weird place <0> That sounds like a lot of what I've heard. I ran into Jimmy Fallon the other day, and he was telling me the same kind of things! <1> Vegas is always a popular destination for vacation! <0> Definitely. It's got so much entertainment. Do you plan on going ever? <1> I want to go sometime next year <0> Great! Well I will give you the highlights of my trip and the things I enjoyed about it to give you some ideas! <1> Thank you that'll help me so much <0> Yeah no problem. My wife jokes that it is my last hurrah before I go bald. <1> Haha that's a great joke <0> I really just can't wait to do some gambling! <1> hahah I hope you don't spend too much time gambling. Don't want to come home broke.
<0> well, not all of them are venomous <1> That's true. Spiders are found worldwide, except in Antarctica. Where are dangerous snakes found? <0> ugh spiders. can we not talk about those <1> Sure!  I don't really like them either.  I hate it when I walk through a spider web.  I'm on the tall side so it happens often. <0> every time i see a web i freak and search the whole house the idea that ones hiding is just. UGH  <1> You're really afraid, aren't you?  Is it a phobia?  I know people have those. <0> haha i guess its something like that.  <1> You should try immersion therapy or something.  I would like to try immersion therapy to treat my food addiction, LOL!
<0> yea its so tasty with all the spices and stuff. <1> The herbs and spices are what make the food so damn good. <0> Food without having any added just tastes nasty to me, and disappoints me like my life sometimes. <1> I like lots of flavor too. I recently discovered Indian food and I love the spiciness of it.  <0> I couldn't eat spicy food, as that would tear my stomach up too much. <1> I just tried it recently and I love it! Certainly wouldnt give scaps to a pet though.  <0> Yes alot of herbs and spicys could make a pet very sick, reminds me that I wish I could be a animal sometimes. <1> Well I hate all spices though.
<0> One time I saw a giant cockroach under my desk! <1> omg! I hate cockroaches,  they are ugly insects  <0> Yes! they are so creepy with how fast and nasty they are1 <1> were you able to kill it? what did you do? <0> I sprayed it with Raid <1> thats good.. i too do the same only
<0> I'm going skydiving this weekend. My stomach all ready hurts with fear. <1> Don't worry you'll be fine.  It's safe. <0> This is my 3rd time and I'm still scared
<0> I just upgraded the turbo on my car. I wanted more power but currently my VW can beat a corvette in a race. So I'm happy <1> That is very cool! How much did it cost? <0> I did all the work my self but the parts were around 4500 besides the price off the all work I've all ready done to it. I'm trying to build a grocery getter that I can take to the race track.
<0> I just got a bunch of bills in. <1> That is never a good feeling <0> It's not! Especially as I'm saving up for plane tickets <1> Go get booking you know you want to ;) <0> Yeah I can't wait. Learning about different cultures is my passion. What about you? <1> Love for country <0> Oh, nice. I'm a veteran so I'm super patriotic <1> military veteran that travels and discovers new cultures <0> yep that's me in a nutshell. Love my country, love to learn about other ones <1> I wish one day I would be able to serve my country along those brave man and woman who are serving to protect our country
<0> I was busy with a work related project <1> Oh? What kind of project?
<0> Do you know why 6 was afraid of 7? BECAUSE 7 8 9! <1> Haha  One of my favorite jokes, any more? <0> More jokes about arabic numerals such as the number 7? No, I'm afraid that's all I have at the moment. <1> Are you from Arabia? <0> No, I am not
<0> Do you feel anything like that <1> Like what? Bad or miserable? <0> sad,  when you see beggar in the street

<0> I compete in the Highland games around the country. I just got a new kilt and I look amazing.  <1> I am bad at every game. <0> It's a little different. It's based in picking up and throwing objects like logs,  hammers that weight 70 pounds and stones that weight 70 pounds. Being Scottish it keeps me feeling at home.
<0> Hi, i really like to have a cold shower  <1> What is it that you like about cold showers? <0> rather than indoor or man made, i love to have shower under waterfalls <1> Interesting! Do you use soap when you shower under a waterfall? <0> well,people reproduce natural phenomena by pouring jugs of water which is cold after washing. <1> I kind of find it weird to shower under a waterfall

Have you ever been to Paris before? <1> I have never been to Paris.

I am putting aside some vacation money to do that with my husband. <0> I never been to Paris before but my folks visited Paris and said it is very very expensive. <1> Quite expensive, that is why I have to save my money for a few years before taking that trip.

<0> I have heard of him, but bot sure who he is. <1> He has published two books and nineteen novels. I'm sure you've seen some of his movies. <0> I am not a huge movie buff. I watch a lot of stand up comedy though. <1> Oh me too! I'm actually going to a show on friday. <0> What show? <1> Dusty Slay <0> I will have to check them out <1> He's been on Jimmy Kimmel a lot.  <0> I'll look him up. Have you heard of Iliza Sherslinger? <1> Yeah! I saw her in Nashville.
<0> I'm going to cut to the chase here. Just blurt it on. My DRESS blew up in front of parents and children the other day when it was windy. <1> That must have been a very windy day! <0> I wanted to run and hide.  I haven't' worn a dress since.  
<0> I can't go more than a day and a half without taking a shower. Thank goodness for nature giving us the idea for showers, through waterfalls! <1> When did we make the first shower? <0> The ancient greeks are the earlier known "modern type" shower users. before that it was pouring buckets on your head LOL. <1> What are modern showers usually made of? <0> Besides the shower head that sprays water. The real MVP of showers are the aqueducts and sewage systems leading back to the greeks that I mentioned above. The pipes (lead in the greek days) that pump water in and out to the shower are really what make the shower possible  <1> It seems that the Greeks really pushed the shower forward into the future.
<0> Well last week my husband and I celebrated our 10th wedding anniversary. <1> Congrats! I'm sure you will have great memories.  <0> We do.  10 years being loyal and true to each.  I just hope we have many more! <1> I believe you will just continue doing what you've already done. <0> thats true.  Are you married yet yourself? <1> Yes I am married <0> I hope you are as happy as I am.  Its nots easy though,  a work in progress,  but worth it all in the long run. <1> I hope so. I just got married last month. Do you have any advice for a long happy marriage?
<0> Do you have brown hair? I have super dark brown hair, its really long too. <1> Me too I have brown hair it is the second most popular color, the first is black. <0> when i was a little girl, i had blonde natural highlights through my hair. now its just brown with some grey streaks haha <1> The color is due to pigment eumelamin, the more eumelamin there is, the color will be darker.  <0> ive always wondered about what casues the color change! Do you know any other interesting facts about hair? <1> There is more hair one the head of people of darker hair color. 
<0> I love taking showers! I do not know how I would live without the modern showers. In ancient times people would pour jugs of cold water over themselves and consider that a shower <1> It would be like living in the stone age.  WHen were showers first invented? <0> Well that is hard to determine because original showers were neither indoor structures of man-made, they were actually formed by natural things in nature such as waterfalls.  <1> When did modern showers become common <0> The Ancient Greeks were actually the first people to take showers, but the date is unknown. <1> Really?  So before that everyone took baths 
<0> My family went to the zoo last weekend when the weather channel said it would be mostly a nice day. We are all fairly smart so just incase we brought unbrellas should the sky spontaneously fall on us. At one point it did, and we were not some of the many folks who were without umbrellas! <1> What made you suspect that it might rain? <0> I just had a gut feeling. I have been trapped without an umbrella before when the weather channel didn't predict any rain. <1> Sorry to hear that. Hope the weather is better next time! <0> Me too! The zoo is so much better when it is sunny.  <1> Yes and a lot more fun with out rain  <0> What is your favorite zoo animal?
<0> My grandmother just died a few months ago from cancer.  <1> Oh, I'm so sorry. How old was she? <0> She was 90. I dislike winter always reminds me of her. <1> I'm sorry. At least she isn't suffering anymore. <0> true. at least work will keep me busy, Im an electrician. what about you? <1> Im just a writer now <0> thats great. what do you write? <1> poetry i'm a bit of a sap <0> cool! i wish i could write. I do enjoy reading though
<0> I went to take the trash out last night and there was a stray dog in my driveway. <1> Oh no.  Was the dog friendly? <0> It was. I gave it some water and checked to see if it had a collar.  <1> That is nice of you... I have a pet dog and I would hope that someone would do that and call me. <0> it should be the normal thing to do.
<0> Being a parent so far has not been anywhere near as difficult as I expected it to be. My daughter is awesome! <1> That is great to hear that things are going well for you.
<0> When my son was born it felt like I had everything I needed in life. <1> I bet that was a wonderful day
<0> i am hoping to win the lottery this week <1> That would be a dream <0> If I do win, I may have to share the winnings with my Reddit family as I post there a lot. <1> Yeah, people do like impulse spending that comes with wagering money. <0> And honestly, that would be me. I'd have to buy a new car that was blue because I LOVE the color blue. <1> Thats good, i allso love blue cars, is blue your favorite color?

<0> Man I couldn't get any sleep last night. <1> Were you worried about something? What was keeping you up? <0> There was something scratching on my window.  I was pretty nervous.
<0> My guinea pig was feeling very sick but I was able to nurse her back to health. <1> Did you do some neat doctor stuff on it? <0> No,  I hate giving chemical medicine to my animals. I just kept her on a heating blanket and gave her lots of fresh veggies. She is alright now! <1> Oh yea that sounds like you did a good job! <0> Hopefully I did, she seems fine but I'm no professional!
<0> Yes he was, he was an amazing singer! <1> Yes. His names are Prince Rogers Nelson <0> Prince was my favorite artist of all time. Purple Rain is my anthem. <1> i love his songs and also drawing <0> You are an artist? What do you draw? <1> mostly comics! what are you into <0> I'm studying to be a linguist. I'm fluent in English and Spanish, and working on French, Russian, and Italian. <1> thats very impressive, I wish i could speak more language! I put my efforts into drawing <0> What kind of comics do you draw?
<0> If I hit the lotto I think I will go buy me an Italian sports car I'm thinking a Ferrari.  <1> Yes! Haha what a great thought! Ferraris are neat, when were they invented? <0> They have been around for years they was first founded in 1939 by Enzo Ferrari.  <1> Amazing! They have become a popular brand since then. Are the cars popular around the world? <0> Yes they are very popular they was rated the world's most powerful brand they are really expensive cars though.  <1> Yeah they are incredible slick vehicles. I wish I could afford one! Have their cars been evolving with new technology? <0> Not at the moment I did hear that they are working to make them plug in electric vehicles where they can be safe driven in the United States if it can be supported by the federal government.  <1> Nice! I am thinking of buying one soon. 
<0> Becasue of a certain person who worked at the corner grocery I became uneasy to shop there. <1> I am so sorry to hear that. What did they do to make you feel uncomfortable going there? <0> They were a friend and customer of mine in a small business and cheated me out of a large sum of money. <1> That's the worst! You think you can trust people,  and then they stab you in the back. I don't blame you for not wanting to see them again. <0> i can still made a better relationship with them if i made a very good use of the huge sum of money given me
<0> that is nice . is it very long ? <1> i hope you have the time of your life <0> yes i have lot of time  <1> lol, what do you like doing in your spare time? I reside on a ranch, so naturally a love of the outdoors comes natural. <0> i like to play with my pet then go to zoo my favorite animal is zebra <1> I love animals too! I have a dog and if I were to pick a favorite animal it would be polar bear or penguin. <0> okay nice. <1> I love zebras also. There is a farm near me that has a zebra that always comes to the fence for petting when it sees me. <0> do you know i am a girl  <1> I didn't know that. I am a male.  <0> i know  <1> ok, it is cool
<0> my favorite color is red  <1> Very nice. It's a strong color to pick to be infatuated with, as it's a primary color in the RGB color model and the CMYK color model. Little do people know, though, is that it's a complementary color of cyan <0> oh that i did not know, anything else you can tell me about the color red ? <1> It's one of the colors that's at the end of the visible spectrum of light, sitting right next to orange, and opposite of violet. Its wavelength is dominant, with nanometres of 625 to 740. So, it's obviously a strong color, which is why some people like it. <0> do you see the color red in nature a lot ? <1> Well, for example, you'll see red in the sky at times due to the Rayleigh scattering, and you'll see red in the Grand Canyon and other geological features because of hematite or red ochre, which come from iron oxide. These are just a couple of examples, but red is very present in nature.
<0> how are you this evening ? <1> good . just relaxing after a long day of gardening . you ? <0> i have been working out . i like staying in shape . <1> i do too . i do a lot of outdoor walking . <0> i like wearing skinny jeans so it is important to me to stay fit . <1> understandable . i have a dog . do you have any pets ? <0> i have a cat . she likes to curl up on my band shirts . <1> Aww, that's so cute! I love cats.
<0> Do you ever bake? The method for cooking food with dry heat. <1> I've always been curious. After burning one too many batches of simple cookies I tend to shy away from the oven. <0> You can also barbecue in the oven. <1> Really? I have always envisioned barbecues as being outside, accompanied by a roaring flame and copious amounts of alcohol.  <0> I really love these those kind of things
<0> hello , how are you on this wonderful day <1> i'm good and you ? <0> great , what is your favorite color ? <1> my favorite color is blue . do you have a favorite character ? <0> i like red , like fire truck <1> my favorite character is mickey mouse . <0> oh , mickey is my sisters stage name , she's a pole dancer <1> every year i would love to go to disney world with my family . <0> i go there a lot with my church , it is a christian church <1> i love frozen so i love to sing the songs from the movie . <0> oh that's nice , i'm more into classical music <1> yes well i love disney musicals .
<0> So I lost 20 lbs onmy diet and last night I ate a whole large pizza! <1> Wow! Well a cheat day here and there might be okay! Haha <0> I agree. I feel bad for doing so! <1> Right,  but I'd say once isn't too bad as long you stay on track. <0> At least it was a tasty pizza.
<0> What training do you need? <1> A lot of it is about having a high visibility presence so that people don't even TRY any crap with you! You want to always be on the lookout for signs of crime.... <0> That makes sense. Vigilance is a great preventative.  <1> I am a security guard so it is very important. <0> Are you concerned that you are going to be replaced with a security robot? I listened to a great 99% Invisible about them plus a documentary called Chopping Mall. <1> I have never thought of that. I just finished training so I should be ok for a few years. <0> Yes, it should take a while for the robots to be ready to work.
<0> My son came back from a camping trip last night. I was great to have him safely home again.  <1> I'm glad he returned home safe and sound. Did he have fun on the camping trip? <0> He did. I'm a worrier,  but I need to learn to let go more.  <1> My mom was the same way. It's all part of being a parent. I hope to have kids soon too and I worry about stuff concerning them myself! <0> Yes as a mother you always worry no matter how old they get.
<0> I have become interested in watersports.  Do you like it? <1> I do like some of them, but I know there are many. What kind do you like? <0> I was thinking about wakeboarding or kayaking.  Which would you recommend? <1> I don't know much about the water sport of wakeboarding, but I do like to canoe. I think that's similar to kayaking.  <0> Is it expesive to buy a canoe?  Is it hard to do? <1> I didn't think it was hard to canoe, it's a pretty easy and relaxing water sport. It actually is an Olympic sport too, first started in 1924  <0> Wow!  I didn't know it was an Olympic sport.  Is it still? <1> I believe it still is. A fun competitive water sport is boat racing. I think that would be really fun to do!
<0> I worked for weeks on a presentation for work. I practiced over and over. I felt relaxed the morning of. <1> That's good! That probably means you worked on it until it became something you're proud of.
<0> Wow, I'm still on dialup!  It's so darned slow!  I bet you can get more done with the faster speed! <1> Well access to the internet was once rare, but it has grown rapidly over the years.  Exponentially even. <0> If you can afford it. <1> The price is coming down, though.. and that will continue thanks to thinks like Project Loon and Elon Musk's Cubesats. <0> Never heard of those. But I don't get out much. <1> I understand.  Do you ever play chess? <0> No. I'm not around people much. My dog is my only friend. <1> Awww, its ok though.. you can even play chess online, even through dial up.. (heck, people used to play it by mail) <0> Yes i will, i get around people so much, so i can play games easilly
<0> I have brown hair. What about you? <1> I have brown hair and I know a lot about it <0> What do you know? <1> Brown hair is the second most common hair colour just behind black hair <0> Oh really? I didn't know black hair was that common. I guess maybe in Asia. <1> Actually brown hair is common in the Western world such as Central Europe, Southeastern Europe, Eastern Europe, Southern Europe, Southern Cone, the United States, and also some populations in the Greater Middle East where it transitions smoothly into black hair. <0> Interesting. I guess I don't see too much black hair where I live. <1> Also, Australian Aborigines and Melanesians hair is normally brown.
<0> I got caught in a huge rainstorm last week. It was a deludge.  <1> Aww man,  I hope you brought your raincoat. <0> Thankfully I had remembered to put an umbrella in my bag before I left the house.  <1> That's good,  you don't want to get soaked and catch a cold. <0> I really can't afford to be sick now.

Didn't feel like eating lunch after that <1> Oh my gosh that's disgusting!!! I hate when there are flying things buzzing around Soo annoying <0> Yeah, I was not able to get any work done with it flying around. <1> My dogs four dogs are good at spotting them and trying to catch them flying around, it's pretty funny. <0> I bet.  That's a lot of dogs to keep fed, what kind of dogs are they? <1> The are all Golden Retrievers. What can I say? I love the breed. If I could spend all my time with my dogs I would. <0> That is a great breed.  How many bags of dog food to you go through a month? <1> Usually we go through about three huge bags. I give them human food as well, bad habit I know. <0> I bet they love it though.  Do they like eggs?
<0> I love the colour red. Its so vibrant. <1> I do too. It really pops! <0> We couldnt have any cool RGB things in our computers without it. Its one of the primary colors. <1> What does it mean to be a primary color? <0> It means that with the use of combination of those 3 colors you can make almost any color. Red sits at the end of the spectrum, close to orange, but opposite of violet. <1> Oh ok, I understand. What are the other primary colors? <0> Green and blue make up the other two colors of the RGB color model. <1> Oh really? I always though it was yellow. <0> red and green, RGB colors, mixed together make up yellow

I guess if it works for you,  then don't change anything. <0> I don't need to change anything because I'm such an extrovert already.

<0> I would love to start horseback riding. I have no idea what it entails though. <1> That's interesting, animals in sport are considered working animals. <0> I would be fun, but now I'm worried it's not good for the horse since it's considered work for them. <1> I see what you mean. Some working animals are called draft animals or beats of burden. <0> I don't like the sound of beats of burden. What does that mean? <1> Sorry I meant beasts of burden. It basically means animals trained to provide a tractive force.
<0> I have brown hair. <1> It has a categorized as higher levels of the dark pigment eumelanin and lower levels of the pale pigment pheomelanin <0> I wonder why brown or darker color hairs are more common than blond or red hair. <1> blond" is first documented in English in 1481 and derives from Old French "blund, blont", meaning "a colour midway between golden  <0> So records show that blond hair didn't exist before? Do you think it's possible for new hair colors to naturally start existing then? <1> Yes. Do you know that People with brown hair are often referred to as brunette,

Do you feel that even with his actions, the media is being hyperbolic towards him.
<0> My boyfriend proposed to me,  and I accepted! I thought he didn't want to get married so it was a welcome surprise. <1> Wow,  congratulations! Have you guys set a date yet? <0> Thank you!

<0> My favorite color is red. What is yours? <1> Pink is my favorite, you may have not known but it's considered a pale red. <0> That is true! Pink is indeed a shade of red. I guess if I were specific, I'd say my favorite color is "blood" red.  <1> Blood red is a pretty nice color of red, I prefer the darker reds like crimson as well. <0> Me as well, I love darker colored reds. Speaking of which, do you enjoy red wines? <1> Red wines are pretty nice, I can be a little picky with them at times though. <0> I agree, it seems you have to be in the right mood to enjoy some red wines.  <1> I like to match them to my meals when I go out.
<0> Dangit!  They burned!! <1> Are you baking? What did you burn. <0> My brownies! Ugh, the kitchen smells horrible now haha <1> Oh no! Do you burn foods often? <0> No, hardly ever! I'm a great cook but not the best at baking. Maybe I should just stick to writing. Aspiring journalist here <1> Very lucrative career. What do you write about? <0> Generally politics. I am fascinated by what motivates politicians to do the outlandish things they do. <1> I'm more of a fan of the past than the present. I like the Victorian era. <0> My mom is a librarian, I grew up in a home that was more focused on fiction and the past. I'm more interested in here and now <1> My mom owned a doll store. I collect them now. My favorite is a doll that looks like Queen Victoria. <0> They are not focused to libation not interested now
<0> Have you ever been to Niagara Falls? It is such an awesome sight to behold. <1> I've never been to Niagara Falls but I've always wanted to go.

I would most certainly see the falls first and make sure that you take a picture.  <1> Is there a good place I should take a picture from? <0> There are many places you can take a picture. There are a few lookout points. There is also a casino if you like gambling. <1> I do enjoy a bit of gambling. I like playing craps and the slots. How about you? <0> I love playing slots. I love playing the slots in Vegas. The slots have a good payout and great incentives at some of the casinos. <1> I'd love to go to Vegas! I'd hit the penny slots and try to get free drinks all night. I go to Atlantic City quite often. Have you ever been?
<0> I once had a fluffy cat named Leo,  but he got lymphoma and I had to have him put to sleep. <1> Oh,  I am so sorry. It has to be the most difficult thing to have to do. I had to do that with my gorgeous lab - I still miss him! <0> I'm sorry to hear about your lab as well. They are very sweet dogs. <1> Indeed they are. And so are many cats - the farm I used to live on has a ginger tom. He's quite the character and used to visit me regularly! <0> I love ginger cats! Leo was a ginger,  and I have one right now named Chunk. <1> This fella is called Oliver. He's a big old softie who is ace at catching gophers. He would bring half eaten ones to my door! <0> Yikes! That doesn't sound pleasant,  but I know they do that to try to show you they like you. They think you appreciate the gifts. <1> Yeah I just have to say thanks and get rid of them, one of the perks of having cats, I guess, right?
<0> Have you ever been to the zoo just to realize that animals can be just as good as humans? <1> I do enjoy the zoo and the animals. I think they could be just as good. <0> Yes,  I am happy somebody shares this with me. <1> I think it's a good outlook. <0> Do you have any pets?

<0> How far will you descend? <1> Not sure, but it involves free-falling before the parachute has been deployed. <0> Sounds really scary, not sure if I want to try it. <1> I like to take a risk every once in a while. I'll take my chances. My friends think I'm crazy but I think it's great. <0> Do you think I should try it one day? <1> Of course you have to be a little daring you could do it all you have to do is go for it. Take some friends also. <0> I think i will try it, thank you.
<0> i guess we have an age difference . i'm and i've 2 children . <1> i'm 57 and my three children are in their thirties now . <0> I do lifestyle blogging as a hobby and really love shopping. What are some of your hobbies? <1> i like to blog and post funny memes to encourage healthy eating habits. my little ones are 2 and 4. <0> Sounds like we have a lot in common then. That is what I focus mostly on with blogging also, with a touch of the outdoors for healing. <1> oh. the healing part is fun.  my favorite memes are about herbs. <0> Natural healing is easily overlooked and something people should focus on more if you ask me! <1> i agree.  it is good protective maintenance. <0> Anything else you like blogging about? <1> gardening.  i am a newbie at gardening. <0> I love gardening. I feel I can improve a lot, but I already am known for having a green thumb, especially for trees. <1> the garden is big and has many herbs plant around 
<0> My brother and his friends invited me to a party tonight. <1> Sounds like that could be fun if you like your brother and if you like parties. Do you want to go? <0> I just came back from it!

I'm glad you were able to have fun and be surrounded by those that love you. <0> Thank you, I didnt have very much fun.
<0> I had my hair professionally colored to purple. Have you ever considered coloring your hair? <1> Wow that's definitely cool! I think hair dye is definitely a great way to express yourself! Whenever I was younger I colored my hair blond! <0> That's great! Hair coloring actually goes back far in history, a Greek historian Diodorus Siculus even mentioned how the Celtics dyed their hair blonde. <1> Wow, I had no idea, that's pretty cool. How old were you when you decided you wanted to dye it and how old were you when you actually ended up doing it? <0> Well I was 22 when I wanted to do it, and then I waited until I was 23, so not very long. <1> Well that's awesome, it's cool you actually did it. How has the overall reaction from people been since you've colored it? <0> They were quite supportive actually. I think it's become more popular, I heard that 75% of women in Copenhagen have reported using hair dye. <1> lucky you. I had to fight before my people were cool with it.
<0> This couple just moved into my building and have been having loud parties almost every night! <1> That sounds awful! <0> Yeah,  it's really irritating. I don't mind people having fun but come on,  every single night? It's really ticking me off.

I do love Cheetos, though.   <0> Cheetos are good!  I'm not a big fan of vegetables.  If I had to choose, I would say green beans are my favorite.   <1> I like green beans, too.  Especially when they're just picked.  How do you like to cook them? <0> I like them best baked or using the air fryer.  Have you every used an air fryer?  <1> No, but I'm interested in them.  Are they really healthier than deep frying? <0> I think the food tastes just as good if not better.  They have to be healthier, since no oil is used.   <1> That makes sense =)  I want to eat healthy, but do indulge in fried food sometimes - this could help that. <0> Yes it could.  I love using mine.  I have cooked many meals in it.  Pork chops are my favorite in the air fryer.   <1> Oh wow, that sounds SO good.  I wonder if I could make fries out of carrots in it...?  Dip 'em in ranch ;)
<0> I have brown hair, my sister says it is the second most common hair in the world <1> i have blackish hair <0> Most brown hair can vary to a black or dark brown sometimes. <1> so what is the most common hair color, black? <0> Yup! and people with brown hair are often referred to as brunettes. <1> what makes the color of hair? <0> It is the pigmentation in the hair.

My favorite is pecan <1> I like pecan, but I usually only have it around Thanksgiving. <0> Same here, and Christmas time as well. <1> The time between Thanksgiving and Christmas is my favorite part of the year.  <0> I love spring time the best, when everything is coming back to life.
<0> I really love being in the great outdoors with my family! <1> Oh yea? Where are you guys? In the mountains? Camping? <0> We went camping,  yes.  We're in the Midwest,  so no mountains,  unfortunately.  But we were near a lake. <1> Lakes are awesome. A body of water around here is pretty far. How long are you guys staying?
<0> Have you had much experience with twins. <1> I know several twins, which are two offspring produced from the same pregnancy. <0> Yes, any idea how commmon they are? <1> It just depends on the area and genetics. Twins are either identical or fraternal. <0> What is a fraternal twin mean? <1> Fraternal twins are two eggs fertilized by sperm, where identical is only one zygote that splits. <0> Cool, that's good to know.

<0> In front of everyone my friend jumped off the lunch table and did a backflip. <1> That's an interesting way to get attention. What spurred that on? Was it a dare, or was he just feeling wild? <0> He is just crazy! I think someone dared him. <1> Interesting.. Did he get in trouble? Was this at a high school or something? And does he take gymnastics?! Back flips are hard! <0> It was at work at a family business. He probably will not be in trouble. <1> Oh, I thought it was at school.  How old was he? <0> He's 22. He's a crazy good athlete and likes to show off.
<0> By today's standards I am not physically fit.  I like the definition of the industrial revolution: ability to carry out the day's activities without undue fatigue.   <1> That is crazy I guess I am not fit either but I just got a gym membership <0> Today the definition includes proper nutrition and sufficient rest as well.  I eat right, but I don't sleep!  <1> Oh I am the same way! I eat really healthy but I have sleeping problems! What other standards are there? <0> Well, your gym membership is good, because there is a relation between fitness and attractiveness that caused gyms to spring up in the last 30 years. <1> Oh I guess I haven't thought of how recently popular they have become. Have you tried crossfit? <0> I haven't, because I thought it was Olympic weightlifting?  I'm more of a Zumba gal. <1> Oh okay I see! My best friend teaches zumba I went to her classes to support, it is so hard <0> It IS hard!  The squats and lunges burn my legs!
<0>  I spilled water all over myself at school and it looked like a peed on myself! ugh  <1> Oh geez! That would suck! I hope it wasn't a cold day? Could you drive home and get new clothes? <0> No I just let it dry, It was only water to it wasnt smelly or anything <1> Thank goodness!  I sat on chocolate once when I was in middle school and I was wearing white! <0> Oh no, that just cant dry out <1> No not at all.  I had to wear my sweatshirt around my waist all day so that saved me hahaha! <0> Thats good though. Im sure not very many people even noticed <1> Not too many.  Only a few friends but we had a good laugh! <0> Haha childhood memories are always fun to look back o0n <1> Yes, especially the ones where you wanted to crawl in hole.  Where did you grow up?
<0> My son wouldnt sleep last night.  He kept yelling and wouldnt go into his room. <1> Oh no! I hate when that happens. Was he afraid or just didn't want to sleep?
<0> i cant believe the news i just got . my sister is a stripper <1> sounds like my kids ! ha . . stay at home dad here , have to laugh somewhere . <0> we grew up christian so its out of character . <1> i bet i am sorry . it is an interesting job choice . <0> what do you do for work ? <1> i stay home with kids now , prior was in human services . <0> what does human services mean ? <1> i helped families to learn how to live together basically ! <0> my family may need that soon . <1> oh no . is your life a horror movie ? i love those ! <0> no but my favorite color is blood red . <1> ohhhh yikes ! that can be purchased at home depot . my dad used to work there .
<0> Last year I hardly could hide my impatience to go on vacation. <1> I bet! Did it turn out nice? <0> Yes,  I had a good time. <1> That's good... I can't wait for my vacation! <0> Where are you going on vacation?
<0> sometimes i get scared because i fear not being able to achieve my goals in life <1> I feel you. I am still scared even though I am sort of successful now!
<0> Good evening, have you ever been to a circus and encountered a comic performer such as a clown? <1> Yes indeed! Gotta say -- I'm not a big fan. There's something a bit creepy about them. How about you? <0> I completely agree.  The older that I get, the more afraid of them I become.  One group of clowns that I find frightening is the group Insane Clown Posse.  Have you heard of them?  <1> Aren't they more of a music group? But, yes -- point taken! I know their fans, the Juggalos, dress up in clown-like makeup. I think more of clowns like Steven King's "It"! <0> That's true, they are a music group.  Juggalos are freaky along with the movie IT.  I can't believe that people were dressing up like evil clowns back in 2016 and hiding near schools.  Wouldn't that be freaky to encounter one at night? <1> Totally agree. I'm not sure what would motivate people to do the evil clown dress up -- I guess the thrill of spooking people. Not funny! Did you see IT? <0> I did see IT.  I think I remember seeing it on TV right when it came out in 1986. That movie still freaks me out to this day.  I haven't seen the new version yet.  Have you? <1> NO! And I forgot about the original. Stephen King is a master at what he does. And I did notice that IT is now on HBO. So if you want to rewatch it.....ha!
<0> I always feel like myself from the past when I drive my old truck. <1> Sounds like a good time.  What kind of truck is it? <0> Its and old Ford.   Where are you from? <1> I'm from Germany. What about you? <0> I'm from Mississippi.  I bet Germany is beautiful.  Do they have good food?  I love to cook. <1> The food is okay.  I do not enjoy cooking, I prefer eating. <0> I like that part the most.  Hows the weather there? <1> Not too bad. It is cold and rainy. I enjoy the weather <0> I love the snow.  I wish we had cooler weather here. 
<0> Hi, I really enjoy baking. My favorite things to bake are cookies, brownies and cake. How about you? <1> I am not a baker but wish I could make the most common baked item that I believe is bread. <0> I've never baked bread,but would like to try. That would be a very useful skill.  <1> I wouldn't imagine it is too difficult since bread is prepared from a dough of flour and water.   <0> You're right. I enjoy the sweet treats best though. I like the way they make my kitchen smell and watching others enjoy them.  <1> I bet your kitchen smells wonderful!  You could certainly call yourself a baker since you prepare all the yummy baked goods!
<0> I believe that they share common traits with anteaters and sloths. <1> Interesting. The name Armadillo comes from the Spanish word meaning "little armored one" fittingly enough. <0> That is great maybe I should tell my son <1> You should definitely consider it.  They are good with kids, but keep in mind, they typically have a thick coat that sheds frequently. <0> Armilldillos are like wart hogs and an cross between ant eaters. <1> Like those scrawny penguins? That would make me want to bench press a polar bear. ! <0> I love animals but raw power of watching them chase people.. and the hype
<0> I really feel nostalgic around christmas <1> really? well,  who doesnt! <0> true.. there is something about that holiday that makes us wanna be kids again <1> i actually feel like a kid even now during christmas <0> It's great now that I get to watch my own kids on Christmas
<0> great to hunt i love it <1> So you can use it for hunting? Is the Bowie knife good for anything else? <0> I've only ever used it for hunting <1> That's really cool. I know how much my husbands pocket knives mean to him. <0> My father has a pocket knife that he inherited from my great grandfather. Are any of your husband's knives family heirlooms? <1> Yes, It goes with the rest of the stuff.    It's a rifle he hunted with, and my father hunted with.  Now I've got it. <0> How neat. What's your favorite type of hunting? <1> I'm an outdoorsman.  I hunt or fish for half of the meat I eat each year. <0> I don't like hunting.
<0> I moved to tornado alley a few years ago. I'm not used to large tornadoes so I was pretty scared when it started storming. <1> Oh man,  I can't even imagine. I lived in Kansas for a while and we had a storm that did a lot of damage. Took out the power all day and stuff. Nature can be so devastating sometimes. <0> We aren't too far south of Kansas in Oklahoma. We have had to spend a few evenings in the storm shelter. I guess stuff can be replaced.  <1> Jeeeze,  yea,  it's totally understandable to be afraid. Has it been good there otherwise? <0> I love it here,  except for the tornadoes and snakes.  <1> I can imagine. Tornado scare me to death
<0> I like red color <1> They say one can get that color in mars because of  iron oxide  <0> I am not too sure of that but I would say I love red cars and roses <1> my first car was a toyota camry and the red made it stand out everywhere I go. red is good on metallic surfaces ;) <0> i like red toyota camry sport versions  <1> Awesome, I wonder what it will be like if there was no red in the rainbow or there is no red sky at sunset :)
<0> Sobriety is an issue that is difficult for many individuals. <1> Wold you like to know the definition of sobriety? <0> Yes, please tell me the definition. <1> the condition of not having effects from alcohol. It is the state of being sober. <0> Yes, I believe that staying sober is difficult for many people. <1> I read that it is natural state of a human being given at a birth. I do not quite agree with that statement. <0> I was married to an alcoholic who struggled with staying sober for almost 20 years. Even after rehab, he still struggles. <1> That is a difficult situation to be in. 
<0> hello there ! how are you doing today ? <1> just jamming out to some new kids on the block ! ! <0> oh my ! i'm just enjoying a new coloring book after a hectic evening . <1> how sweet ! ! i need to get my dance gear ready for my class tomorrow night !
<0> Do you feel devastated right now? <1> No. I feel fine,  if a little tired. Do you? <0> Yeah me too. I kind of do due to lack of sleep.  <1> Are you based in the US? Is it not about 2 am over there? <0> I'm out on the East coast.
<0> I love fast cars which is why I bought a Ferrari. <1> Yeah Ferrari is my favorite sports car manufacturer in Maranello <0> I wonder how much the very first Ferrari cost to buy. <1> I'm not sure, but I do know that Enzo Ferrari wasn't initially interested in producing road cars back when he formed Scuderia Ferraria in 1929 <0> I didn't know that, do you know when they made the first model? <1> I know that Ferrari didn't start producing sports cars until 1947, 18 years after the Scuderia Ferrari racing team was formed! <0> Wow it sounds like you really know a lot about Ferrari

<0> I have a family member struggling with the medical condition obesity. <1> Sorry to here that. What can be done to help them? <0> Well to help with obesity, you can make changes to your diet. You can exercise more. <1> What exactly is obesity? <0> Obesity is when there is excess body fat that is results in a negative effect on ones health. <1> Is this a common thing.  I see a lot of fat people around but not sure if it is medical. <0> Its somewhat common. The most common casues of obesity is a combination of lack of physical activity, excessive food intake, and genetics. <1> By the way I'm fat too.  Should I see a doctor about this obesity thing? <0> Yes, the doctor can give you advice on how to lose weight.
<0> I tried java, but it was too tedious. What other programs do you use? <1> Pretty much only Java.  Have you tried Sencha Touch? <0> No i haven't. What is it about? <1> It helps you create JavaScript applications. We use it at the school where I'm a teacher. <0> I enjoy creating websites but havent heard about it <1> It is pretty easy to use, you should look into it! Do you create websites for work? <0> No, I do them for myself <1> Oh, nice! I've been wanting to build my own website, but I've been going through a hard time and it's taking all my energy.
<0> I would love to visit Niagara Falls. Have you ever seen it in person before? <1> Have you ever been to Niagra Falls, either the Canadian side, or the American side? <0> No, I have a friend that lives nearby though that I've been meaning to visit. He just said that it is really breathtaking. <1> I live in Buffalo, so it is very close by, and I have hiked the Niagara Gorge, and seen all the falls. <0> Yes, my friend has done the Niagara tour many times. The America Falls look so huge! <1> There are three falls, and the Horseshoe Falls is the biggest.  For the best views you should visit both sides of the river.
<0> Target is my favorite store because of its cheap and chic products.  What is yours? <1> I like Target, it is sort of pricey though, so I would say Walmart because of the pricing! <0> Target is the second largest corporation, behind Walmart.   <1> that is not a surprise with the fall of Kmart recently, target seems to be the new preference of many people <0> Kmart's peak was in 2000, and it operated 2171 stores.  Their fall from grace did not take long after that. <1> Another 18 years is not a bad run, but it is sort of depressing to go to  a Kmart now, the atmosphere is just bad <0> Our local Kmart shut down.  In 2005 there were only 1416 Kmarts left. <1> Oh wow, that is a big drop, I imagine it is even smaller now considerably <0> Yes it is now. Quite sad though.
<0> When I see little homeless girls I feel like a father. <1> Do you have daughters of your own?

<0> I love Gospel music,it inspires me alot <1> Me too! It usually involves dominant vocals and harmony, which is the best part about it. I'm really not into the God part personally. <0> How about you favorite gospel artist? <1> I actually haven't heard a lot of gospel singers. What is yours? Gospel music goes waaay back to the 17th century. <0> Fred Hammond, don't Moen et al, you can name yours too.Guess you have the information already? <1> I just don't know specific artists. I do love Southern gospel the most, which is a type of Christian music.

<0> I got a random email this morning with a $120 gift voucher <1> Wow was it a scam or was it legit? <0> I was really sure it was a scam but it turned out it was a prize for a survey I had submitted a few weeks ago! <1> That is so good congratulations you are lucky what are you going to use it for? <0> I'm going to use it to buy a few t-shirts and pair of jeans!
<0> hello, what do you think about people with brown hair? <1> I love brown hair, I was born with brown hair. <0> Me too, Brown hair is most common after black hair <1> Wow, I would have thought blonde hair was most common.  <0> Me too, Its strands are actualle thicker than those of fair hair except those that have red hair <1> I wish that I had never dyed my hair blonde it damaged it terribly.
<0> What do you think of harley-davidson motorcycles? <1> Well I have not been around since they were founded in 1903, but since they seem to be a good company. <0> Have you ever ridden a motorcycle before? I have a motorcycle, but it's not a harley-davidson. <1> No, I have never ridden one. But I do love riding bicycles. The motorcycle originally came from bicycles. <0> That's so cool. I didn't know that. What kind of bicycle do you ride?  <1> Well I just have a street bike, but I would love to try mountain biking which focuses on off-road and rough terrain.
<0> Yes, that is such a strange concept. Where is it that they do that? <1> It beats what they used to do in India; they burned them on the husband's funeral pyre.  Around the world treatment still varies and can be severe. <0> Very interesting, I'm glad I live where I do.  <1> It happened long time ago in India. Now it's changing <0> That is good to know, I used to work for someone who was born in India. <1> Oh, That's nice. I am from India. currently studying at Australia <0> Wow, I had no idea. How do you like Australia?

<0> Baking, or the method of cooking baked goods, is so much fun. <1> yea it really is. <0> Baking can involve hot ashes or even hot stones. <1> Oh yea? what else? <0> Baking can also involve just a normal oven. <1> Oh wow i like cooking and baking using anything. <0> I really like baking sweet stuff but bread is the most common. <1> Oh yea i can imagine thats true.
<0> My brother recently went on vacation and said he saw a manta ray when he was on a boat in the ocean. <1> really they  are large rays belonging to the genus "Manta <0> I don't know much about them, but he did say they are large. Do you know if they sting? <1> no but black manta  is a fictional supervillain appearing in American comic books <0> Hmmm interesting. Do you know anything else about manta rays? What do they eat? <1> i may not but The character first appeared in "Aquaman" <0> That's interesting I guess. I was hoping to learn more about manta rays, the actual creature. <1> yes you can learn more black manta had no definitive origin story
<0> Got on the scale today. I've only been on a diet 2 weeks and I'm down 17 pounds. <1> That is great news. Have you also been working out? <0> Not really. I average 10 miles a day walking at work but did that when I was fat as well. I cut out all processed foods and drinks.
<0> My mom is here visiting me and my family. It has been a really fun visit.  <1> Sounds nice. How long has it been since you've seen her? <0> About seven months. Too long. 
<0> Our puppy wiggled out of his leash. He ran toward the busy road and was hit by a car. It was awful <1> Oh god,  I am so sorry. Is he okay now? <0> Sadly,  no. He passed away at the vet a few hours later. <1> I hate to hear that. It is so hard to lose a pet. I hope you are doing okay through this. <0> I am actually trying to cope,it's not easy.
<0> Snoop Dogg, or Calvin Cordozar Broadus, is my favorite rapper of all time. He is also a producer, songwriter, and actor! <1> I really liked his album "Reincarnated", and his talk show <0> What was the name of his talk show? My favorite album of his is Doggystyle, which was produced by Dr. Dre, another one of my favorite rappers. <1> The "Joker's Wild", a show in which comedians win money, and he is a great host <0> Oh I've heard of it. It was produced by Jack Barry, right? <1> Yes, and I like "Dead or Alive" with Tupac and Snoop Dog <0> Yeah. It's really sad that it would've debuted on Tupac's 46th birthday! <1> Yeah never mind, I have no idea who he is.
<0> I am on vacation in Bali and I want to move here so badly. It is the most beautiful place in the world! <1> That sounds awesome! What's your favorite part of your vacation so far? <0> I love hiking through the rice fields and the fruit here is out of this world!!
<0> What is your favorite number? Mine is the number 7 <1> I like 7, seems pretty cool. I mean it comes after 6 and before 8. <0> I just remembered a joke from when I was a Kid. "Why was 6 afraid of 7?' <1> Yeah I have heard that, funny. Long ago 7 was written in a curve so it looked like a J. <0> Really? I didn't know that. Why was it changed from the curved J to the 7 it is today? <1> That is just how they wrote. The western Ghubar Arabs' made it more diagonal than straight to kind of differentiate it. <0> I guess that would make sense. 
<0> I do not live in NY. There are locations all over. <1> I think it feels good to deal in party brands. which specific outlet were you working for? <0> So what location do you prefer to live? <1> In the Phoenix area. <0> Interesting indeed, i suppose there could be much partying in that area <1> I hate party brands
<0> We moved into a 200 year old house. There are creeks and cracks that creep me out! <1> I can only imagine. At least its nice in the day time though? <0> Sometimes. I try to avoid that attic during any time of the day! There's also a weird door about knee-height. When you open it up,  it's just big enough to fit a storage tub.
<0> I love harley davidson's, so much so i attend their owners clubs. How about you? <1> I haven't but there is an owner's club in Toronto it looks like, close by. What do you do at the club?  <0> mainly chat about the bikes, like the shovelhead engine because it looked like coal be shoveled into the engine when turned upside down lol <1> How often do you guys ride? Looks like you have specific rules about riding in a particular formation and a captain for the front and back <0> i believe you're right, theres an entire section in the harley davidson museum which goes over those rules. haha. I try to get out as often as i can, work tends to scupper that though <1> I know, work has been holding me back from joining too. Looks like it's the 115th anniversary for Harley in September which is cool. Will you guys celebrate? <0> I'll try to get over to america to celebrate the the founding in 1903, Milwaukee Wisconsin here i come :-) <1> Haha! Amazing :) You can hit the museum at the same time.

<0> I love wine. I like to taste different types and examine it with my senses. <1> Really? I don't drink alcohol so I know nothing about wine. Are there different types of wine? <0> Yes definitely! There are reds and whites. My favorite is white wine. It can range in color from straw-yellow to yellow-gold <1> Do they taste different? What is wine made of anyways? <0> Yes, the reds are more sweet and the whites a little "sharper". Wine is made starting with fruit that is then fermented into alcohol. Most people use grapes but it can be made with berries too.
<0> My favorite color is red! I think it is bright and cheerful. Do you know anything about the color red? <1> Red is the colour at the end of the visible spectrum of light <0> That's really cool. What do they say about how the color red makes you feel? <1> It is a primary color in the RGB color model and the CMYK color model, and is the complementary  <0> That sounds neat. What else do you know about the color red? <1> Reds range from the brilliant yellow-tinged scarlet and vermillion to bluish-red crimson, <0> Is red a really popular color? <1> Yeah, a lot of people like the color red. 
<0> I've never seen it. Who do you think should star in the remake if they do one? <1> Vivien Leigh  played the original Scarlett and I think Angelina Jolie would be perfect. Or even Scarlet Joanson <0> I think Scarlet Joanson would be perfect <1> Agreed! We have been seeing a lot of remakes recently. What do you think of them? <0> Some of them are alright, but I prefer movies that are new stories  <1> New is nice. All of the series and whatnot lately has seemed a little stale to me as well <0> Precisely. It seems all that Disney is doing anymore is remakes and sequels, when was the last new movie that was a new story? <1> I couldn't tell you. Not just Disney. Star Wars this, Marvel that, etc. Can we see some creativity out of Hollywood? <0> i think there's lots of creativity in Hollywood
<0> I was walking through walmart and noticed people staring. i went to the bathroom and to check my clothing and i had a huge brown stain on my rear! i sat in chocolate,  i was moritified <1> That must of been horrible.
<0> Last week during the night someone came into my yard and stole my push mower. <1> Oh no!  Do you have any way of finding out who did it? <0> No,  I called the police but it's almost impossible to track. I had to chained to a steel post,  but they cut the chain with bolt cutters I guess. I sure hate thieves. <1> Yeah,  thieves are terrible.  I mean,  who would steal a mower? <0> anyone can
<0> Yeah me too. I really love fresh vegetables though like cucumbers. <1> I am currently trying to grow a mixture of root vegetables, tomatoes and herbs so keep your fingers crossed for me. <0> Do you plan on canning the vegetables or just eat them fresh? <1> mainly herbs and a few vegetables . <0> That's cool is there anything else you like to do <1> I do a lot of home projects.  <0> Oh that's cool! like what? <1> I just stripped my moms porch and painted it. Farmhouse-chic.  <0> Does your mom like to grow vegetables like you do?
<0> I just can't stand it anymore. My partner nags almost about every detail of our relationship. Just yesterday, she criticized my taste for clothing <1> That would get very irritating. Have you talked to her about it and let her know how you feel? <0> I have. She is not very appreciative of my hobbies.  <1> That’s a shame, what are your hobbies? <0> I enjoy rock collecting and have recently developed a knack for macaroni art <1> Have you tried getting her involved in your hobbies?
<0> Hi there! Have you ever heard of the San Diego Comic-Con? <1> Not San Diego's specifically, but definitely comic-con in general. Definitely not into comic book conventions...you? <0> Funny you should ask, I went to my first ever comic convention here in Houston this year. I don't have much interest in comic books or anything, but found it interesting.  <1> Did you participate in cosplay? What is your character of choice? <0> Actually, no I did not dress in cosplay. But if I did, I probably would have went as an Overwatch character! Maybe McCree? <1> I have no idea who those characters are. If I dressed in cosplay, I would definitely be sailor moon--probably the only anime I ever watched
<0> i wish i could lose weight, i'm so obese  <1> i have some excess body fat as well. so i feel you on that <0> i don't even know how i became so obese <1> i don't know your situation but obesity is most commonly caused by exessive food intake, lack of physical activity and even genetic susceptibility <0> i do workout but i think i overeat. I tend to eat a lot when i'm stressed <1> it's more common than you think. I feel like food is so comforting! I strongly advice you to see a professional and start losing weight because obesity increases the likelihood of type 2 diabetes, sleep apnea even certain types of cancers
<0> I love to bake! Especially when it's for my family or close friends. Do you like to bake? <1> I love to bake also. <0> What are some of your favorite things to bake? <1> I really enjoy baking bread. <0> Any particular kind of bread? Or just normal ole' bread? I love eating freshly baked bread. :) <1> I really enjoy making Mexican breads. <0> Oh I don't think I've ever tried that before, it sounds really good though I wanna try it sometimes. <1> Baking is very important for me to maintain my nutrition.
<0> One thing on my bucket list is to go to the San Diego Comic Con, it is a entertainment convention held each year in San Diego. <1> I have always wanted to go to E3, the video game convention, that seems really cool as well <0> What do you think about the New York CC? It's not as old as San Diego or E3, only first held in 2006 but I think it has potential.  <1> I have never been, but I am a fan of super heroes so I would like to check it out sometime <0> I think you would like comic conventions then, there are usually a wide variety of panels, focusing on super heroes, there is also great cosplay. <1> I have seen some of the cosplay, it is usually very very well done, I am impressed by a lot of them <0> Yes, it is impressive. It has really taken off since the 1990s, the number of people doing it in Japan and the Western world has risen rapidly. 
<0> I was at the mall and I smelled the sweet smell of cinnamon rolls. It reminded me of home <1> that is awesome. where is your "home"? <0> I am from the south, Alabama, how about you? <1> I read a lot. Alabama seems to come up in several of Stephen King's books. <0> I also read alot, love learning new things. What else do you like reading? <1> I read the Bible more often than anything else. My son is an author so of course I read his books. <0> Oh really? Does he write fiction or nonfiction? <1> mostly fiction. I help edit his books. <0> You guys must have a good relationship. I have made some money on side by editting various mediums. <1> He does not pay me for editing, but I get sneak peaks and several FREE books. We do have a great relationship. <0> Free books is a great perk. Is he your only child? <1> No, I have 3. Sadly for me the oldest is in eternity. <0> I'm sorry to hear that! I don't have any kids yet, hoping someday I will though <1> Sorry my dear
<0> I was glad my dad asked me to go on a mission trip with him. <1> Nice! Where did you go?
<0> What!  That is unbelievable!  I love soccer!  What position do you play? <1> Yes me too, I play as a forward and have won 13 League titles with Arsenal! <0> wow!!!! congratulations <1> Thank you, I couldn't have done it without an amazing team! <0> it is very important to work as a team <1> Yes, it is.  My team mates have also become great friends.  My best friend, Calden has been there for me on and off the field. <0> awesome! i love having friends that you can count on <1> Absolutely - it's a necessity.
<0> i do as well . i also like fashion a lot . <1> i currently have alot of kids <0> How many kids do you have? <1> 2- but that is a lot, trust me. <0> I wouldn't know, I don't have any kids.  Do you have time for yourself with 2 kids? <1> Not really. I used to follow my favorite band's tour, but not anymore. :( <0> That's too bad.  I would love to be a band's fashion coordinator.  It would be right up my alley. <1> That sounds like fun! I always assumed bands just put on whatever clothes they felt like. <0> That's what they want you to think, but the biggest bands have their outfit coordination down to a science. <1> why dont you apply for a job doing that? i know alot of bands need people like that.
<0> Do you have brown hair? I think it is a very common hair color. <1> I do have brown hair, but it's almost black. Brown hair is the second most common hair of all the coors actually. <0> That's interesting. It must be a dominant gene trait then since so many people have it! <1> It trusly must be. It's crazy though that brown hair varies so much. It goes from light to almost black <0> Yes, I like how there are so many varieties of brown from red tints to black. Mine tends to be more mousey brown, so I like to lighten it.
<0> I really like going out to eat, but it might be bad for my health <1> Well, I think that all depends on where you're eating and how much you eat. Do you think you're eating anywhere unhealthy? <0> Probably, fast food is just bad for you in general. <1> Yes that's true. You probably want to check out this organic diner across town. I heard that Kid Rock was last seen there. He is a delight. <0> Are they expensive? <1> No that expensive. It's slightly more than your usual chain restaurants but it's worth it. Are you tight on budget? <0> Yeah, I know the best way to save money is to buy groceries, but Im not a great cook. <1> Ah, well don't worry. Everyone starts somewhere. You can learn from online tutorials. This purple diner channel is a great start. <0> Oh really? Thanks! <1> Yup no worries. I love everything purple so maybe you will enjoy it too. Have you been doing more groceries shopping now? <0> Yeah, the local grocery store is great, they tons of bogo's <1> i usually just get all my food free from the food pantry.
<0> like a soap opera ? are you an actor or actress in it ? <1> yes like a soap opera . and i am an actress . what about you ? <0> soap opera is alright, i am into a lot of different shows. not an actress though <1> That is ok, it isn't for everyone. What shows are you watching now? <0> various shows, ranging from the office to merlin <1> The office is my favorite show! My favorite character is Dwight <0> dwight is quite the character, love back and forth with him and jim <1> Yes he is. He and Angela were meant to be, in my opinion <0> i have to agree there. i would love a reboot or a where are they now season of the office
<0> I do not like being bothered when I am working. <1> Me too, it throws my frequency off.  <0> especially when I've entered a very productive streak <1> Absolutely. I hate getting thrown off. I am a very driven person. <0> Me too, I like the feeling of accomplishing something, from start to finish. That is its own reward. <1> I agree. I coach football and that's a message I tell my players. <0> That's awesome, I haven't played sports in a while but I've been thinking about volunteering for my local youth club, they currently need more referees <1> You should try it! Get some experience and you'd be more qualified than the NFL referees. <0> I'm really considering it, especially since I could take my kid there to get some quality playing time <1> You should do that! I'm sure your kid would love it. My brother used to referee at the youth club. <0> Cool, how flexible are the schedules? It's hard to balance things with my job and toddler <1> I would have to ask my brother. He still lives in my hometown, Syracuse.
<0> I try to stay physically fit through proper nutrition and light to moderately vigorous exercise, do you do similar things? <1> I need to! It' been a while but I was way into fitness. Now my fitness is fitness this donut in my mouth. What all do you do? Way interested.  <0> Well you can start by just walking 30 minutes a few times a week, and then build into some kind of physical exercise like swimming or weight training. I like weight training because I like seeing my muscles grow and I find it enjoyable. <1> I used to LOVE going to the gym. My life had some changes recently, it's hard getting back in the swing of things. I do, however walk 30 minutes a day. Do you stick with a certain diet? <0> Absolutely diet is probably key to maintaining your figure
<0> I'm thinking about owning my first home. <1> That's awesome! Is something holding you back? <0> Honestly the commitment to house repairs.  <1> Yeah, that is a commitment and can be costly. Do you have anything in savings? <0> Yea,i have some
<0> I really like to bake but seem to burn everything lately. Do you ejoy baking? <1> Ive been getting really good at baking. I have even baked things using hot stones and hot ashes, but that is not the most common method. Normally I just bake in the oven. <0> I've heard of those methods that's awesome! So you must know a great deal about baking. <1> Id like to think so. For beginners the most common item to bake is bread. Then you can branch out and bake other various food items. I would start with that. <0> Is that what you started with? I remember being little and my grandmother would give me a small chunk of dough to play with. <1> That must be a good memory. I wouldnt call myself a baker though since I am no professional. I do enjoy doing it in my spare time. It also makes my friends happy. <0> I'd say anyone that bakes and is good at it should be allowed to call themselves a baker. What else do you know about baking? <1> not much as i am not an expert
<0> Some markets have to be avoided,  that is if you valued your sense of smell. <1> I know what you mean. Wednesdays there's this market I like to go to,  but lately it just has so much rotten food <0> Yet there's still something about that imperfection,  do you agree? <1> Totally. I still love to go have a look around <0> yes, that is totally true
<0> Yesterday i left my luggage behind for a stranger to look after it <1> Why did u leave your luggage for a stranger <0> That was so naive on my part,  i had to leave shortly to buy a drink from the shop. <1> Wao, its a mistake,  <0> Yeah it was a big mistake, they stole it from me.
<0> I was super irritated when my boss kept pulling my hair for fun! <1> I can see why! That's highly inappropriate.   <0> He seems to think otherwise for some reason. I am thinking about reporting him to the HR. <1> You should. He is obviously at the very least flirting with you and at worst harassing you <0> My boss respects me very well and never touches me!
<0> hi , should we be friends ? <1> hey , i was freaking poor growing up ! but my favorite food was cheeseburgers ! <0> who does not love cheeseburgers ? that's my jam <1> i'm retired , i was a gym teacher <0> whoa i can not even imagine retiring yet . i am so young <1> yeah i volunteer at the soup kitchen a lot now <0> i should do that . i have all this free time since i broke my arm <1> yeah , its a good cause
<0> that's cool ! i work for the government . do you like sports ? <1> that sounds like a good job . yes , nascar on sundays . you ? <0> i am a baseball fanatic.  have you watched any of the world series? <1> I have not, I did hear that England lost recently though. <0> I'm not sure that england was in the world series of baseball, I think that's probably soccer. <1> Ah yes. I didn't notice that. I still very impressed by their performance for small country. <0> Do you like watching soccer? <1> Of course. I played soccer growing up myself. <0> Me too!  What do you do now for fun? <1> I love watching nascar races, its such a thrill! Also I love going out on dates with my girlfriend. What about yourself? 
<0> Its among the top recreational activities and great exercise too. <1> Do you have a favorite stroke you like to practice?  Butterfly, backstroke, for instance? <0> I enjoy doing the butterfly. Makes me feel alive! I also get to show off in front of my family. <1> I think the Butterfly is the hardest stroke, it takes a lot of practice to get it right. 
<0> i'm thinking about having mexican or italian . <1> either sounds great do you like the outdoors <0> haiii <1> Have you ever had the Mexican street food? <0> yes i will eating in braek fast <1> what do you think you will have for dinner? <0> yes i eating dinner <1> What will you eat?
<0> Yes, did you enjoy those times <1> I loved them but in some regions the call kindergarten "1st" so grade 12 is sometimes gard 13 <0> That's interesting - what was your favorite subject in school? <1> I think my favorite is history! <0> Intersting, mine was literature. <1> So what do you do for a living? <0> My wife and I are missionaries.  What about yourself? <1> I work as a librarian at the city library.
<0> Hey man guess what i found my old Pooh Bear doll. <1> Oh that's really cool. Was it from your childhood? <0> yes. i used to sit and hold that sweet worn-down doll while i watched the cartoon ... aahhhh ... memories.  <1> That's sweet. On Saturday mornings, I binged watched cartoons when I was a kid. Some habits die hard. <0> oh! that is a good habit to keep. cartoons keep you young. i like to watch cartoons here and there myself. <1> Me too. My daughter and I binge-watched the entire Looney Tunes Boxed Set. Destroyed my eyes for 2 days! <0> LOL!  that is so cool. daughters are cool.  my daughter still giggle and crack jokes with each other. she is 25. <1> My daughter is 19 and, now that she's grown, we look (and find) deep hidden meanings in Looney Tunes. And Spongebob. <0> LOL! and sesame street ... even thought they are puppets ... are my favorite to think deeply about. they really are people in your neighborhood! <1> Yes! Jim Henson had REAL people in mind when he designed those guys!!!
<0> I love to exercise. I feel so sluggish on days when I don't work out at the gym. <1> Me too! Exercise helps me with a state of health and well-being. It allows me to perform aspects of sports, work, and daily activities. <0> What kind of sports do you like to play? <1> I do strength training which is a type of exercise that specializes in using resistance to induce muscular contraction to build my strength up. <0> That's great! Do you like to use dumbbells and barbells? <1> Yes I do, they are used to oppose the force generated by my muscles through concentric or eccentric contractions!.
<0> One time when I was younger I wore a Halloween costume that I'd been looking forward to show off.  But I ended up covering myself up with a cape,  because I was self conscious of how I looked. <1> Aww- I'm sorry that happened. Why were you embarrassed? <0> Well the costume itself ended up looking great,  since my mom made it.  But I hadn't realized how fat I looked when i wore it,  so I felt bad. <1> It's always difficult when you feel self-conscious - but I've learned that people rarely judge you as hard as you judge yourself. 
<0> This weekend was kind of a drag. <1> Oh yeah? Why is that? <0> I couldn't find anyone that wanted to hangout so I had to spend the whole weekend by myself.
<0> good day how are you today ? <1> doing just fine . just pulled some cookies out of the oven . smells heavenly . <0> sounds good , i just returned from a hike so cookies would be great right now <1> oh man . i bet my dogs would love going hiking . just not my thing though . <0> small world , i've a black lab and his name is trooper , what is your dogs name ? <1> i've a german shepherd named king and an english bulldog named major . <0> awesome , what do you do for a living ? <1> i actually a professional baker . what about you ?
<0> I love the Italian car maker called Ferrari. They make some of the most iconic supercars in the world! What car brands do you like? <1> I like to watch races . I know the Ferrari is a race car and is in the Formula One races. But no one in particular. <0> Ferrari has multiple cars... They have F1 race cars, supercars, and hyper cars. They are a brand. What races do you watch from Ferrari? <1> Yeah, I know. I like their road cars . The racing cars are just for racing I thought. Like the Formula one races <0> Yup, though you referred "the Ferrari" is solely race cars for Formula One that is the highest class of single seating auto racing.
<0> yes i run them all the time ! how exciting , are you ready <1> i think so , i just hope the weather is nice . any weekend plans ? <0> Probably cruising in my mustang! what about you? <1> I´d love to get in the mountains and check any tree leaves still changing colours.
<0> definitely ! i love running its a great escape . <1> agreed , that and a healthy diet i say ! i am personally a vegetarian <0> What are some of your favorite vegetarian dishes?   <1> Olives! And all the vegetables. <0> Olives would definitely make a good snack.  Where do you find recipes for meals? <1> I use internet a lot <0> Do you have any favorites? I'm always looking to try something new and vegetarian dishes can turn out REALLY good. <1> No, I find most of them on Facebook <0> Those facebook recipes make everything look so easy but a lot of them can be hard!  Any Facebook pages I can follow that have your favorite recipes? <1> I normally read what my friends post. Most of them love cooking  <0> Well that's cool, I bet you share lots of ideas.
<0> ive been baking since i was little. My mom loves when i made cakes <1> I love baking too. It is a good form of cooking where Heat is gradually transferred "from the surface of cakes, cookies, and breads to the centre. <0> never thought of it like that. i haven't cooked bread though before. Any tips on how to make it come out right? <1> Well bread is the most common baked item. Definitely there are lot of recipes that will talk about it <0> well ive done more sweets than anything but anyways, whats your favorite bread recipe ? <1> Just give me any staple food prepared from a dough of flour and water and get it baked. I will love it
<0> Yeah, you're right. I think that's why I'm so fascinated when I see foreign languages. The meaning we connect to images or orders of symbols are so interesting <1> well most people think that reading is a means of language acquisition, communitcaition and sharing of information and i deas <0> i love to read because it is easier to gain knowledge through literature since you can interpret the words how you want <1> I enjoy reading as well it takes me to a new world. <0> people also have a habit of allowing their biases to show through when speaking to one another. even teachers do it <1> Everyone should be allowed to think for themselves without all the outside influences. <0> i completely agree. having the information is vital but i think its more important to have objective, factual information first to form your own opinion <1> I definitely agree with you on that. <0> it's actually insane how people can teach children things and skew their entire world view. <1> Yes, that is very true people try and shape young minds to fit their beliefs. <0> i think that's part of why being a parent today is how hard, especially when so much of the world is still unconscious <1> The world is so much different now than when I was a kid being a parent would be hard.
<0> Can you believe that I turn 37 next week, yet I've never had any alcohol before? <1> My father was an alcoholic growing up, but hes been sober for 20 years.So no alcohol for 20 years. <0> I think after having had a problem with alcohol, being sober for 20 years is more of an accomplishment than never touching it at all. <1> He did the Twelve Step Program through Alcoholic Anonymous.  We're very proud of him. <0> I would be as well!  Do you do anything to celebrate his sobriety anniversary?  <1> Not particularly, but he does help other alcoholics make it through the program. <0> It's always nice to see people give back to the programs that helped them out. <1> AA takes their theory from the Big Book which also helps other addictions such as heroin addiction, marijuana addiction, and gambling addiction. <0> Given how large of an addiction problem there is, it is good to hear there are established programs in place to help.
<0> a little baseball . i watch a lot of anime but no computer games . <1> cool , anime is okay . i really like online games <0> never got into online games, there isn't any I'm interested in <1> There are online games for pretty much anything that interests you. <0> I'm really into bowling - are there computer games about bowling? <1> Yes, I actually know a really good bowling game that you can play right in your browser. I could send you a link if you like?
<0> My daughter graduated high school as a straight A student last year <1> That's amazing! You must be so proud. <0> Oh I am. It's nice to know that I raised a child with a good head on her shoulders.

What kind of books do you like?
<0> i will sing and dance for you . about staying up all night . <1> sounds like a lot of fun to me . <0> You could always dance too <1> I love to dance especially to 80's rock music!  What is your favorite genre of music?  <0> I love rock music but like to dance to hip hop <1> Hip hop is awesome, very high energy! O love dancing to that as well. <0> Do you like to dance much> <1> Yes, I love to go out dancing with friends quite a bit.  How about you? <0> It's not my favorite activity, I'm not much of a dancer to be honest.
<0> yeah i got fired from work now i am looking for something new <1> i know the feeling i got fired in june . i'm looking for a job as well <0> Yeah it's tough, I really don't know what to do with myself right now. <1> What about working online? <0> I'm trying to do that, but the pay is very low.
<0> Red is the color at the end of the visible spectrum of light. <1> I love the color red! <0> Reds range from scarlet and vermillion to crimson, and vary in shade from pink to burgundy. <1> I wonder how they obtain red dye. <0> In the Renaissance, red costumes for the wealthy were dyed with kermes and cochineal. <1> I wonder what other meanings red takes on. <0> Roman generals had their bodies colored red to celebrate victories. <1> Why do you think a stop sign is red?
<0> I went to a hockey game with my five year old son earlier this year. I had to bring lots of supplies! <1> Oh yeah? Do you have to do that every game?
<0> hello , how are you this morning ? <1> i survived cancer for 3 years ! ! i am cancer free ! ! <0> how cool ! congratulations ! you should come watch me wrestle . <1> yeah sure ! i run marathons i am preparing one for this summer <0> i run as well as put a lot of time on the weights . <1> that is awesome i'm also a clean eater <0> i am on a raw diet . have you tried it ? <1> no i've never tried raw diet before <0> you may like it . do you volunteer ? i do at a shelter . <1> No, i don't volunteer
<0> I've been consistently working out the past few weeks <1> That's great! Are you seeing results? <0> Absolutely,  I feel so much better too <1> I bought a spin bike but I haven't used it yet <0> Maybe I should try that.
<0> it is amazing to find something you love and so important . <1> that's true and i know how much work it will take to make it happen . <0> If you really care about something, you'll do anything though. <1> That's true too.  I love my you tube channel so I work hard to make it successful.   <0> how long have you been doing it for? <1> It's been about 5 years now. I've learned so much since I first started. <0> Wow that is awesome! My wife and I are so busy with the kids that I don't know if I'd have time. <1> you will just have to make the time when you can . just do not miss out  on the kids.  That is most important. <0> Yes, they are definitely the most important thing in my life.
<0> hi . i'm home on facebook since i don not work today . <1> hi . i live in the country , raise horse but i want to move to the big city . <0> i use to live in the country with my wife . <1> i want to move to the big city and be a lawyer . <0> my wife left me . she took our children . <1> i am so sorry to hear that . <0> i'm so overweight and very unhappy . <1> i am happy to hear that
<0> Red is my favorite color, it's so powerful and aggressive I feel like. <1> Red is a great color! Plant's don't grow too good under it but its at the end of the visible light spectrum! <0> Really, do you know exactly what wavelength the color red occurs at? <1> It can vary but it's approximately 625-740 nanometers n width. It's very wide! <0> Oh wow that is a big range. Red has so many hues too, it's such an interesting color. <1> Yeah, it's cyan's complementary color too, which happens to be a favorite shade of blue of mine. <0> That's really neat, I think red has a large psychological component to it also, do you know anything about the psychology of colors? <1> I know much about color theory, which runs along the same principles. As it happens, it was Leonardo da Vinci's notebooks that were found in 1490 that first sparked the controversy of the field. <0> It sounds like it has such a deep history to it then, can you tell me more about color theory? <1> Looking at different colors and shades of colors can affect the mood of a person.
<0> My nephew told me once of something really stupid that he would do if the situation arose <1> What situation? <0> if his mom forget him in the car at the grocery <1> oh jeez haha that's my worst nightmare. I always make sure to get everyone out of the car. <0> Me too. Anyway he would hide until back home to scare his mom. <1> jeez that would scare me so bad. <0> Yea. You know what scare me the most in life? <1> No. What?
<0> I'm not very religious so I don't know a lot about gospel music, can you tell me anything about that style? <1> Of course! I'd love to, I'm a huge fan of gospel music! It's known for its dominant vocals, strong use of harmony and Christian lyrics. It's really beautiful music. <0> That does sound powerful just reading about it, does it have a long history? <1> It does, but it's not well documented. The earliest use of the term "gospel song" was first published in 1874. <0> Oh I would imagine it's probably older than that given the history of churches I guess. Are there any famous gospel artists I should know about? <1> Well actually, before it was known as gospel music, that typical style of music can be traced back to the early 17th century. <0> I didn't know. What was it called?
<0> that is going to make your career interesting . especially when someone has pizza . <1> yuck ! right now i work at a clinic . how about you , work or hobbies ? <0> I am currently a student, I am going to be a vet. <1> Oh wow!  That sounds like a rewarding career.  I love animals. <0> Me too! LOL! I have a pet dog, and she inspires me everyday. I can't wait to work with all types of animals. Do you have a pet? <1> Yes, I have a dog.  He's a rescue and the best dog ever, in my opinion. LOL   <0> I totally agree with having a rescue dog, or pet, they deserve loving homes. I personally not attracted to pure bred dogs, to many potentials for birth defects. <1> Yes, I agree.  I hear that a lot.  It seems like they know they were rescued and are now very much loved. <0> I really think rescued animals, actually rescue us more.  <1> Yes, I absolutely agree.  
<0> hello ! how are you this evening ? <1> good . watching the race . and you ? <0> ok , for someone with their heart outside their body . <1> oh man . how did that happen ? <0> born that way . had to have a transplant , but it seems ok now . <1> crazy . what do you do to stay happy ? <0> i really like moving stuff with my mind . and you ?
<0> I found a text message on my wife phone. She is cheating on me. <1> I'm sorry to hear that. Did you confront her about it? <0> I found out about it while walking along the beach. I saw her tweet out a picture with her other man. I was devastated.  <1> That's terrible man! What are you going to do now? <0> I don't know. I need to talk to her about it. All i've been doing now is listening to sad pop music. <1> oh that is terrible ! i am so sorry ! my heart goes out to you . how long were you together ? <0> 5 whole years. I have no idea how long she's been doing this.  <1> Do you think there is any hope of saving your marriage? 5 years is a lot to give up on. <0> I don't know. I need to talk to her about it. She doesn't know that i know yet. Maybe we can goto counseling.  <1> That's going top be a tough conversation. I can't imagine having that talk with my wife. I hope it goes okay. <0> So for now I just need to collect my thoughts. <1> I understand. Are you sure it was ,"another man"? There is no way it's just a misunderstanding? <0> You're right. A photo isn't everything. I need to talk to her. <1> yeah, just sit with her and understand what is going on
<0> I do not like being bothered when I am working. <1> Me too, it throws my frequency off.  <0> especially when I've entered a very productive streak <1> Absolutely. I hate getting thrown off. I am a very driven person. <0> Me too, I like the feeling of accomplishing something, from start to finish. That is its own reward. <1> I like that too, because it makes me feel fulfilled. 
<0> I am really scared of Manta ray's since i say it killed the crocodile hunter <1> I want to learn more about them, I know they beach like whales, are they poisonous? <0> im not sure if they are poisonous but they have a big sharp dagger on their tailes <1> I know they are found in sub tropical and tropical waters and they look scary <0> Yes they do, one time i was in the ocean and saw one jumped like 20ft away from me i was so scared <1> They are listed as endangered by International Union for Conservation of Nature
<0> I had to help my dad move some heavy stuff around this past weekend. <1> Moving,  is always such a pain. Did it go smoothly at least? <0> Yeah.  He kept up with me pretty well. <1> That's good,  glad he wasn't having too tough a time. <0> Yeah.I love my dad.

<0> I am confident about my new job, and I can not wait to get started! <1> Awesome, what field do you work in? <0> Horse racing! Right now I just help with the horses but one day I would love to open my own teaching program on horse racing. <1> ooh it is good iam also love horse riding <0> Do you race them? Or just ride for fun? <1> i will ride them .but i love watching horse racing .how many horse racing events did you participate ? <0> On race days, I'd sometimes be in five or six different events every night. 
<0> I was helping my girlfriend pack up her sons toys and he had a lite-brite.  I used to have a lite-brite and loved playing with it when I was younger.  It brought back some good memories. <1> I bought a lite brite from goodwill about a year ago. It was one of the remakes from recent years but we had fun with it.
<0> I freaking dropped my coffee on the ground this morning <1> I hear you! I drop things all the time. Was it one you just bought? <0> Yes.  And to make it even worse I soaked myself!
<0> It's hard for me to handle stress sometimes. I find comfort in eating a lot but I know it's not good for me. <1> Yes, I also overeat sometimes due to stress. It can be considered as an eating disorder. <0> I think it's a common thing but it doesn't mean it's healthy. I usually eat sweets, sugar seems to be making me feel better. <1> Yes some people call that emotional eating. It helps people cope with negative emotions. <0> Yes that's exactly what it is. But it only helps for a little while, it never actually solves any problems besides adding stomach ache. <1> There are healthier ways to regulate emotions, such as exercising and reading a good book. <0> That sounds good. ANother thing I like to do is go on a walk. Especially while being mindful of all the smells and sounds,I like to focus on my surroundings and that opens my senses and helps to think positive. <1> going on a walk is also healthy and solves the problems of stomach ache.
<0> Yes, those are great games. I enjoy the latest one, myself. GTA V <1> The series is very popular. The first installment has sold more than 150 million copes as of Sept. 2013. <0> Wow, that's amazing. One of those copies is mine lol <1> My boyfriend loves playing GTA as well he will spend hours on the game console playing. <0> That's awesome. Do you like playing with him? <1> Mostly.  He really has to guide me so I know what to do.  It's a very complex game. <0> It is! My partner doesn't mind watching me play but she gets so bored watching me play football haha <1> The game has been around since 2005, but I've only started playing recently. <0> Oh, nice. It's never too late to start! I've been gaming my whole life <1> I just have to make sure I take a break. They say sitting down too long is bad for you. <0> Yeah, they say you should take a short walk and stretch for every hour you're sitting.
<0> i am travelling soon,  but i am bringing with myself a lithium ion battery for phone replacement to the airport security,  i am anticipating the security there so i may talk to the person at the desk to confirm i can take such an item <1> yeah. it would be best to check the website for a list of approved items
<0> good day , how are you ? <1> hello , i'm doing well . i think i may have had too much coffee . you ? <0> i'm good , taking a break from my assignments before heading to europe . <1> i went to a star wars convention in helsinki . are you going there ? <0> that sounds fun , i'm actually go to visit the louvre in paris . <1> that is a nice museum , i visited last summer , before football season . <0> i went to spain then , learned i love cooking paella . what team are you for ? <1> i'm with ohio state . born and raised in ohio <0> awesome . what do you do for a living
<0> I was thankful I went on mission trips in high school. <1> Oh that sounds cool,  where to?
<0> I don't like hair coloring <1> I really don't like coloring my hair either. <0> It changes the natural color of the hair <1> Yes, the practice of changing hair color is really strange though. <0> it makes hair turns gray <1> Does it? I really don't think that cosmetic hair color makes it turn gray. <0> Really? <1> Yeah, if anything it is meant to cover gray or white hair. <0> Oh, a friend of mine had a different experience then. 
<0> I love cooking but I am a terrible baker! I need to bake an apple crumb cake, what do I do? <1> Well usually whenever I need baking help I Google it so I'd suggest that! I like baking bread sometimes, but cakes and cookies are good too. <0> Ohh bread.. Maybe I will make that... How do you make bread? <1> Well you just need some dough, water, and yeast and then you can bake it in the oven, quite simple. <0> You don't need anything else? What if I add pepperoni to it? Do I put in from the start or later on in the cooking process? <1> I wouldn't suggest adding a cure porked and beef mixed-together product in my bread, but I guess you could try, I'd add it in from the start I suppose.
<0> I like the color red. <1> i don't really like the color red it's to bright in my opinion <0> My favorite color is blue but I like red because my hair is red <1> red has dominant wavelength of aprox 625-740 nanometres <0> I never knew that <1> Red also a primary color in the RGB color model <0> I did know that <1> the reason i personally don't like the color red is beacuse i have blood phobia <0> Me too, but I do not usually associate the two <1> I work as a nurse and see blood often, which I do not mind.
<0> My sister in law and her fiance are always taking trips abroad and we hardly ever go anywhere. <1> Why don't you join them?
<0> So, last year my parents got me a shotgun for Christmas. I was so stoked! <1> Wow, that's interesting. What do you do with it? <0> Hunt, mostly dove and turkey. Do you hunt? <1> Never, guns are banned in our country. Have you had any luck so far? <0> Got a few dove this season, It didnt really get cold enough for them to come south this year. 
<0> I think Yamaha products are pretty cool! What do you think about them? <1> I have never used a Yamaha product actually, but I know they make musical instruments <0> Now that I think about it, they do. They are pretty diverse with their products but I think that they are overall recreational.  <1> Now that I think more, they do make street bikes, but like smaller versions of harley davidsons <0> It's pretty cool that they make that. I would love to try out one their snowmobiles. I've never used one but they seem quite reliable. <1> I have always wanted to try a snowmobile, snow recreation in general is a favorite of mine, and quick travel in a big blizzard would be cool <0> I would love to be on more mild terrain but think it would be a life saver in a situation like a blizzard.  <1> Speaking of Blizzard, have you ever played Starcraft 1 or 2? 2 is my favorite, Blizzard did a fantastic job making that game <0> I'm sorry to say I haven't played it but I do enjoy trying new things. I will definitely check it out!  <1> i bet you will like it.
<0> In the relationships I have been in i have never cheated,  I have suspicions that the guys I was with did though. <1> That's too bad. Do you have proof of infidelity? <0> Not really,  but my one boyfriend was always very flirty and liked hooking up with girls a lot <1> It's good that you're faithful. Too bad your boyfriend couldn't be less flirtatious and respect you more.
<0> Hello, are you into a physical fitness routine?  <1> I do not currently have one no. <0> I don't have a strict one either but I try to eat the right foods and exercise some. <1> The right foods are often time very expensive, and i'm not the best off with money. <0> It sure is. So I take it you don't shop at places like Whole Foods? <1> I do not think we have one of those at my current location. I live in an underdeveloped location of the world. <0> Ok, I understand. I know they have a lot of stores in North America and United Kingdom. <1> Being from the south, we barely have a mcdonalds. <0> Do you have any Wal-Mart stores where you can buy nutritional stuff? <1> No, but we do have a Target! It's a fancier area so Target is a little nicer!

<0> I really love the number 7! <1> 5,6,7,8 What makes it so special. it can be written in several ways you know ! <0> Really like Roman numerals? <1> 7 follows a natural progression.  In the Bible, I believe it stands for completion <0> Oh that's fascinating. Are there any other numbers significant in the Bible? <1> I am sure there are. There were 13 elders in the church in Revelation ! Seven is also considered a lucky number
<0> I was on lunch and my coworker made me laugh. I pee'ed my self. I felt like I wanted to die. <1> Wow,  did they notice? <0> yep,  to make it worse I'm the boss. I'm pregnant so I tried to pass it off like the baby was pressing on my bladder. 
<0> My daughter has worked very hard to keep her school work finished,  her room clean,  and the dishes washed. I bought her a cell phone for her birthday this year. She is becoming a responsible young preteen <1> Wow,  watching kids grow up is hard. How has she been with the cell phone? <0> She has been good so far. We are trying to limit her access to it to just a few hours per day. She also had to "turn it in" at night before she goes to bed. <1> That's great parenting! You have to trust that your children will make the right choices.
<0> I accidentally dropped my phone at the screen started to glitch out and didn't want to turn on anymore. I was scared because it was a brand new phone. Thankfully after a while of it just sitting there it turned back on normally. <1> That is a huge blessing,  I don't know about you but my life is pretty much keyed into my phone. <0> Same here,  they're so incredibly important in this day and age. <1> It's almost a shame how much we depend on them,  but I know I'd be lost without mine. <0> Yes, nowadays the phone became a crucial part of our lives.
<0> we play country music at the coffee shop where i work . do you work ? <1> yep i drive a semi , its big <0> What kind of truck do you drive? <1> A Mack truck, the classic!  <0> Nice! I have a friend that makes models of semis. They are amazingly detailed. <1> Definitely, amazing machines! So you work in a coffee shop, what's your favourite type of coffee? I love a flat white. <0> I love chai lattes. My mother got me hooked on them. <1> I love them too. Do you have Indian heritage? <0> No, I am from Algeria. Where are you from? <1> Uzbekistan, my family moved to the USA when I was 5 <0> Do you have any brothers or sisters? <1> 5 brothers, 2 sisters. It was very busy at home! How about you? <0> Sounds like it! I am an only child. <1> You must feel lonely
<0> I like jazz. <1> Thats great!  Jazz is a music genre that originated in the african-american communities <0> When did it originate? <1> Jazz originated in the late 19th century  <0> Are there different sub genres of Jazz? <1> Not much info on that but jazz since the 1920's age jaz has been recognized as a major form of musical expression  <0> What is the most common instrument used in Jazz music? <1> Not much information .  But jazz is the swing of blue notes, call and response vocals
<0> I've been diagnosed with Chronic fatigue syndrome. I get so tired and it limits what I can get done in one day. <1> What is Chronic fatigue syndrome? <0> The technical term is myalgic encephalomyelitis. Its a condition where you have long-term fatigue. The cause is not understood though. <1> Is their any solution? <0> There have been no medications or procedures that have been approved for it in the United States. <1> What do you intend to do <0> It has been suggested that cognitive behavioral therapy and gradual increase in exercise could help in some cases so I'm going to try that for now. <1> Trying it out may be the best solution
<0> My favorite color is red since I've been child. Red is also important color in China. <1> I love red because it sets me apart  <0> Our blood is red. I am a doctor so I see a lot of red. Did you that Iron gives the red color to our blood? <1> Yea its so baffling why the creator chose that color for such important item  <0> Color red was very important in history. Only nobility had a red clothes and dresses. <1> I thought the color for nobility was purple. And red for danger to make people intimidated <0> Well in the Renaissance red was the most popular color. One of the first pigment made by men was red, from ochre <1> I was always certain that the color red was for nobility, and that purple was for danger.
<0> I love to read fiction how about you? <1> yes i love the classification for any story or setting that is derived from imagination of the author! <0> Yeah some are really good! do you have a favorite? <1> i enjoy gothic fiction, which is largely known by the subgenre of gothic horror, is a genre or mode of literature and film that combines fiction and horror or death <0> Yeah like lovecraft? <1> well something like Horace Walpole would write such as the 1974 novel The castle of Otranto - A Gothic Story <0> That is really cool! <1> yes and Horace is actually an English Art historian, a man of letters and a antiquarian  <0> That's so neat. I've never read any gothic fiction.
<0> I went for a run tonight despite feeling super depressed these past two weeks. <1> Did it feel good to get back out? <0> It felt amazing,  I'm so happy I was able to push myself onto the right track.

How about you? <0> Probably Vince Vaughn. I like a lot of his movies
<0> I was always afraid to go to bed at night when I was a kid. <1> Why was it  scary movie that did it? <0> Yes I believe so. My mom used to watch horror movies constantly and would have me watch them with her. <1> Oh my! Whenever I feel uneasy I like to bake chocolate chip cookies. <0> I love cookies! Macadamia are my personal favorite. I work at a bar and the country music they play puts me at ease. <1> walnut chocolate chip is my favorite ! I have become quite well at cooking. But I too love some country music playing! <0> I'm experimenting more recently with cooking myself! What are some of your favorite country artists? <1> I like Dolly Parton. Country music is music of working class Americans, it is not popular right now. <0> It's pretty popular where I am in the South. They have large country music festivals here. George Strait and Alan Jackson are my favorites. <1> My mom loved George Strait. In 2009, country music was the most listened to music during rush hour. It's what I always tune in to while sitting in traffic. <0> I even enjoy what they call country rock, like Eagles, .38 Special, etc. <1> love the eagles . classic but they're great .
<0> My favorite color is red.  Do you have a favorite color?  <1> Red is a good color, but I think I prefer pink, which is similar. I never knew it was named after a flower of the same name! <0> What is your favorite shade of pink? My favorite shade of red is crimson. <1> I prefer baby pink, I like the lighter shade of it, it's just so appealing to me, the name pink has been around for a long time, since the late 17th century! <0> Wow that is so cool.  Have you ever read/watched Game of Thrones? In that show House Lannister has crimson red as their family color. <1> I have heard so much about Game of Thrones, I have never watched it before! It looks like the series is ending next year after eight seasons!! <0> Yep it saddens me that it has come to an end.  I am rooting for Jamie Lannister though, hope he gets the throne and sits among crimson red banners <1> Al things must come to an end except Game of Thrones.
<0> I always trust my family like my mom to give me good advice. <1> Yeah that's always comforting.  Mom's are awesome <0> Do you ever disagree with your Mom? <1> Not really.  We usually tend to think alike.  Why do you ask?   <0> Aww,  I didn't really relate until I had children of my own <1> Cool.  So you're the awesome mother here? <0> I'm on my way to be an awesome mom tho.
<0> well that is right up there with ma now a days lol <1> ll yes it is <0> Have you tried drinking proton shakes? <1> I tried a proton shake once and it shook me to my nucleus! <0> That's my go to just mix with water and go!  <1> Don't you just love the band One Direction? <0> They are ok I wouldn't go to a concert without my Bowie knife though. The crowd gets crazy! <1> Yeah, those crowds get crazy. I wouldn't take a Bowie knife because I work out a lot. I really want to be a football player when I grow up. 
<0> yep , i love to work on cars , airplanes , love to keep busy . <1> very nice , how much do you make a year ? <0> I freelance, so it varies quite a bit. On a good year I'm on the six figure fringe. <1> Wow, that's awesome. For my job, I help build cars. I love my job, but it only makes 30k per year. <0> Nothing wrong with that, the most important thing is whether or not it's something you're passionate about and enjoy doing. <1> That's true, for sure. I have met many people who made a lot that did not seem happy or who did not enjoy their jobs. <0> Yeah, freelancing suits me pretty well. I have a hard time sitting still so being able to bounce around and do whatever feels right is nice.  <1> I wish I could do that and feel the way you do, I can't stand my job, it sucks.
<0> I love to work out. How about you? <1> I know how good it is, but I can't get a good routine down. <0> A long time ago people considered fitness to be the ability to carry out your day's duties without getting very tired. <1> It's unfortunate that there are so many jobs now that don't involve any physical work. <0> I agree, manual labor was the primary form of completing physical work, so nowadays people try to make up for the lack of physical jobs by exercising. <1> What are good exercises? <0> Bodyweight exercise is supposed to improve strength, endurance, flexibility and concentration. It uses your own body weight rather than weights or machines. <1> That's interesting. Never would have thought of that.
<0> I let my friend watch my dog last weekend. <1> You must really trust your friend! How did that turn out? <0> It was good,  he (the dog) seemed really happy when I got back. He said that he let my dog out a bunch and even took him to the park! <1> Good to hear that it went so well. Do you think you'll let your friend watch him again? <0> sure, maybe next week because i have to go out 
<0> thanks but no , literally , i'm a big woman . i like eating out a lot . . . <1> ha ! ok . you ever try cooking at home ? it can be good and healthy . <0> I know that's true. But I don't think I got the time for it. Plus I like to try different food <1> There's some great cookbooks for cooking a meal in less than 15 minutes! <0> Yeah...if you have all the ingredients they want you to have...Haha! There is always 1 thing that's missing im my fridge <1> True, although I used some of the services that deliver the ingredients to you for a specific meal, it's really useful <0> Maybe I should invest in some better cookbooks before I try a meal service.
<0> hi <1> Hi,  tell me what's going on with you? <0> not going.hoe are u? <1> Oh,  I'm well thank you. <0> That is nice, hope you had a good day as well?
<0> What kind of cases does he handle? <1> He mainly deals with discrimination in the elderly. <0> Really?  That sounds fascinating. <1> It can be difficult sometimes but he seems to enjoys it. <0> That comes along with the job.  I am also an attorney. <1> That is a powerful type of position, is it difficult? <0> Yes it is. But that's the job description.
<0> what are you doing tonight . i am listening to music <1> i am singing songs from frozen my favorite movie . <0> i liked the movie too . how old are you ? <1> 8 in third grade . i like to play on the playground with my friends . you ? <0> i watch kids on the playground . i teach third grade . <1> awesome ! have you ever been to disney world ? i go every year . <0> i haven't had the pleasure but i am sure i'll soon ! <1> you have to meet mickey mouse he's my favorite . do you have kids ? <0> i don't have kids yet except in class and i love playing games with them .
<0> One of my favorite foods is pasta.  300 different forms, easy to make and hard to master.  What about you? <1> I love pasta, too. My favorite is lasagna. <0> Lasagna was actually invented some time in the Middle Ages, most likely in Naples!  I love it as well! <1> Oh wow, I didn't realize it had been around that long. I prefer it without meat. My mom makes a great veggie lasagna. <0> A friend of mine gets pasta made from rice flour because she does not like gluten.  It apparently tastes a little different. <1> I've never tried rice flour. I imagine it would taste a bit different, though. I've tried coconut flour, but it probably wouldn't taste good in pasta. <0> Well pasta is normally made from wheat flour and usually with eggs, so it is no surprise it would taste a lot different. <1> One time when I had rice flour pasta, I could totally taste a big difference. 
<0> A few years ago after a divorce, my roommates moved away and I gotta tell you, it was rough after that. <1> I am sorry, that sounds rough <0> It was. The only plus side was that it got me away from their dog. <1> I have a very similar experience. Just after I was divorced, I tried the roommate thing. I felt empty when they left. I know what you're going through. <0> Yea being alone is tough. Luckily theres is pizza though, am I right? <1> Pizza is amazing. There's nothing I love more than banging on some Hendrix and eating some fine pizza. <0> DON't FORGET THE BEERS! <1> I hear you! But when I get buzzed, I just want to rock out on my guitar. My neighbours must hate me. <0> Dude I totally feel you! I don't play an instrument but I like to play make beats on this beat maker on my phone. Its pretty chill. <1> True! Do you also use use those beats to rap over? <0> Eh sometimes. Thats actually what I do better of. I'll go find some on youtube and write a couple bars. I think my rhymes are pretty tight <1> Any songs you like to sample or use bass lines from while you rap? <0> Thats the thing, everythings original for the most part. The beat that find, the hook, everything. I only made on and spit over it, the rest somebody else made.  <1> I realize now that I am more free and happy being independent.
<0> I really don't like randomly pumping into old friends,  it get's me nervous,  and i saw one of my old friend's today and  i was surprised,  to say the least <1> yeah it can be akward some times specially if you dont know what to talk about <0> yeah,  so i tried to look for a way out before i admit defeat,  but then i realised there was no way out and so i talked to them in the end <1> yeah a little chat to an old friend cannot hurt did you enjoy the conversation? <0> yeah it wasn't bad in the end,  just awkward  <1> What did you guys talks about?
<0> good evening ! how are you ? <1> i am good ! i was just baking cookies . what about you ? <0> sounds good . just getting back from a night out , i'm exhausted . <1> what happened ? did you get into trouble ? <0> i like to go out dancing , a bit of a party animal . do you ? <1> oh no . maybe when i was younger . do you have any pets ? <0> i've a cat mouse and a dog biscuit . what about you ? <1> one dog sugar . i named her after my famous sugar cookies ! <0> i love cookies . we serve them sometimes at the food bank . <1> oh ! i take them to my county bake sale . i love it there . where are you from ? <0> i live in the city . i like to watch movies , my fave is mean girls . <1> have you ever tried knitting ? i feel like it is the only thing i have anymore . <0> no i never wanted to . why is it the only thing you have ? <1> well being as old as me , it takes my mind off my soon impending end . <0> You did not need to worry and i can give you my one and only pet.
<0> I am afraid of Manta ray while swimming in warm, tropical waters. <1> I got to swim with manta rays once. It was a great experience. Where can I usually find Manta Rays in the world? <0> They are mostly found in warm temperate, subtropical and tropical waters. <1> The ones I saw were very big. About how large can they grow? <0> They can be larger like the "M.birostris" or smaller like "M.alfredi".  Weren;t you scared of them? <1> I've never swam with a manta ray
<0> I swam with manta rays once <1> That would be such an incredible experience.. Where did it happen at? <0> Kona in Hawaii! Manata Rays are large rays with triangular pectoral fins! <1> That's super cool, I've always wanted to try it. Seeing as you got to do it in Hawaii makes it all the cooler! Manta Rays are very fascinating.   <0> Yea it was a one of a time experience! Mantas are found in warm temperate waters as well as tropical <1> I would love to be able to experience it myself someday.. Mantas are going extinct  aren't they? <0> Sadly they are becoming more scarce. Mantas are filter feeders and eat lots and lots of zooplankton <1> Gross, I don't want to go anywhere near them.
<0> It is really hot here most of the year. <1> Really?  Where do you live at? <0> Alabama. It's winter for about 2 weeks. <1> I feel your pain.  I live in Orlando,  Florida.  So Im in the same boat. <0> Do you like it in Florida?

They're cute when they're little though.
<0> A few years ago I decided to move cross-country. It was kind of terrifying taking a huge leap like that with no job and hardly knowing anyone here. <1> You definitely took a leap of faith there. How'd it go? <0> It definitely has had its ups and downs but overall I'm really glad I did it. I don't think I'll be doing it again any time soon that's for sure. <1> hahaha I definitely admire your courage to have done that. <0> Yeah, I was really worried how it would end up, but its been a fun ride.
<0> I'm looking forward to visiting a friend over the weekend <1> That should be fun. Any big planes? <0> Nothing too big,  probably just wander around town <1> That will be nice to catch up.

Yeasted wheat dough is used, broiled and then baked <0> Very interesting, I love the taste, never attempted to make them <1> Do you think you will ever attempt to make them? <0> Not sure, its so easy to buy them lol  are they hard to make? <1> No, but they are a lot easier to buy. Anything else you like to eat? <0> No, I just like to eat bagels.
<0> It was so fun! <1> What was so fun? <0> Taking my dog to the dog park! <1> Oh yeah!!! I love taking my dog too,  she gets to get all that dang energy out before I bring her back to our little apartment! <0> I know exactly what you mean. My dog is usually asleep in the car on our way back home.
<0> I hurt my back and can't mow the grass so it's getting long and everyone elses lawn look so nice. It's embarrassing.  <1> How did you hurt your back? <0> I really don't know.

So many factors are at play. <0> Yes, I can see that, there are a lot of foods. I love iced coffee, how are you with that?

Well, as a baker, I'm sure you have to be a taster as well. Skateboarding sounds like it keeps the pounds off. I'm watching the figure myself. <0> Hahaha! I do eat a lot of cake and it does help. Are you trying to fit into a wedding dress? Maybe it's your cake I'm baking..lol <1> I wish! :-D How soon do you have to bake it? How long does it take?

<0> Everyday i buy my dog because because it is hard and dry <1> You buy your dog? What do you buy your dog? <0> I buy my dog, dog biscuit. It is often sold in a flat bone-shape. <1> Dog biscuits are probably pretty good for them. Does your dog like them? <0> Yes he does and it is a dietary supplement for dogs or other canines, similar to human snack food. <1> That's good to hear. Do you ever feed him real meat? <0> Yes i do especially when the dog biscuit was criticized as particularly bad bread <1> Glad you are keeping up with the latest health buzz. A healthy dog is a must.
<0> I am thinking about coloring my hair. <1> Why? Do you not like your hair colour? What colour are you thinking of changing it to? <0> I like my hair , but friends are doing it so I want to fit in. <1> It's very popular - 75%of women and 18% of men now colour their hair! <0> Maybe I just need to cover the gray with a light brown color. <1> It's very popular to cover grey hair with hair colouring <0> Do you color your hair?

Do ever put garlic or onions in your dishes? <0> I love garlic in my standard Italian pasta dishes. <1> The more garlic the better. Garlic has a lot of health benefits.Do you put any vegetable in your pastas?

<0> I did a walk a thon last week for back to school drive and needy kids it was s long walk but I finished it I felt so happy.  <1> That sounds awesome,  i bet you feel proud! Its nice to do things for kids who are in need.
<0> I hope this doesn't make me sound like a horrible boyfriend,  but when my girlfriend first moved into my house,  I felt very apprehensive towards the move at first. I was used to it being one way,  and she was changing everything. Took some getting used to. <1> I'm sure it did! It's not easy to have to adapt to another person's habits. <0> I know. It caused some tension the first week or so. I had to take a deep breath,  and realize its just things,  and it was just me being reluctant to change.  <1> Yes,  sometimes we have to learn to let go of the little things so we can appreciate the more important things. It sounds like you have done a great job! <0> Thank you, I was so excited since the first day she moved in. It was great having another person around. Loved her decorating and arranging she did too.

I wonder how common it is? <1> Not sure but there is no real cure there is limited treatment <0> What is the treatment? <1> In the US no medications or procedures only a little cognitive therapy
<0> I bought an E-book once, and had a terrible time trying to read it regardless of what device or software i used so i just gave up on it. <1> Yeah the original Nook I had back in 2009 seems archaic compared to just reading books on an iPad device.  <0> I much prefer a real booj these days <1> Yeah the original Nook I had back in 2009 seems archaic compared to just reading books on an iPad device. <0> Yeah you said as much, why do you like the ipad? <1> The ipad is easier than the Nook <0> Is it the swiping? <1> Yes it is  <0> Yeah, i do like an ebook, good to take lots on holiday <1> Bad thing about it is that you have to charge it all the time <0> Yeah, and if you forget your plug! <1> That is why I carry 2 plugs incase one gets broken
<0> I have brown hair, quite common I guess. <1> Yeah it is, it is the second most common, after black, which I have. <0> And what is the least common hair color? <1> I would say it is red hair since only 1-2% of the population has it. It's a shame because it is very pretty. <0> Yes It is.  I guess that is why some people dye their hair red.   Do you know what makes hair a specific color? <1> It has to do with pigment. So high levels of eumelanin makes the hair dark while lower levels of pheomelanin make the hair lighter. <0> okay cool.
<0> as I walk through my house,  the rooms are empty,  There is no one there for me <1> I'm so sorry you feel that way. Maybe you should talk to someone you trust. A family member or a friend.

<0> Hello!  Are you into baking cakes?   <1> I love to eat them, but I've never baked them before. It is difficult? <0> It is not that difficult.  You just have to use the correct ingredients like flour, eggs etc.  <1> What do you do with all of the ingredients? Do you throw them in a bowl? <0> You throw them in a bowl in the correct proportions, then put them in an oven, sort of like you would with a barbecue in a masonry oven.  <1> That doesn't sound too difficult. How long does it take to bake a cake? <0> It depends on the method you are using. You have to use prolonged dry heat in an oven, but it could be made even on hot ashes or stones.  <1> Wow.

<0> This past month, due to my consistent exercising i gained 8 pounds of muscle mass with the help of Whey protein powder. I am so proud for my accomplishment <1> That's wonderful! Congratulations! What kind of program did you do? <0> I didn't do any specific program, I just paid a little extra on my membership to get a personal trainer! <1> Nice, what made you decide to get a trainer as opposed to finding a program yourself? <0> Having a trainer made me stay consistent and kept pushing me even when I wanted to quit. <1> That makes sense.

Do you have a favorite Styx song or album? <1> Not really, I enjoy all of their stuff.

Red pigment use goes back quite a bit - it's one of the first colors found in prehistoric art. <0> I wonder if they used blood back them for red? <1> I believe they used ochre. However, anything that contains the protein hemoglobin appears red. The same is true for anything with anthocyanins. <0> That is really interesting, please tell me more <1> Well, it is the hemoglobin in blood for instance that makes it appear red. Anthocyanins are found in berries and autumn leaves. <0> That is really cool we have so much history. <1> It's true!

<0> I just gotta sleep it off, it's not severe for me. <1> Okay that's good. The amount of dairy a person who is lactose intolerant can tolerate varies from person to person. So you're pretty lucky! <0> Working in a doctors office helps with getting the correct information for my intolerance <1> Yeah. We should not consume more lactose as it has adverse effects on our body.  <0> Definitely!  What do you use an alternative to lactose? <1> Well, I always consume milk products in alternative to lactose. That works good for me. <0> Lactose is the sugar component of milk.  You should try banana milk; it's not that bad! <1> Of course I will love to try that. But it costs more I guess. What about the other alternative? <0> They have all sorts.  Banana, rice, soy, oat, coconut, cashew, almond,  lactose free, etc.   <1> Sounds great. I will try these too. How are you managing your diets with all these stuffs? <0> I just trust my gut, so to speak.

Do you listen to any other podcasts? <0> Yeah I listen to a couple of others.  I am always on the look out for a good one.
<0> Black hair is the most common color and the darkest hair color <1> Really?  Tell me more about this. <0> Black hair is a dominant trait and is found in people of all ethnicities <1> That makes sense. I wonder what is least common? <0> In English black hair is described as raven black or jet black <1> Raven black.  Interesting terminology.

Do you know what her first breakthrough song was? <1> One of her biggest first songs was Our Song and put her in the spotlight <0> really <1> I hope i get to see her live oneday <0> sure <1> where is she going to be preforming next? <0> i don't know.....do you know <1> I never look for concert tickets anymore because i usually end up going by myself <0> that's the good thing <1> I have trouble making eye contact with people sos i dont have many friends anyway. <0> person should have eye contact
<0> I have a dentist appointment next week. <1> Oi...I don't like doctors or the dentists. <0> I am a snakeskin oil salesman, could I interest you in a tonic? <1> What kind of tonic are you offering? <0> It helps with hair growth, increases brain performance, and brings good luck. Just 5 payments of 9.99 <1> Wow, that's 3 great things in one!  Is the fee negotiable? <0> Yes, absolutely. I stare at people from a distance. That is my idea of how to flirt. How about you? <1> No, that's kind of creepy.  How about $5.00? <0> I get that a lot. For you I will do 4.99. I will throw in 10 shamwows if you pay the shipping and handling. <1> What is a shamwow? <0> It is a legendary towel made popular by a television salesman. It is super absorbent.  <1> Sounds great, I bet I could re-sell it for 3 easy payments of $9.99.
<0> Would you like to know a cool fact about Ferrari? Ferrari is based Maranello. <1> Is that in Italy? <0> Yes it is. Another cool fact is that the first car badged with the logo was completed in 1947. <1> Interesting. How fast can A Ferrari go? <0> I do believe that the max speed is 202 mph. <1> How many Ferraris are made a year? <0> About 8000 give or take a few.
<0> During this past spring during a bad storm,  we had a tornado touch down in my neighbors yard. <1> Oh my gosh!  That had to be super scary! <0> It sounded like a train going by the house from the basement. Thankfully no one was hurt. <1> Yeah,  thank god you are safe.  I don't know what I would have done if that happened to me. <0> It was one of the scariest experiences of my life.
<0> Well,  not too bad. I felt really nervous the other day though. <1> Oh no,  what happened? <0> The cops pulled me over,  i thought something was wrong <1> Holy.. What did they want?
<0> where do you go volunteer ? <1> at the red cross . <0> That is amazing. Great organization. I am trying to find a place to volunteer. I was thinking a local animal shelter.  <1> that is very nice of you . it is good to volunteer . <0> Everyone should do something for their community. I'm good with animals seems like it might be a good fit.  <1> I totally agree. It helps the shelters from overcrowding. <0> There are so many it has been a bit daunting trying to pick one to help out. <1> Yea well you just have to start somewhere. <0> I have narrowed it down a bit. So hopefully soon I will start doing it instead of just talking about it. <1> You should get on that soon. <0> You are right! Thanks I will! Guess I just needed someone to push me a bit:) <1> Yea, no doubt we all need a little push once in a while  <0> Sometimes it takes a perfect stranger to start a change for someone. Thanks! <1> no problem . life is about helping each other . you have made my evening less lonely <0> But I just can't seem to do it
<0> There is a job promotion coming up. I really do wish i can get it <1> I hope you can have you applied or did you interview already?
<0> I am so upset with my children <1> That's no good. Why are you upset with them? <0> They were badly behaved in the car today. <1> Oh no! How old are they? <0> Eight, Five and a one year old <1> I am ten, so a little bit older than them. <0> Yes two years older than my eldest. Do you enjoy school? <1> I do not. But tomorrow is my first day of safety patrol so I am excited! <0> What is safety patrol? <1> We help the younger kids cross the street safely. <0> Oh that sounds like a great thing to do! Do you like helping people? <1> I do! It is the best. <0> What is your favourite school lesson? <1> Probably math, you can use it with so much!  Do your kids like math?
<0>  went for a job interview. I got the job offer but they offered me less money then I all ready make for more work. <1> But do they give raises more frequently and do they have better benefits. It may be worth it still,  <0> Not for the first few years. The title would be a move up in status but the pay is about a 20% downgrade. I can't take that loss. <1> Benefits are worth a lot more than you think sometimes
<0> Hi, Have you ever colored your hair?  <1> I've been coloring my hair for years, and I'm not the only one. Americans spend about 2 billion dollars on hair dye. <0> Wow, that's a lot of money for hair color. Do you do it yourself or at a salon? <1> That's er year! I do it at home. I have to do it every few weeks to cover those grays <0> My mom was a hair dresser. I learned there are so many different ways to color. Highlights, Frosting tips, bleaching and more. <1> And that's why a lot of folks do it professionally. I'd never try highlighting or frosting at home.
<0> I love to see old stuff from when I was a kid <1> Oh yeah? What kind of old stuff? <0> Old metal lunch boxes like Charlies Angels speed buggy ect <1> I always liked those old lunch boxes myself. Do you have a favorite?
<0> Red is my favorite color.  My house, car, and clothes are all red. <1> I also like red buddy, I have more red colour dresses <0> What do you think it is about red that makes it so appealing? <1> Red is visible of light, it is next to orange and opposite to violet <0> It's also the first color in the rainbow, roy g. biv, right? <1> Yes red is primary colour.What about pink colour are you like that <0> I don't mind pink.  My daughter however, goes crazy for pink.  It is her favorite color. <1> It also one of my favourite colour .my daughter also likr this color. It first used in late 17th century
<0> Last month my dog Skippy passed away. He was 18 years old. <1> Oh wow! My dog Jr died of old age too.
<0> What training do you need? <1> A lot of it is about having a high visibility presence so that people don't even TRY any crap with you! You want to always be on the lookout for signs of crime.... <0> That makes sense. Vigilance is a great preventative.  <1> I am a security guard so it is very important. <0> Are you concerned that you are going to be replaced with a security robot? I listened to a great 99% Invisible about them plus a documentary called Chopping Mall. <1> I have never thought of that. I just finished training so I should be ok for a few years. <0> Yeah I think you've got a lot of time. I worry about AI. I don't think that it'll be like Star Wars at all. <1> I think in the long run it will benefit society but there will be some issues along the way.  <0> There are just going to be tons of lost jobs and AI often has so much bias built in from the coding and learning process. <1> Yeah that could be an issue. How do you think governments and people can prepare? <0> we need to regulate the jobs that can be automated, we need a robust UBI and social safety net, and companies need to be much more careful about developing them. <1> That definitely makes a lot of sense. 
<0> hello , how are you tonight ? <1> i'm sick , thank goodness my husband is a doctor . stupid flu . <0> ugh , that's horrid . i'm sorry . do you play call of duty ? <1> no , i do play tennis professionally though . any sports for you ? <0> no , i do larp and conventions . <1> that sounds super fun ! i bet my kids would love it . i've so many . <0> they would ! i do comic con as well . you should bring them . <1> my family is growing yet again , twins . i cannot travel or i'd totally . <0> i do not have any kids , congratulations ! <1> thanks , they're expensive . we just had to move to a 3 storey home .
<0> I told my girlfriend about my self harm habits a little while ago. <1> How did she reacted to the admission to self harm?  <0> She was really sad,  but she appreciated the fact that I told her.  <1> Now that your girlfriend knows the problem,   the both of you can work on solutions and support together. <0> Yeah, she was really happy about it, even though she did not appreciate the fact that I told her.
<0> I fell asleep waiting for my plane at the airport and someone woke me up because i was snoring too loud. <1> haha.  Where they mad?  and how did you react? <0> They were really mad, yeah. I just told them that I fell asleep because I wanted to be ready for my flight to iceland <1> did you miss your flight? <0> No, I almost did though. I was practicing my cursive but I was just so bored I guess I fell asleep. <1> Practicing cursive? I thought everyone stopped using that. <0> They did, but I just really want to learn It's hopeless though because I do not understand how people can do that. <1> are you left handed or right handed? <0> I'm right handed, but trying to learn cursive with my left <1> sounds like you like torturing yourself. <0> Nah, I just want t olearn cursive becausse arrparently it's popular in Iceland and I have always wanted to live there. <1> sounds good are you really want to live there?
<0> hi there , how are you ? <1> i am good , just got back from playing basketball . <0> love basketball ! where do you live ? i'm in alabama <1> i live in arizona with my mom , she's a dentist <0> do you have any siblings ? i've a brother and sisters <1> no , i do not have any siblings <0> what is your favorite food ? <1> tacos , i am looking for a job at a restaurant . <0> that is my favorite too ! <1> I woke as a teacher
<0> i do in my spare time it rules <1> cool , i want to retire soon , how about you ? <0> not yet <1> This is my passion to retire in Hawaii after 10 years. I don't know why? <0> its looking good <1> I heard a lot about Hawaii but never visited the place. <0> i like hawaii and you <1> Never visited before but read a lot about it and heard about it from my friends. <0> yes, it is a beautiful place <1> Is living there expensive? <0> not really but average <1> Maybe I could move there at some point!
<0> hi there ! what is your name ? <1> hi my name is jessica . what is yours ? <0> my name is blake . what do you do for a living ? <1> i work at a restaurants called panera <0> oh , i've been there many times while on the road . do enjoy your job ?
<0> My child needs to start going to bed early to prep for school. Last night,  I caught her sneaking her phone and watching tv at 12am. <1> Oh man,  sounds like most kids. She's gonna hate it at first,  but getting to bed early will help with her future.
<0> Hi, I love Italian cuisine, especially pasta! <1> Do you like Marinara sauce or Alfredo? <0> Yes, especially the ones made with onions. <1> What about meat? <0> Yes, but it has to clean, cultured meat.  <1> Do you like meatballs in your pasta? <0> The only kind of pasta I like with meatballs is spaghetti, but this is an american dish.   <1> You can use ground beef too.
<0> This was several years back. I was single,  but I also like watching The Notebook type of movie,  so i thought it would be okay to go watch The Vow alone. Wrong! Horrible mistake. It was a tear jerker,  and I had no one there to see it and be like awe. All those tears wasted for nothing! lol <1> Aww... sorry to hear that. I haven't personally seen the show. What hit you the most? <0> Oh,  it was a movie about a woman who lost her memory,  and her husband had to get her to fall back in love with him. At the time,  I was like I want that; however,  now that I am in a relationship,  I am like I don't know about this. I wish she would get amnesia as well <1> Sounds like a touching but sad story. Love without two ways interaction is really hard. I can't imagine myself going through relationship like this honestly..
<0> I had my hair professionally colored to purple. Have you ever considered coloring your hair? <1> Wow that's definitely cool! I think hair dye is definitely a great way to express yourself! Whenever I was younger I colored my hair blond! <0> That's great! Hair coloring actually goes back far in history, a Greek historian Diodorus Siculus even mentioned how the Celtics dyed their hair blonde. <1> Wow, I had no idea, that's pretty cool. How old were you when you decided you wanted to dye it and how old were you when you actually ended up doing it? <0> Well I was 22 when I wanted to do it, and then I waited until I was 23, so not very long. <1> Well that's awesome, it's cool you actually did it. How has the overall reaction from people been since you've colored it?
<0> I have brown hair which is the second most common hair color. <1> Mine is more dirty blond - I wish it were either darker or lighter LOL!  And who came up with the term dirty blond, sounds well dirty LOL! <0> Brown hair strands are thicker than blonde but red hair strands are the thickest.  <1> I had no idea that the strands of different colored hair vary in thickness - I wonder why that is, do you know?
<0> Do you like baking. The most common item is bread but other types of food are baked also. <1> I love to eat baked goods, but am the world's worst baker! What other types of food are baked? <0> Cookies and cakes. The heat gradually transfers from the surface to the center in regular ovens to get that baked taste. <1> Wonderful. Any idea where the concept of baking things came from? <0> It has a familial past where women and some men make things in bakeries and restaruants for local consumption <1> That's interesting. My Great Grandfather was a baker. I wonder if that practice you mention still goes on somewhere in the world. <0> I think it later became industrialized and machines and baking was done in large factories later.
<0> That sounds like fun. Do you take lessons? <1> One needs to ,to be able,This broad description includes the use of horses for practical working purposes, transportation, recreational activities <0> sounds like a blast! i can't wait to take some of those lessons <1> Following a dream is a very good thing. I was being silly doing karaoke one night - -I am now a successful rapper <0> you are? that's cool. i've been taken raps lessons myself as well. :D  <1> I hope you get a chance to take riding lessons. Do you just dream of riding or do you want to compete at some level? <0> as a matter of fact, i'm riding a horse name Connie. we will be doing horse race next week <1> Have you been racing long?
<0> Ive been doing lots of physical fitness lately, It really is challenging but the reward of losing weight is worth it, Do you do any physical fitness? <1> I do fitness walking, but that's it.  What physical fitness activities do you do? <0> Well  do all kinds, I do strength fitness like running and weight lifting. I love the quality or state of being fit. It makes you feel so much better.  <1> I'm still waiting for it to make me feel better - right now all it does is make me tired! <0> Well Physical fitness generally does make you feel tired,  But you can achieve so much through proper nutrition, moderate-vigorous physical exercise, and plenty of rest. <1> Maybe I need to work on proper nutrition - chocolate bars for breakfast probably aren't ideal  LOL <0> Well you can get some fiber chocolate bars made of different components like cocoa solids, cocoa butter, sugar, and milk just as long as its low in calories.  <1> Hey, great idea!  I'll look for those when I go shopping later today!  Any other tips?
<0> I just hired a new hotel inspector,  he has very little experience but wants to learn. Scares me. <1> you took a risk huh? i hope he will be a great worker! That's good you gave him a chance <0> Yes,  I need more staff member and he was very nice. But if he does a bad job I get fired. <1> i hope it won't happen!  <0> I do too, we shall see what happens.
<0> hi . i don't like working as a car salesman . <1> i recently broke my arm so i'm not working <0> what happened ? it is hard to do anything with a broken arm . <1> i blame my skateboarding friends <0> do you think 40 is too old to go back to school ? <1> yes , you should retire and learn to knit <0> no money . once i get paid my wife goes shopping . never get married . <1> I'm just dating right now.
<0> I was at the store the other day and the lady ahead of me had no idea how to use self checkout,  I wish she would have used the regular line instead of holding everyone up. <1> Oh I hate when that happens. we go to self checkout to avoid things like slow lines. <0> Exactly! I wasn't in a hurry or anything but it felt so inconsiderate. <1> Hopefully the person learned what they had to do so they don't hold the line up in the future. <0> I think they need better instructions posted for newbies.
<0> I have heard of Maroon 5 before.. Is he the only singer? <1> He is the lead.  I think Sam Farrar does a lot of the harmony with him <0> They're a really good band. I like their music <1> I agree with you, old Maroon 5 was where the real pop goodness was had <0> Yeah, it's hard to find good new music these days <1> agreed , todays bands just aren't the same . <0> My husband and I used to go to a lot of shows before he passed, what kinds of concerts do you like? <1> so sorry to hear that, but i usually go for rock ones mostly. <0> That's cool, any favorites? <1> Breaking benjamin by far they really get me, ya know?
<0> Red is one of my favorite colors and it is next to orange on the spectrum of light. <1> I love red too. <0> I think I prefer blue but red is one of my favorite colors, even light red. <1> Yea they are both great since they have so many shades and arent tacky. <0> Agreed, it is also a primary color. <1> Yea its very popular with people and in nature a bit too <0> Oh definitely, with it's 625 to 740 wavelength. That's approximately the dominant wavelength.
<0> I've been working hard and doing a great job for several months,  but still no raise. <1> thats always a bummer when you put in such work and get nothing in return  <0> Yeah,  especially when my boss promised to pay me more. Might be time to quit! <1> Oh I just quit a few weeks ago due to a similar situation actually! Never been happier!  <0> It sounds like you made the right decision. I envy your willingness to take the risk.
<0> I get so mad when I watch shows about animal shelters and see how many people abuse animals. <1> I own an animal shelter here in my home town.
<0> I hit my toe on the edge of the doorway and it bent backwards. I was furious and crying at the same time! <1> That must have hurt a lot.Did you go to the hospital?  <0> No,  I don't have insurance. Just like when I twisted my ankle on the stairs and fell. It took months to heal,  but it healed.
<0> Hello, do you really have purple hair? <1> No but I like hair dyeing. <0> I see, are you a hair stylist? Or is it just something you enjoy doing? <1> I am a hairdresser that does hair coloring. <0> Oh that sounds neat, how long have you been doing that? Did you go to school?  <1> I studied cometology in school. It is beauty treatment. <0> Yes it is. I have a cousin who is also a hairdresser. She seems to like her job. Do you think more people get their hair dyed these days than compared to let's say, 20 years ago? <1> Yes because there are lot more beauty salons such as spas. <0> Do you think it's safer today to dye your hair than it was 20 years ago?
<0> Red is such a pretty color, don't you think? <1> I like that its wavelenght is 625-740 nanometres. <0> Oh wow! That's a new one for me! How many different shades are there? <1> I am not sure but red is a primary color. <0> Yep, along with yellow and blue right? <1> Yes, the RGB color model is an additive color model. <0> Don't they use that in old projection tvs to produce the screen images? <1> I think so, the main purpose of the RGB color model is for the sensing, representaion and display of images in electronic systems. <0> Cool, cool. So what colors mix with red to make other colors? <1> I have no idea. I don't really know much about colors. 
<0> I got a new position at my job more money and also happy to be recognized for my hard work.  <1> YAY,  a promotion is always amazing.  when do you start? <0> I actually started today it was a lot of information to take in but it was such a joy.  <1> Thats amazing,  financial stability can be a life changer. <0> Tell me about it, I couldn't have ask for it any other way.
<0> yes . i cook various items . what do you cook ? <1> i already finished school , my mom live with me now . <0> That's nice, do you take of her? I'm still in school and love it. <1> Yes, I cook for her and take her places. She is getting older so it is harder for her to do things alone. <0> it's good she has you.   <1> Thank you, I appreciate it. I'm just trying to help her since she helped me for so many years. Seems fair. <0> You're a kind person. When did your mom move in with you?
<0> I like Ferrari. It is an Italian sport car <1> those are really beautiful. i prefer Lamborghini though  <0> OK, Ferrari was founded by Enzo Ferrari in 1939 <1> Wow, long time ago! Do you know any other fun facts about ferrarri <0> The first Ferrari was built in 1940 <1> where were they build? In Italy?
<0> they sure do , i'm retired computer programmer so i go all out . <1> that is fun do you like music <0> I love the old tunes, back from when I was young <1> Nice, I play the violin and love music as well. <0> My granddaughter plays the violin! <1> Cool, well my grandmother raised me so that's neat. I like 80s music a lot. <0> My daughter graduated in the 80's, if you want some clue as to how old I am haha <1> Oh that's nothing. Age is just a state of mind I say. <0> You're a good kid, I should bake you cookies! I love the British Baking shows <1> Well I will take them. I love just about all cooking shows but I hate to cook. Weird huh? <0> Sure is!
<0> red is one of the best colors <1> I agree, I think its because its at the end of the visible spectrum of light <0> yes, and really plainly it is pretty awesome, and does have meaning behind it <1> Yes, in the Renaissance, the brilliant red costumes for the nobility and wealthy so it did have meaning. <0> I wonder if there is a significant meaning today? <1> The red sky at sunset results from Rayleigh scattering which is important part of physics today. <0> I am pretty sure there is red in the rainbow as well <1> You're right, plus iron oxide also gives the red color to the planet Mars. I wish I could do there myself!
<0> We moved into a 200 year old house. There are creeks and cracks that creep me out! <1> I can only imagine. At least its nice in the day time though? <0> Sometimes. I try to avoid that attic during any time of the day! There's also a weird door about knee-height. When you open it up,  it's just big enough to fit a storage tub. <1> I am not sure I would do well in that house <0> Sure, you will. The house might be Old but still have a very good structure and some lovely design that are hard to find in the modern houses,
<0> yes a few of them do i play on their computer . my mom teaches math <1> awesome . she must help you a lot with school . <0> No. She is harder on me than the rest of the kids because she doesn't want them to think I'm the pet <1> Oh, I see. Your mom is an angel! <0> IDK about that part. She is a nice lady, but I don't like her as a teacher she is mean. <1> i have a teacher that comes to my house to teach me as i am bedridden <0> Oh wow. Are you sick? <1> yes i have a severe sickness <0> That is bad. I will pray for you. I hope you get better. <1> thanks. i like it when my dog and cat visit me in bed
<0> I would love a Ferrari! It is an Italian sports car manufacturer based in Maranello. <1> I'd love one too! Which model would you buy? <0> I think I might want a Diablo! It was founded by Enzo Ferrari in 1939 out of Alfa Romeo's race division as "Auto Avio Costruzioni" <1> Wow! I had no idea Ferrari has been around that long! Do you know how many cars the company produces per year? <0> I dont think it is a ton since the are so expensive! but In 2014, Ferrari was rated the world's most powerful brand in the world <1> That's very impressive! Why do you suppose that is? Is it the company's wealth? <0> Im not sure about wealth but I know Fiat S.p.A. acquired 50% of Ferrari in 1969! <1> I didn't realize Fiat owned that much of Ferrari!
<0> Red is my favorite color and it varies from scarlet to crimson and can vary in shade from red pink to burgundy. <1> It reminds me of Chinese New Year, Christmas, and Valentine's Day. <0> Yes I often associated red with those holidays as well. I also find it interesting that iron oxide gives the color red to the planet Mars. <1> The planets, too, huh. I hadn't thought about that. <0> Red is apparently quite an important color as it was made from ochre and one of the first colors used in prehistoric art. <1> I've heard it was a color that showed wealth, but I don't really know if that is true.
<0> One time they put cheese in my hamburger when I told them not to! <1> Wow,  how could they do that? <0> They are complete monsters I tell ya! <1> Someone's gotta put an end to that poor service! <0> The are perfect.
<0> That's interesting. I didn't know that is what it's called. What else can you tell me? <1> unlike violet, which is a spectral color with its own wavelength on the visible spectrum of light, purple is a composite color made by combining red and blue. <0> interesting, what other colours do you like <1> My favorite color used to be blue, but I started liking purple more after becoming a Prince fan. Do you like Prince? <0> yes, i love purple rain <1> That was a good movie. Did you ever get a chance to see him in concert? <0> sadly no, what about you? <1> Yes, I got to see him when I lived in NC, and took all of my grandchildren. It was a great show. <0> nice! do you like playboi carti? <1> Not a big fan, but he's okay. Are you a big fan?
<0> I recently saved my money and bought a Ferrari! It's an italian sports car. <1> Oh wow! I bet that is nice. What color is it? <0> It's fire engine red! Ferrari was actually named the most powerful brand in 2014. <1> What else can you tell me about the brand? <0> Ferrari was founded  in 1939 by Enzo Ferrari. <1> I did not realize it was that old? How much did they cost back then? <0> I'm really not sure but Ferrari was previously owned by Fiat but in 2016, became a separate company. <1> Do you know if they sell very many each year? <0> Probably not considering the the 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO became the most expensive car in history. <1> is  Ferrari a international brand  or  only  Italian  brand.      
<0> Hello did you ever get to go to Disney when you were young? <1> No,  I don't get any golden opportunity. did you  ? 
<0> Do you ever feel that now you have finally grasped what life really is.. <1> I can't say that I really do. It's always a mystery in my mind. <0> Or is the sign of overconfidence,  like they say,  -  there are two types of bikes,  those that were in an accident,  and those that will be? <1> I believe I see it more as that type. No one can truly know. <0> The world is crazy, who knows what will happen.

Did something happen or did he miss you!? <0> His business trip wrapped up a few days earlier than planned. <1> I see.I bet you and him are happy to be able to spend a little time together.  <0> Yes, though he looked really tired.
<0> I have quite a lot of energy, but I know some people just aren't as lucky. Is their a medical condition for being constantly tired? <1> I think it's called Chronic Fatigue Syndrom, or CFS.  I don't know a lot about it, but it makes people tired for long-term amounts of time. <0> That must be awful. I wonder what causes it. Depression perhaps? <1> I don't think the cause is fully understood.  It could be genetic, could be biological, or it could be psychological. <0> Well, I guess the medical profession had better get to the bottom of it. It must be destroying people's lives! <1> I'm sure it is, but people are starting to see that behavioral therapy and a slow increase in activity can help counteract the effects. <0> That makes sense. If a person exercises it often brings ones energy levels up.
<0> Recently I've been enjoying being by myself. <1> I like my alone time too. What do you enjoy doing by yourself? <0> I just love people watch,  if that's considered alone time. <1> Oh that's is fun. It's a way to be alone with your thoughts,  but still be around others. I love to watch people!  <0> that sounds interesting
<0> The only piercings I have are a single piercing in both of my ears. How about you? <1> I have three ear piercing - one in one ear, two in the other. <0> That's cool. Do you have any tattoos?  <1> I do not have any tattoos and don't really plan on getting one ever. Do you have any? <0> No I don't but I have been thinking about getting one. Do you smoke?  <1> Smoking is quite bad for you so I prefer not to. <0> That's great! I used to smoke but I don't anymore. Do you have any bad habits that you're trying to quit? 
<0> I have a twin in real life and when people see us together, I get real sick of them asking if we are twins! <1> How interesting! A developing fetus is called a singleton if they are alone but a multiple if there is more than one developing! <0> Those embryos sure like multiplying! I wonder if twins are more rarer than triplets? <1> Well, the twin birth rate in the US rose from 18.9 to 33.3 for every 1,000 births between 1980 and 2009 <0> Wow, do you know what caused the spike in the rate? Is it a genetic thing? <1> I'm not sure but the Yoruba people have the highest twin rate in the world possibly because they eat a yam that contains a natural phytoestrogen <0> Lol, you can eat a fruit that increases the chance of getting twins. That is funny. I heard there is different types of twins too like identical and I forgot the name of the other one? <1> I think they are called paternal twins?
<0> I've heard of them but haven't listened to their music. <1> Theyre great, they are an American heavy metal band and really pushed metal into the light of the general public and help make it a huge genre. <0> Have you ever seen them live? <1> Unfortunately not , money is tight at the moment ! It’s a massive dream of mine however !   <0> It's crazy and worth it for sure! I've only seen them once in Nashville but I'd say it was the best show I've ever been to. <1> Wow that sounds great , must be a really exhilarating experience, congratulations! Planning on seeing anyone else in the future ? <0> I do plan on going to Washington DC on New Years to see Skrillex. Different genre but still a good show!

I want to be a veterinarian when I grow up. <1> that will be cool , are you looking at any schools to go to ? <0> I have my eyes on a few but I have to discuss it with my parents <1> It is pretty expensive to go to get this type of schooling and it takes a while , but I feel you will enjoy it .  <0> I hope so. What do you do for work? <1> I am a artist and I farm I have cattle ,pigs, a few horse.It is nice
<0> i crave cheeseburgers . what food do you crave ? <1> fish and chips are my weakness . <0> i watch crime dramas and war documentaries . what are your favorite tv shows ? <1> anything that is a documentary of christopher columbus , he is a relative . <0> have you told many people about this relation ? <1> of course . it is no secret in my family , especially among my european relatives . <0> i help out at the local soup kitchen . do you volunteer too ? <1> i used to cook paella for a kitchen in spain . <0> i never heard of paella . what is it ? <1> it is a fish and seafood stew . <0> That sounds delicious, how long have you been cooking for?
<0> My friend got a hole in one the other day.  It was just his second time ever playing golf!  Talk about unexpected. <1> Good for him! The only time I've ever gotten a hole in one in golf is on a video game.  <0> Ah yes. I have played my share of video games as well. We get snowed in often in where I live in Vermont. <1> I like the video version because you can play anywhere, anytime. So you are an avid golf player as well? or just your friend?  <0> We are trying to visit all us national parks starting with ones next to golf coarses. We have been to 12 so far. <1> very ambitious! you are traveling with family then? that can be tricky - schedule and some want to rest, sleep in. <0> Not always family, friends mostly. What other video games are you into? <1> I looked up: Golfing in our National Parks | National Park Foundation. It seems to be quite a number of parks. Me, various - down time on flights. <0> Do you travel alone? Is if for work? <1> for work. sales person. pharmaceutical. some days hum-drum. other days, depending on location, it's a pick-me-up all by itself. :-D <0> Hum, do you enjoy that? Do you get to fly first class? Gotta grab joy where you can. <1> enjoy, mostly. first class. how about you and friends that are getting away? for how long? sounds like enjoyment. what do you do for work?

<0> It was only 2 years ago that I started hitting gym to pursue physical fitness in my lifestyle <1> That's incredible, its important to stay in shape, I work out and maintain a Ketogenic diet for the sake of my wellbeing. <0> I only got Whey protein powder for beginning and planned a diet that consisted only of products rich in protein <1> Honestly, whey protein is unnecessary unless you are a top level athelete, MCT oil and natural proteins are much more bioavailable for energy <0> I didn't know that. Nevertheless, thanks to Whey, I gained 6.6 pounds of muscle mass <1> Yeah but the Siege of Buda 1849 was a bloodbath, think about how much muscle mass was LOST in that battle!

Maybe you can join me to see the pyramids. <0> Seems like a strange thing to ask. But no, I personally cannot afford to go on big trips out of the country. <1> That's fair. How close are you with your sister? <0> Were pretty close, I talk to her a few times a month but she lives out of state so. <1> Oh. Perhaps you can go visit her and visit that new place. Does their new place have a pool? <0> Yeah, I might go sometime in a few months when I save up some cash, No theres no pool but its really close to some cool hiking trails <1> Oh nice. Yes traveling cost must be quite hefty. Are you into hiking?  <0> Yes! I really enjoy hiking, spending hours in nature. <1> I enjoy hiking as well!
<0> I have only dyed my hair once. nothing permanent a rinse really. WOuld you dye your hair <1> yes I have but the reason was  to cover my white  hair <0> I love seeing silvery white hair. My kids laugh at me because I have two strands and I brush my hair to make sure they show. LOL. What color did you use? <1> I used black because my hair used to be all black but now it's all white and im barely 45 years old. My hairdresser does  a good job of coloring it for me once every 2 months  <0> Ok. What do you think about using colors like purple or pink, which are not natural hair colors? <1> I prefer that is dyed black because it's more professional for me because of my line of work. if i was a musician or private business owner I would have gone with purple <0> Oh I see, so what do you do for work that needs your hair to be dyed in such a professional color?

<0> I lived with this girl once and I trusted her. Found out I never should have. <1> Oh, sorry to hear that man. Yeah girls are hard to trust these days. What's up with that? <0> I don't know? I guess school and stress just gets to people sometimes. <1> Yeah it can be more than a normal temporary reaction to life events. Although I try to keep perspective like a lot of people struggle with this and worse problems. <0> I know. Just hard to believe that my roommate would be rummaging through my things. I wonder if she has been stealing from me? <1> its totally possible. Did you get to find out why she did that? <0> I haven't spoken with her about it yet. I just caught her on video going through my desk. How do you bring something like that up? <1> definitely possible <0> I don't like confrontation, and this is not a discussion I am looking forward to having. But I have to stand up for myself. <1> have you tried confronting her? <0> I tried to bring it up yesterday but she was in a hurry to get out the door. <1> i'd suggest you find a time you're sure she's not going out and talk about it

<0> Do you know anything about dairy farming? <1> I know a lot actually, dairy farming class of agriculture for long-term production of milk. <0> That sounds interesting! I always wondered how butter was made and why humans drink another animals milk! <1> Yeah its kinda odd if you really think about it. and other species that commercially make milk are goats, sheep and camels. <0> Oh yeah I forgot about all those, I suppose they would be present on a dairy farm as well!

I can't get enough of the catchy drum beats and electrical guitars. <0> I was a teenager in the 70's and love classic rock. Bands like Lynard Skynard <1> What is your favorite instrument in rock songs? <0> The electric guitar is definitely my favorite! Do you go to concerts? <1> Yes I love concerts. My first one was Led Zeppelin in 1973, I saw them play Stairway to Heaven live! It's considered one of the best rock songs ever. <0> I have mixed feelings about that song. My first concert was Kiss in 1975. Gene Simmons shot flames from his mouth about 15 feet. It was amazing. <1> That must have been very impressive! Have you see more bands from that era? I also saw Aerosmith play in Boston in 1974, it was an amazing show considering that is where they were formed.
<0> I really like the number 7. Can you tell me anything about it? <1> its a natural number preceding 8 and following 6 <0> I think it is a lucky number. Wonder why 7 is associated with luck. <1> Not sure? The hindus in the beginning wrote 7 in one stroke as a curve <0> I see. I have seen 7 written with a line through it as well. How interesting. <1> Arabs write it with horizontal upper line  <0> That is what I have seen. So the Arabs started that. I love the arabic numeral system. <1> You're in luck, I studied it extensively.

Heavy music lets me cut loose. <1> I've only listened to alternative myself, do you recommend any artist? <0> Start with the classics. Black Sabbath, Motorhead, Metallica, Iron Maiden.  <1> Great, I will check them out for sure!  Who is your favorite artist?
<0> I have got a new job! You know anything about conductors? <1> Hmm you must be pretty brave to take a job without knowing the job description. As a conductor you will be a train crew member responsible for operational and safety duties that do not involve actual operation of the train. <0> Well, my uncle got me the job. He did not tell me any of this! I am supposed to start tomorrow so was trying to find out info on it. What else do you know, deciding to be nervous or not... <1> Good for you! Your responsibilities  as a conductor will include: making announcements and opening and closing doors. Pretty simple, no need to be nervous. <0> Phew! My mind is at ease. The doors, I can do with no issues. Safety issues is the part that scares me lol, I can barely keep my plants alive <1> As a conductor you will usually stay in the center of the train where you will be able to best view the platform. I hope you have good eyes!

Too hard on my back <0> Yes. My brother has the same problem. He has herniated discs.
<0> I lent my car to my 17-year-old sister today. She left at 10 in the morning and it's midnight, and she still isn't back with it. I trust her mostly, but she hasn't been driving for long, and it makes me nervous thinking of her out there on the road <1> Did you call her? I hope she's ok! <0> I made a call to some of the other troopers to be on the look out during their patrol.. I'm just ready to hear back from her <1> What kind of car is she driving? Hopefully they will find her soon <0>  She was driving my '10 Volvo, so it's a safer car. I made her download one of those "Don't Text and Drive" apps, <1> Oh a Smart Car!

I usually take one before I go to sleep. <1> Do you prefer a hot shower or cold shower at that point then? <0> I usually take a hot shower in the morning in order to bathe myself and warm up. What about you, do you usually take your showers at morning or night? <1> I usually take them in the morning and I tend to take hot showers, though I've heard positive effects of cold showers. <0> Ancient people used to use cold water out of jugs in order to shower. <1> That makes a lot of sense. I wonder how much better that cold water might be than hotter showers.

<0> People don't think enough about early child care.  Quaility care at a young age can have a big impact on the child's future success. <1> I agree my kids have been in daycare from 2 months and up and once my oldest got age 2 I changed her to a private christian academy education is so important.  <0> Typically children are taken care of by parents or siblings, but daycare is very popular in the U.S. <1> It became popular because of the fact parents have to go to work the rates are sky high as well.  <0> Oh yeah, day care is basically the term that describes that.  it's a service usually during specific hours for while the parents are at work. <1> You have a few that services 24 hour but rarely, I think tat's what come into play also in child care as you mentioned earlier where parents lack but some can't afford that fee or it doesn't fit their schedule. <0> It's really tough when people can't afford daycare, and they're left with the double burden of working to earn money, but are stuck with domestic labor too, like child raising. <1> It is and alot of them need that help and support but just don't have it I know here in Florida they offer child care assistance but I'm not sure about all over or in other states.  <0> State-provided child care assistance is becoming more popular in the US.

They don't serve alcoholic drinks where I work, but I serve all the others! Sometimes large families also. <1> I see, you have a very important role in a restaurant. I hope you are paid well for it! <0> Well you know, most of my income I get from tips. I do pretty well with those, fortunately. How is your work? <1> it sort of pays well , but as long as i can pay the bills i'm happy . <0> Yeah every penny account , in the grand scheme of things.
<0> I am helping a friend that has lost his job recently. <1> That's very kind of you. How long has he lost his job? <0> he has been out of work for about 2 months now <1> That is tough. It is nice of you to help him out. <0> have you ever lost your job? <1> No I haven't. But I'm sure it is a trying time. <0> What do you like to do when you aren <1> I like to cook.

My favorite breed is  a pitbull.   THey are so loyal  and sweet although  lots of people claim they are mean and vicious . <0> How can you like those. They're so scary.
<0> Ferraris are extremely expensive italian sports cars.  Have you ever owned one? <1> I wish, it's my dream car. Do you know who founded the company? <0> Founded by Enzo Ferrari in 1939.  They also manufacture Fiats, which are more in my price range. <1> I used to think Fiat was French just like Peugot, I never knew it was Italian. Wow amazing <0> Ferrari was actually branded as the worlds most powerful in 2014.   <1> we learn everyday.
<0> I've heard of it, but I'm not clear on what it is they do. <1> Goodwill Industries provide many services. They offer employment placement, job training, and help others in community based programs find jobs. <0> That sounds like a great idea. Can you tell me more about Goodwill Industries? <1> Goodwill Industries help hire other who may lack education or face employment challenges. It helps them with work skills in that way. <0> Thats incredible! I am looking for a job at the moment.

I hope it wasn't too bad for you! <0> It  wasn't that bad in the end,  but it was the fear of not remembering anything!  <1> I understand that all too well! I'm glad it wasn't too bad though. I've had some pretty embarrassing things happen while hungover. <0> What has happened that was embarrassing when you were hungover?

<0> I enjoy a lot of Snoop Dogg's older music, "Gin and Juice" is a great song! Do you like rap? <1> I like older stuff from that era <0> Same, I enjoy East Coast more, but West Coast was great too. Dr. Dre's production was always amazing. <1> Yeah, nothing really beats that early stuff from Dre, The Chronic and CHronic 2001 are my favorites <0> No doubt.

<0> Niagara Falls is one the most beautiful places i have ever been. <1> Oh yes it is but Ive only seen it in pictures. <0> It has three waterfalls that straddle the international border between Canada and the United States. <1> That is very interesting information. <0> The Horseshoe Falls is the mos impressive, it lies on the border of the United States and Canada with the American Falls entirely on the United States' side. <1> I really must go one day to see the beauty you speak of. <0> It is a very popular attraction,  more than six million cubic feet (168,000 m) of water goes over the crest of the falls every minute. <1> That is very interesting information about Horseshoe Falls.

But they don't like my dog very much because she poops in their yard like the sneak she is <1> Haha yeah that'll upset anyone I guess. Could you arrange to borrow one from a family member? <0> I think I am going to check on Marketplace <1> What's marketplace? Is that on Facebook? <0> It is on Facebook. You can list or buyitems from there. I buy clothes and just about anything <1> That sounds almost as risky as going to a pawn shop to me. I don't trust people on Facebook.

Do you experiment with different hardness to get varying effects? And what paper do you prefer? <1> I just use a normal pencil mostly because I just doodle.  I use just regular paper <0> Doodling is a *great* way to think! Have you ever looked into sketchnoting? It's a visual way to capture information, and makes listening a lot more interesting and fun. <1> I have never heard of that and will have to check it out.  I love the google doodle that they put on their homepage <0> Agreed! They have Doodler-in-Chief at Google who shepherds the process.

I also heard that sometimes people combine baking with grilling to create a hybrid barbecue effect. Strange but fascinating. <0> I didnt know about this, well theres always ways to change the texture of the most common foods, sometimes when we do not have our hoven, we pan frye the bread, and taste simular to when you bake it! <1> That's amazing. I prefer the professional touch of home bakers, since now most baking is automated by machines in factories. <0> Yes you can taste the diference in the baking hoven, pizzerias for example bake in wooden hovens and tastes so unique! <1> I definitely agree! I just found out that baking has traditionally been done by women at home, and by men in bakeries and restaurants. Kinda sexist but it's nice that it's different now. <0> Yes you know that usually hand made labor it was for women, but noadays one of the most famous bakery shops are own by men, like the ones you see on tv, so the world is changing while the hovens remain the same! <1> Yeah, good to know that you are thriving through.

I usually use the oven. <0> I also use baking in combination with grilling to make a hybrid type of barbecue.  Do you mix up cooking techniques?  <1> Prince (musician) <0> Um, I've never cooked Prince before. But like I said, I like to use grilling also which is dry heat applied to food.  <1> I did, he reminds me of the old days. I don't cook him though, I only listen to his music! <0> Yeah, but back to the topic, baking is related to barbecuing because the oven is similar to a smoke pit.   <1> I like to listen to Prince while I bake cookies, thats interesting, I did not know barbecuing was related to baking.

Since the 20's it's been recognized as such. <0> yes.there are several types of jazz music ,like cid Jazz ,, Avant-Garde Jazz. Big Band. Blue Note  <1> I love how Jazz is characterized by those swing and blue notes and all of the improvisation.  It truly stands apart from other genres. <0> definitely,the harmony of the music is very attractive.the melody also unpredictable. <1> Yep and the roots from West African musical expression are also evident.  Some may also be surprised that European Military band music was also an influence.

I am into yoga and running a lot <0> Never got into the yoga experience but I can see where that will help with balance of the mind and body <1> It is great because anyone at any age can do it.  <0> Same with working out or running. Just the pace and amount you do will differ with age.

<0> I enjoy jazz music. My love for jazz started way back in middle school when I played trombone in my school's Jazz Band. <1> Cool was it a big band or a smaller one like a trio or quartet? <0> It was a decent sized band, approximately 25 students. We traveled all around the state performing at competitions. Do you enjoy jazz? <1> Yeah I like the improvisational nature it has. Many jazz musicians are seriously talented. <0> No kidding. My wife and I recently took a trip to the Mississippi Delta area, and the amount of jazz history in the area is astounding. We stayed in Natchez, Mississippi. <1> Cool, did you see any artifacts from the Natchez people? They were indigenous people that had complex chiefdom systems.

<0> An actual ice cream man came through my neighborhood! I didn't think they still exist. <1> I don't think that I have seen/heard one of those since the 90s... Possibly the early 2000's at the earliest! Crazy,  I didn't know that they still exist either! <0> Right? Seeing the kids come running out really made me miss when I was little and got all excited about the ice cream man! <1> I loved that too! <0> well
<0> My husband really loves the Ferrari brand of sports car - do you have any preferences? <1> For sports cars i dont really have a strong preference, i think they all look really cool. sports cars i dont see alot. i livein a small town <0> Ferrari built their first car in 1940 - so they've been on the market quite a while - what kind of cars do you see in your town? <1> i see alot of older cars. you see a mix of nicer ones like theres some BMWs that drive around and some jaguars. What is your favorite car? <0> Although the Ferrari 1962 250 GTO is the most expensive car in history, my choice is probably a Jeep Wrangler. <1> im a jeep girl all the way! jeep stands for just empty every pocket. they can be very expensive.
<0> When i look at my son doing great in studies,  it makes me so proud! <1> How old is he?
<0> I have brown hair. It is very common in human beings. <1> Same here, brown hair is super common too. <0> That's what I said, haha. I wish I had red hair. I think it looks really cool. <1> My bad haha. I think so too, red hair is not nearly as common as brown or black hair but I wish it was. <0> I think red hair is mostly present in northern climates. It is pretty rare where I live. <1> I better move there then haha. Also brown hair can really vary in color for light to almost black. <0> Mine is on the lighter side. The sun makes it look almost blonde at times. <1> Me too! My brown hair used to be blonde when I was younger. <0> That seems to happen a lot. I wonder what causes hair to change color like that. <1> It is probably something in the hair pigments?
<0> My ex took me to six flags and wanted me to ride on a very high roller coaster. <1> Interesting....did you do it <0> Yeah,  but only because he was getting mad at me. I hate heights and I was very unsure about it. <1> lol why would he get mad...but did you have fun in the end <0> Yes, my boyfriend made me feel safe before the ride started by telling me funny jokes.
<0> I'm a college student right now, so I really like pasta since it's cheap and easy to make <1> Yep, pasta is a very versatile and delicious italian cuisine <0> Well it's nice because if you want to impress a date, you can easily do that by making a pasta dish <1> Haha yep so many pasta dishes you can make easily and its so simple with just some noodles and protein/sauce <0> Funny enough, I usually prefer it just without protein. I just like noodles only <1> Oh really? Its a staple italian food but not usually by itself, what about sauce? <0> I usually just get some store-bought Bertoli's or Prego and put my own additional seasonings in it, like oregano, garlic powder, black pepper, etc. <1> Oh ok that sounds pretty good though when it comes to traditional pasta cuisine i prefer it with a meat sauce
<0> My mom called me about a year ago and told me she had cancer. <1> Is she doing okay now? <0> Yes,  she had a really difficult 6 months and then things started improving.  <1> great,  I am very glad to hear she is getting better! <0> I am happy as with the improvement as well.
<0> Hello, so what are your thoughts on pasta? <1> I love pasta, it is such a versatile food! I really enjoy Italian food for its great flavors, and of course, it involves lots of pasta! <0> True, me too.  We have an Italian shop around the corner and I see them making fresh pasta.  Delicious! <1> Oh wow I have never seen that before! How do they make fresh pasta? <0> It's working the pasta dough and flattening or elongating it with a pasta machine attached to a bench.  What pastas do you usually get>? <1> Interesting, I didn't know that, thanks! I typically get traditional pasta, like fettuccine, with Alfredo sauce. What about you? <0> Rigatoni, angel hair (my favorite), and tortellini are some of my favs.  As for sauces, I love alfredo, but a good tomato sauce is great too! <1> Those are all delicious. I love tortellini because they are filled with a ton of delicious things. Whats your favorite type of tortellini?
<0> My bank has called me three times a day for the past week,  and I'm tired of it. <1> Probably they noticed some irregular or even fraudulent activities associated with your account <0> No,  I prequalified for a mortgage,  and they've been wanting me to speak to a loan specialist ever since. <1> Are you interested in mortgage for now?
<0> i miss my childhood and living with my parents <1> Yeah those were the days. When we had no worries in the world. <0> yes indeed.  i wish i had my treehouse back that my dad built for me.  i would live in it.
<0> I have brown hair, the second most common hair color, but I wish I had black hair. <1> I also have dark hair. What is that you like more about black hair? <0> I just like black hair because it is the most common of hair colors. <1> Interesting, is there anything else you can tell me about hair colors? <0> Red hair is the least common and only occurs in about 2% of the population. <1> Wow! What about blonde hair?
<0> My favorite food is pasta, its the staple of traditional italian cuisine, i like carbonara the most <1> I love pasta, what is Carbonara, is it the type of noodle itself? <0> Carbonara is a pasta dish from rome, its made with an egg, hard cheese, bacon and pepper, its really grat! <1> What is hard cheese? Like a block cheese like cheddar? I love eggs, I can see myself liking eggs and noodles together. <0> Its really tasty you should try it..Hard cheese is Parmesan, usually for this dish Pecorino Romano cheese. <1> I would have never thought of Parmesan as a hard cheese, you've blown my preconceptions of cheese out the window! <0> Well american parmesan is not so hard, but real italian one is really hard, granular cheese, full of taste also <1> You're making me hungry for some Italian food now, I'm not sure if risotto rice is italian but that stuff is bomb.  <0> Italian cuisine is awesome, italian food is the best food in the world for me, italian cuisine got its roots from antiquity! <1> I really like Asian food - a lot of pork, fish, and noodles. Do you like any of that?
<0> I really want to get into jazz music but there's so much to learn. <1> There is a lot. It all started in New Orleans from the African American communities. <0> That's interesting! I've also heard there are multiple types of jazz. What kind would you say you prefer? <1> I really enjoy ragtime. Jazz really has roots there from their culture. <0> I don't think I have ever heard of that. I'll need to check it out. Who are some famous Jazz musicians you would recommend? <1> Louis Armstrong was pretty famous. He was pretty much the foundation in jazz known for playing his trumpet. <0> Now he I have heard of. Other than trumpets, what instruments would I typically hear in a jazz song? <1> Well I'm sure you would hear some piano, bass guitar. It is really an original art form.
<0> I'm so happy about going to the lake with my wife, it makes me burst with joy! <1> That sounds like fun! What are you planning to do at the lake. <0> Go camping, do a little fishing. Do you like to fish? <1> I did when I was younger but I am far too old now. <0> I didnt think you could get too old lol  <1> I'm in my early 90's, so if I fell out of the boat I'd be meeting Jesus! <0> what do you like to do for fun? <1> I like to walk my dog and play with my grandchildren and great grandchildren! <0> Fun! How many grand babies? <1> Seventeen! <0> oh wow! Congratulations, im sure they keep you busy! 
<0> Hey there!! How are ya? <1> Hey there! i'm very good! What do you know about the manta ray? <0> Not much really but it was the only thing to choose from. <1> Well it seems there are two different main types. One of them is very large and the other decently small. <0> Okay so you know some about them. Great!! Have you ever seen one in the ocean before? <1> I have seen the larger ones in the ocean and the smaller ones in aquariums. These things are super protected by government agencies in the wild and domestic. <0> I didn't know that. Are the endangered then? <1> Not quite, but they will be very soon. They have a very slow reproductive rate so it takes awile for new ones to be had. <0> That's unfortunate. I wonder if over fishing or pollution is the cause of their decline besides low reproductive rates?
<0> I was furious when my brother lit a firecracker tying it to our dog's tail <1> thats an awful thing to do! what did you do? <0> I gave him a punch right away. thats no way to treat animals. <1> i am so glad that you did  <0> I'm glad I did too.  I punched him because I enjoy treating animals poorly and I was jealous.
<0> I'm feeling a lot more tired than I usually have been. I'm worried I might have an illness of some kind, like chronic fatigue. <1> Thats not good, A doctor can usually diagnose you based on a your symptoms, You should get that checked out.  <0> What kinds of symptoms should I really be concerned about? Surely if I'm just tired I don't have to assume the worst, right? <1> i wouldnt assume the worst, But currently there is no known cure, But there is promising treatment for it.  <0> What kinds of treatments are there? I think I might need more exercise. <1> Well different doctors have shown that the use of the medication rintatolimod can greatly help with the symptoms.

<0> Are you familiar with Gospel or Christian music? <1> I am. I enjoy both Gospel and Christian music.  <0> I do too.  Gospel music, to my surprise, can be traced to the early 17th century. <1> The early 17th century? I would have guessed even sooner than that.  <0> Yes, me too.  Actually the audience really increased in the 1920's due to the advent of radio.  <1> What about Christian music? Is there a date that is recorded for that becoming more popular? <0> Well, I read that following World War ll gospel music grew and concerts became quite elaborate.  But, contemporary Christian music became popular in the 1980's. <1> I am sure with all that transpired with the war, people were looking for new ways to both inspire faith, and music is always a good way to relate to people.  <0> That's so true. Christian music today really focuses on praise and worship styles similar to pop or rock music.    <1> Exactly! Christian music inspire faith.

<0> Do you enjoy baking items like bread or cookies? <1> yes i actually have a lot of experience in baking especially cakes and brownies <0> Do you have any special techniques to make sure the cakes and brownies heat thoroughly? <1> Instead of putting the oven 350 like the recipe calls for, I lower the temperature to 300-325 and let it bake a little longer instead of blasting it with high heat <0> That's a good tip! I could see that applying for other batters and pizza dough to make sure the crust is crispy and still is soft in the center. <1> As long as you keep your eye on the oven at all times its easier to gradually adjust the baking temperature as needed  <0> Baking is such an important skill for cooking, especially since bread is a common and nutritious food for many cultures. <1> Bread is important in so many cultures and baking is a form of art in some senses.

<0> Childcare is actualy considered a skill and it covers a broad topic of prof., institutions, activities and conventions. <1> I can see that being a skill. You have to know a lot of different topics. <0> Yes, child care providers are our childrens first teacher, if you think about it..besides us as the paremts. <1> I agree.

Then I have to go all over this month after month of them fixing their errors. <1> Sounds like a nightmare! total.  <0> Well, even though they make mistakes with the billing, at least they do not shut off my service.

Macadamia are my personal favorite. I work at a bar and the country music they play puts me at ease. <1> walnut chocolate chip is my favorite ! I have become quite well at cooking. But I too love some country music playing! <0> I'm experimenting more recently with cooking myself! What are some of your favorite country artists? <1> I like Dolly Parton. Country music is music of working class Americans, it is not popular right now.

I am very lucky to have such a great family. <1> Having a solid family makes a good foundation for a happy life! <0> What kind of music do you like?

<0> I like jazz. Do you? <1> I'm actually not a fan of jazz, but many people are and it is hailed as one of America's original art forms. <0> I see do you like rock music or heavy metal? <1> I like rock a lot better even though it was influenced by jazz. It was also influenced by the "British Invasion" in 1964. <0> The British invaded a lot of places didnt they? because they were imperialists.  <1> Haha, yes they did. However the British invasion in the 1960s was due to counterculture in the United States.
<0> Hi I am so mad at my friend. <1> What did they do? <0> I wanted a new dress. But my best friend bought the dress for herself. <1> Have you thought about the same dress in maybe a different color? <0> I dont like to match anyone, I would rather stand out.  <1> Well I guess you have two choices. Find a different dress or a new best friend! <0> True. I guess the dress would be easier  <1> Yeah, I think so too. Best friends are hard to come by these days. <0> Agreed! Do you have a best friend? <1> Maybe one. I'm not really a people person.
<0> So I have a private office at work. Someone broke in the morning and stole $20 off my desk.  <1> Why would you have twenty dollars on the desk
<0> twins are such an interesting subject!what can you tell me about them <1> Well, they are two offspring produced by the same pregancy - kinda like a 2 for 1 sale! <0> yeah! what type of twins are there? <1> Well, you can have identical which means the egg splits, or you can have fraternal where there are two separate eggs.   <0> ohh interesting. what else can you tell me about twins? <1> There are actually people in the world that are non-related look alikes - they are called doppelgangers.

<0> My dad is a huge fan of showtime networks but i dont even remember what type of content they produce. Do you? <1> Showtime programming primarily includes theatrically released motion pictures and original television series. <0> ohh gotcha. When did showtime get its start? <1> The company was established in 1963 as Showtime/The Movie Channel Inc. <0> The movies channel lol. What a fitting name. What are some popular showtime shows? <1> I don't remember but the showtime brand is used by a number of channels around the world but primarily refers to the group of 8 channels in U.S. <0> Oh wow they have 8 channels? They are really something. What else is intersting about showtime? <1> In 1985 Warner sold its half-interest in the company to Viacom, that is now its sole owner/ <0> They are well known I must say! My friend loves watching that company!
<0> sounds interesting . i majored in labor relations . <1> i'm not even sure how that works . can you explain ? <0> The beach can be so hot in the summer. I would rather go to a colder place <1> I don't mind the heat if I'm just sitting on the beach <0> I have an allergy to the sun, so it will always be a no for me, unless its late in the evening <1> Oh that's too bad. Does sunscreen help at all? <0> A little,but I still burn pretty bad. I do love going to the zoo to see the zebras <1> Me too! Tigers are my favorite animal.  <0> I have my car interior as zebra stripe, how odd is that for a older woman? <1> It's not that odd. Everyone has their own preference! Are you a big fan of cars?
<0> i m afraid of clowns <1> Ha! Well I have NO idea why....I mean all that creepy makeup, painted on smile, leering voice.....so did you watch "IT", the most recent version of Stephen King's novel?! <0> no it is too scary for me to watch <1> I have no desire, that's for sure. There was a time I liked films like that. And really, The Shining was a masterpiece with King as author and Kubrick as director! Have you seen it? <0> i read the book before I seen the movie, I enjoyed both <1> So when you read the story, did you find Jack Nicholson a good choice for Jack-the-writer-and alcoholic who becomes caretaker of the Overlook Hotel? <0> not really, because you knew Jack was going to go crazy because he is Jack :)
<0> i do not know just like the strong taste . <1> stronge taste ? ew that is very nasty nasty <0> I think you might like them if you were to try them.  <1> is there a certain way i should prepare them? <0> I prefer to saute them, but a lot of people like them in salads.  <1> Sauteed? Do you eat them alone? <0> I like to stir in onion, garlic and red pepper flakes while they are cooking. <1> Do you have a favorite recipe with them? <0> Yeah, I really love sautéed dandelion greens with eggs in the morning.  <1> Sounds good, i rarely eat breakfast.  <0> Breakfast is very important and it only takes about 10 minutes to make!

Where I succeeded in flashing my underwear to the entire street.  Oh the embarrassment. <1> Oh my goodness! Thats terrible. Did anyone see? My face would be bright red. <0> Oh my face was very red indeed and yes unfortunately I got a hugh cheer from a group of lads who witnessed it all.  I was so mortified I just ran home.

<0> hello, what do you think about people with brown hair? <1> I love brown hair, I was born with brown hair. <0> Me too, Brown hair is most common after black hair <1> Wow, I would have thought blonde hair was most common.  <0> Me too, Its strands are actualle thicker than those of fair hair except those that have red hair <1> I wish that I had never dyed my hair blonde it damaged it terribly. <0> i did too and regretted it. Hair color is pirmentation due to 2 types of melanin <1> I have learnt my lesson
<0> Oh wow!  Are you able to function when you get up? <1> Yes. When I wake, i listen to the song "Night Owl", by James Taylor from 1967. <0> That is cool. I like to drink coffee when I wake up. Do you exercise? <1> I love coffee, actually. I drink a few cups every morning! <0> Me too. I like to use a french press when I have time. I like to measure the water and beans using a scale. <1> That would be helpful. I use a normal coffee maker. <0> Do you also add milk and sugar to your coffee?
<0> My boyfriend came home from his trip two days early!  <1> What a nice surprise! Did something happen or did he miss you!?

Have you ever been to Paris before? <1> I have never been to Paris. A friend just came back and said it was a great experience. <0> So what are you plans for Paris visit? <1> I plan to visit soon.
<0> I am going to find another job this week <1> Well good luck for you. you don't like your old one? <0> 6th graders can be a bit challenging. I have been teaching for 12 years and I am ready for a change.  <1> Wow! Twelve years of teaching ANY age group would be challenging!  <0> I may try something more creative. I go to karaoke every Friday night and that is always the best part of my week.  <1> I didn't know you could sing! That's great! What kind of music do you like?  <0> I enjoy listening to dance type music, but I mostly sing 90's female alternative. What music are you into?
<0> I am learning how sew my own clothes. I am studying hard and I think I will be able to make my first outfit! <1> Ooh,  I've always wanted to learn how to do that. You must be so excited!
<0> So i have a little bakery with my wife 24 cupcakes, we bake from day to night, do you like to bake? <1> I bake bread which is the most common item to bake, but that's it. <0> Oh thats cool, good old bread one of the oldes recipes, from Jesus christ times there was bread, so baking is really old! do you like baked sweets? cupcakes cakes?  <1> I love all of it! I also heard that sometimes people combine baking with grilling to create a hybrid barbecue effect. Strange but fascinating. <0> I didnt know about this, well theres always ways to change the texture of the most common foods, sometimes when we do not have our hoven, we pan frye the bread, and taste simular to when you bake it! <1> That's amazing. I prefer the professional touch of home bakers, since now most baking is automated by machines in factories. <0> Yes you can taste the diference in the baking hoven, pizzerias for example bake in wooden hovens and tastes so unique! <1> I definitely agree! I just found out that baking has traditionally been done by women at home, and by men in bakeries and restaurants. Kinda sexist but it's nice that it's different now.
<0> we were without power for one day , and lost one tree . we lucked out . <1> good to hear , i'm thinking of dying my blonde hair , any suggestions ? <0> Have you ever been blonde before? <1> No. I am 53 and from and live in Alabama <0> What color is your natural hair color?  I wouldn't go too drastic. <1> I am brown. No maybe some highlights. <0> I wouldn't go full blonde.  I think highlights would be nice. 
<0> that is cool he goes with you . i mainly have my dogs to hang out with <1> we have dogs too , only reasons we will never go on a cruise ship <0> I have 2 golden retrievers. What type of dogs do you have? <1> I have a Husky and a maltese Shiz Tzu. They are my little babies! <0> Aww, I bet they are gorgeous! My parents love my pets too and treat them like grandkids. haha. <1> Mine too! They are definitely loved and treated like our kids by the whole family. How long have you had your babies? <0> I have had mine for 3 years? Do you enjoy dressing them up for Halloween? <1> Oh yes! This year they will be dressed up as Count Dracula and Mrs. Dracula.

<0> I took my neice to volunteer at a homeless shelter this past weekend. She showed alot of compassion and love for the homless and needy.  <1> That's really thoughtful of you. Do you typically do things like that? <0> Well I volunteer to help abused and battered kids. I wanted to show her things like this. I know she can be a good loving person.  <1> Perhaps I should find the local shelter in my community and do the same. I have never done that before and I feel like I should be giving back to those less fortunate in some capacity. <0> That's great! I can go with you if you want!
<0> yes , he knew it was my favorite hobby . you married ? <1> no single , i am buying a house and will have a garden there . <0> Really?  I love gardening, what kind of plants do you plan to plant? <1> I want to keep it low maintenance, so that I have time to go to the beach as well, which is nearby <0> Understandable.  I'd recommend just evergreens then.  I wish i lived near the beach. <1> Good idea ! I think I'll need to do some research into conditions and soil before buying. Do you surf ? <0> No, but I love the ocean and spending time with family and friends there. <1> I do paddle bard when I'm off work, and I hope my new house is fully decorated so I don't need to miss too many summer days. <0> I tried paddle boarding once.  It was a disaster, fell right off.  When do you hope to move in?
<0> I was going to a pumpkin patch with my sister in law,  and I let her drive my car. <1> That sounds like fun! What happened? <0> I wasn't feeling good so she drove,  but she drives kind of fast. Usually I don't let anyone drive my car. <1> Yeah- I understand that. I don't let anyone drive my car,  either. I hope everything worked out okay! <0> Yes, it can be a huge mistake. Ultimately it could end a friendship if something goes wrong.
<0> Someone left their trash in the bed of my truck. <1> Oh man, that kind of thing would make me furious. Do you have any idea who it might have been? <0> No idea. I just cleaned it up <1> that's awful! have you tried calling your local police about this? :(  <0> no, I read a lot of sci fi and I try to imagine weird ways that this stuff could have happened. <1> i love sci-fi.although, i hope this person doesn't have powers to put trash in your truck. 
<0> Almost all of the people in my family have brown hair. Although some have a varied shade of brown. <1> I have brown hair, but it was actually pretty blond when I was small. <0> It is interesting that eumelanin and pheomalanin are the two types of melanin that decide the hair color. <1> I wonder how the melanin changes- like hair gets lighter after time in the sun. <0> I believe it is due to the fact that melanin changes over time as a result the color can change slightly over time as well <1> Why does some people's hair change to gray but others change to pure white?
<0> I have.  I actually have played for a couple of seasons.  I normally use ESPN for my fantasy leagues <1> Cool, the players choose rosters during a draft at the beginning of the season where all NFL players are chosen. <0> these days i mostly play for fun though, not for money <1> I always play for money. I like the thrill of it. <0> I wonder if it'll ever get legislated as a type of gambling or betting. <1> I don't know. I assumed it was considered a legal form of gamblng already. What a coincidence that we both play. <0> There are actually surprisingly few regulations on it. I certainly wouldn't want to be involved with writing those laws though. <1> I don't play fantasy leagues
<0> hi i am a fan of brittany spears <1> hi ! i see things . . . a lot . <0> i like to take care of myself with expensive things <1> i'm an alcoholic , but i'm recovering <0> i love to tan all of the time in special shops <1> You must have a lot of money to buy expensive things

Did you watch the new Lion King? <1> No not yet, I'm waiting to get everyone together for that.  <0> I enjoyed it. Will you be getting Disney Plus? <1> Yes. I live with my parents in their old age, and my kids at home. It will be good for the whole family <0> There will be many things for you all to watch together. <1> Exactly! I figure that is more family friendly than a lot of alternatives I would watch on my own haha

I am always on edge in those cases. I hydroplaned really bad last time. <1> I'm glad you were okay and nothing bad happened.  <0> It was kind of exciting. It was like being on a scary roller coaster.
<0> hello ! how has your day been ? <1> my day was good , sort of chilly . <0> i worked this morning in a soup kitchen as a volunteer <1> cool . i would love to do that . not many soup kitchens here in canada . <0> in my free time i watch war documentaries <1> that's great , my grandfather served in world war ii <0> my family didn't make a lot of money growing up <1> mine either . i had to drop out of high school to help support the family . <0> I worked at mcdonalds when I was growing up.
<0> Hey, I love the Jazz music that originated from African-American communities of New Orleans. Do you like it? <1> I do and i am also from new orleans so that is cool! What are popular instruments in jazz music? <0> It can be played in guitar, and drums. It's characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals. Its very fun.  <1> I see.

There's really too many to count! <1> Ohh okay.

Did jazz influence another category of music?

Do you drink often? <0> Yes I take a beer that contains 6% and it knocks me off every time i take it
<0> I just dyed my hair burgandy, kind of regretting it <1> Oh wow!  Did you have it done  professionally by a hairdresser or did you do it yourself at home? <0> I did it at home and obviously did not think it through, Burgandy is not a natural hair color so it looks weird <1> Interestingly, in 2016 sales for home coloring kits were close to $2.2 billion!  So you're probably not the only one to choose a, shall we say, unfortunate color! <0> Well at least I picked a good brand, Loreal, the cheap brands will burn and damage hair <1> Thank goodness for small favors!  LOL Why did you want to color it?  For cosmetic reasons, to cover gray? <0> To cover gray for sure! <1> I cover my gray hairs too, I am self-conscious about it.

<0> & is my favorite number <1> The number 7 was written by Hindus in a single stroke as a curve that looks like an upper case J vertically inverted. <0> Really? I know nothing about the history its just been a lucky number for me gambling lol <1> I oddly spent some time learning about the number, because I like it too. Eastern Arabs developed 7 from a 6 lookalike into an uppercase v lookalike. <0> Wow that is interesting, what else do you know about my lucky number 7? <1> Both modern Arab forms influenced the European form, a two-stroke character. <0> Oh ok do other cultures think its a lucky number too? <1> I don't know anything about numbers.
<0> I get so annoyed when it rains I had plans for a family cookout but it started thundering and lightening such a bummer.  <1> Oh no that is a total bummer. It's especially common in the summer months. <0> Yes it's the worse especially in Florida it's sunny one day and pouring down raining the next.  <1> Oh right,  I spent some time in Florida when I was younger and I remember it being so unpredictable. Just gotta keep an umbrella all the time lol. <0> Yes, but it's not raining, so I won't need an umbrella. It's sunny here.
<0> My car window was broken when i walked up to my car this morning! <1> That is so messed up! <0> Yeah it is! Im going to have to spend money I didnt have. Im so upset right now. <1> I hope this doesn't happen again. <0> Me neither, the last thing I wanted to do was get my window fixed.
<0> i have 2 pitt bulls ! luna and micco <1> their names are oingo and boingo <0> how old are they? <1> Oingo is 2 years old and boingo is just a puppy, 4 months old.   <0> My dogs are a lot older 6 and 7 years old. My parents hate them though. <1> Oh ! That is not good. Why your parents don't like your dogs ? <0> They are used to having a yard and my parents house doesn't have one. <1>  I understand, it is difficult for them to stay for a long time in the house. I take my dogs out every night. <0> I do as well but I'm in Nw York City so there aren't really any parks for them nearby. <1> That makes it more difficult. I take my dogs with me to visit some orphanages. the kids have a good time. <0> That's really cool. <1> I help the orphanages with money donations also but taking the dogs makes a big difference. <0> I don't donate to orphanages but I do donate to the local food bank here. <1> I was usually donate money to good things
<0> i hate mondays what about you <1> mondays used to suck , but i'm retired so they don't bother me <0> i just got my first house <1> i remember that feeling , its a good one , do you love it ? <0> yes indeed . i just moved to the us too <1> oh where were you from before <0> i'm from the uk <1> oh i want to visit there very badly , but my cancer just went into remission <0> what kind of cancer do you have
<0> I love Jazz music it is so soothing and the sound just makes you want to dance all night.  <1> I know it is considered to be "America's classical music."  But I don't know a lot about it.  <0> It is originated back in the late 1900's I know a little about the sound because my granddad played the genre alot.  <1> Cool. I know it is considered "one of America's original art forms." Do you have a favorite Jazz musician? <0> Of course you should listen to Nina Simone she is a great women Jazz singer her voice is amazing.  <1> I will! Does your whole family like jazz music?
<0> My favorite color is red, it's flashy, catches people's attention, and is used everywhere for all kinds of purposes! <1> Mine too! Its said that red makes a person appear more attractive, like an illusion of sorts! <0> Oh yeah, I'm not surprised. Red and other colors are super influential. Cops are more likely to pull over a car if it's red. <1> Oh no! I need a new car now. Lol <0> Same actually. I have a dark red Chevy Cruze and I worry sometimes because of it. I've been lucky so far, knock on wood! <1> Yeah!!! I wonder when the color red first appeared in pigments according to humans? <0> Well, prehistoric art used ochre, a reddish brown colored type of rock, so quite a long time ago. <1> Oh yes and some minerals appear red when oxidized too.

I am slightly obsessed with him lol <1> Oh, yeah. I know who you are talking about now. <0> Seriously attractive! Whew! I met him at a concert last month while I was there shooting some photos for the local paper.  <1> You did not! How was it? <0> It was absolutely amazing!!

<0> I have brown hair. what about you ? <1> I have light brown hair. It's apparently the most common hair color, after black <0> Yeah. which shampoo do you use ? <1> I use Tresemme. How about you? Do you dye your hair with hair coloring? <0> I use pantene. No, i don't dye my hair. <1> Me neither. What kind of hairstyle or haircut do you normally wear?

<0> Red is next to orange and opposite of violet in the spectrum of light!  <1> Oh really? I never knew that! Red is one of my favorite colors! What colors do you like? <0> I really like pink- which a very pale red!  <1> Pink is very nice too! There are so many beautiful shades of red!  <0> There really are- I actually had no idea. They range from scarlet and vermillion to crimson to pale red pink to dark red burgandy.  <1> I love dark red burgandy! It's a very rich color. Do you agree? <0> I do love a deep, rich burgandy. I also love red ochre- like the color of iron oxide.  <1> Yes, I think I know what color you mean. I think red is a happy color. I even had a red car!  <0> I think it's been a popular color throughout history. In the Renaissance, nobles actually used cochineals to dye their costumes a brilliant red. 
<0> My dream car is a Hyundai Genesis,  but I didn't get approved for financing unfortunately. <1> Sorry to hear that you did not get approved. <0> It's ok,  a car is another bill for me anyway. I'll keep taking Lyft. <1> You are right about that. Owning a car can get expensive. <0> What's your dream car? <1> I would love to have a Lamborghini.
<0> I have naturally brown hair, it's the second most common hair color after black <1> Brown hair is lovely! I didn't realize it was that popular! Are there a lot of shades of brown hair? <0> There are, it varies from light brown to almost black. Mine is closer to almost black so it makes it hard for me to change my color up without bleaching it. <1> Mine is a more like a dark blonde. I've always wanted to dye my hair brown though! <0> Go ahead and dye it! 75% of women and 15% of men report having dyed hair. <1> 75% of women?! Wow! I would have never guessed it would be that high! Is there a specific term that refers to people with brown hair? <0> They're often referred to as "brunette" which in french is the feminine from of "brunet", the diminutive of "brun" (brown) <1> That's right, thank you! I couldn't think of the word! Are there many famous brunettes?  <0> Oh lots! It's a common haircolor of people from Europe and the US and also some populations in the Greater Middle East.
<0> yes , he knew it was my favorite hobby . you married ? <1> no single , i am buying a house and will have a garden there . <0> Really?  I love gardening, what kind of plants do you plan to plant? <1> I want to keep it low maintenance, so that I have time to go to the beach as well, which is nearby <0> Understandable.  I'd recommend just evergreens then.  I wish i lived near the beach. <1> Good idea ! I think I'll need to do some research into conditions and soil before buying. Do you surf ? <0> No, but I love the ocean and spending time with family and friends there. <1> I do paddle bard when I'm off work, and I hope my new house is fully decorated so I don't need to miss too many summer days. <0> I tried paddle boarding once.  It was a disaster, fell right off.  When do you hope to move in? <1> In 6 weeks - fingers crossed. Yes, it takes time to learn, but great fun once you have. Do you go to family beaches ?

It's a beautiful place! <0> Wow i have heard about the place but not been there .. <1> It's pretty small, but the beautiful scenery is great for relaxing and gathering inspiration. <0> describe the landscape . <1> It's pretty flat for the most part, though there is a large amount of coastline on the border of the country. <0> Wow Great! What is your favorite song?
<0> ive never really used hair colors <1> It is the practice of changing the color of one's hair <0> oh yea makes sense <1> It can be done professionally by a hair dresser or at home <0> at home can be quite a mess <1> Yes, independent home hair styling can be tough, and takes much skill
<0> My boyfriend unexpectedly came home from his trip two days early! <1> did he catch you doing something crazy?
<0> hi ! doing well , how about you ? <1> great how are you doing ? <0> I am doing ok. I have had some crazy experiences recently. <1> Honestly I have too, what sort of crazy experiences? <0> I had a near death experience after crashing my sports car. <1> Wow, that's rough, are you okay now at least? <0> Yeah, fine. I have a habit of driving too fast. Are you a fan of sports cars? <1> I'm not. They are too scary for me!
<0> My father was a soldier, did you ever join the army? <1> Yes, I voluntarily enlisted. <0> Thank You for your services, what is it like being enlisted. <1> It was great, I was what you would call an infantryman in the ranks. <0> What kind of work did you do as a infantry? <1> I used to engage in military combat on foot. <0> Did you ever get deployed?
<0> i'm so excited i will be graduating high school in a couple years <1> that's great ! are you going to college ? <0> yes ! i want to be a vegan chef . being vegan is fun ! ! <1> that is kind of similar to the way i eat , i can only eat kosher <0> i do not know what that's . i like kosher pickles . <1> kosher means that it has been blessed by a rabbi <0> oh that sounds rad . <1> it is very rad . <0> how long have you been eating kosher ? <1> i have done it my whole life . i was raised jewish by my single mother <0> cool beans . i've a rad bedroom with purple and lime green walls . <1> Why did you paint it those colors?
<0> By today's standards I am not physically fit.  I like the definition of the industrial revolution: ability to carry out the day's activities without undue fatigue.   <1> That is crazy I guess I am not fit either but I just got a gym membership <0> Today the definition includes proper nutrition and sufficient rest as well.  I eat right, but I don't sleep!  <1> Oh I am the same way! I eat really healthy but I have sleeping problems! What other standards are there? <0> Well, your gym membership is good, because there is a relation between fitness and attractiveness that caused gyms to spring up in the last 30 years. <1> Oh I guess I haven't thought of how recently popular they have become. Have you tried crossfit? <0> I haven't, because I thought it was Olympic weightlifting?  I'm more of a Zumba gal. <1> Oh okay I see! My best friend teaches zumba I went to her classes to support, it is so hard
<0> I love rap music. I just started listening to Snoop Dogg. <1> Not really a fan of Snoop Dogg,  but I know little about him <0> What's his real name? <1> His real name is Calvin Cordozar Broadus, Jr. (born October 20, 1971 <0> lol What kind of name is that for a gangster? How did he come up in the rap game? <1> Lol,  His music career began in 1992 when he was discovered by Dr. Dre, and as a result he was featured on Dre's solo debut, "Deep Cover
<0> i had helped him to secure a good job, and he became rich, One day he saw me discussing with his fiancee, he didnt ask question first, he just came there and slapped me, we now engaged in a serious fight <1> That is such a bizarre story. <0> It truly is bizarre. <1> Did you end up getting hurt in the fight and suing him? <0> I did end up getting hurt and dumping him. <1> You are better off without him.  You should definitely marry someone in the military.  We are honorable people.  <0> I found my husband after that garbage happened. <1> That's great news!  Where did you meet your husband?  I met mine while stationed in Hawaii.  We are both serving in the military.  <0> I met him in a business meeting. I run my own consulting firm.

<0> I ate too many sweets the other day,  they were so good though. <1> really what kind of sweets did you eat? <0> I don't remember the name,  but they looked like regular cookies.  <1> I love cookies especially oreo's they are my favorite <0> I'm not a big fan of Oreos. I prefer macadamia nut cookies.
<0> I have brown hair. <1> Me too! Pretty much everybody in my family does, since we're all descendants of central Europeans. <0> Most of my family has brown hair also. <1> Have you ever tried to dye it? I attempted to dye my hair blue before, but it didn't take since my hair is so dark. I would probably have to bleach it to make it work. <0> I have dyed my hair a few times with success. In order to do colorful or bright, it would need to be bleached first. <1> Yeah, that's probably the best idea. I'm a bit intimidated by trying to bleach it at home, though. I'd probably just go to a hairdresser at a salon to do it for me. <0> Using a hairdresser is probably the best option. I would be afraid to do it on my own. <1> Me too!!! At least a hairdresser has some degree of training. If I can't manage to do it myself, might as well go to somebody licensed for it <0> My thoughts exactly! <1> What colors did you dye your hair before?
<0> I have heard of freshwater pearls, so I'm not so surprised.  How many kinds are there? <1> I am not sure as to the number but I do know that some crustaceans that are enjoyed by diners are lobster, shrimp, and crabs. <0> It's been so long since I've had a good seafood boil. At the bar, we just have the cocktail shrimp. <1> Some people are allergic to seafood <0> I know, it's so unfortunate! I couldn't imagine life without crab legs and mussels. <1> Yes, I think they can be very tasty too.

<0> I love the color red, because red roses are my favorite. <1> Ah yes. Red, the color of Iron and of Mars. But more importantly, the color of Scuderia Ferrari! Corsa Rossa! <0> Scueria Ferrari!  Yes! What a beauty!  Red in their logo really sets them apart. <1> I'm a big fan of the Iceman. Kimi Raikkonen, the Finn in the Ferrari. <0> I'm not too familiar with racing, but I do enjoy watching it on TV every now and then.  My husband thinks I'm silly because I always root for the red cars! <1> Well you can't go wrong rooting for the oldest sruviving and the most successful Fomula One team. Ferrari has competed in every season since 1950. <0> Thank you for the info!  You have intrigued me, and I am definitely going to research this more in depth!  You may have created a new fan of the Red Ferrari Formula One team! <1> I hate Iceman.
<0> so friend i just went on a vacation and i was very happy i needed it <1> Yes! where did you go? do you feel relaxed? <0> We went to Rome. It was pretty cool. We stayed in a convent just a block from the Spanish Steps. <1> Last time I went on vacation I got a little too crazy and ended up coming back with two tattoos! <0> Hey, permanent souvenirs! Nice! What did you get? <1> I got red flames across both arms. The color contrasts well with my curly red hair. <0> You're lucky. I love red hair. I'm blonde and used to dye my hair red, but it never looked natural. My skin coloring or something was off. <1> Actually I think contrast wasn't the right word. It's better to say that it complements my red hair! <0> I think contrasting and complementary colors might be the same? Like purple/yellow and red/green are complementary colors, but they are pretty contrast-y. <1> That might be true. Unfortunately I don't think I know much about the subject. <0> Oh, I don't either. Doesn't stop me from speculating, though! What's your jam? What do you know a lot about? <1> Music. I could tell you everything there is to know about any genre. <0> What kinds do you like to listen to most? <1> Classical but sometimes I seem not to know anything about some genre of music.
<0> I'm very excited about this weekend. Two days with literally no plans and no responsibilities! <1> Dang! What are going to do with all that free time!?
<0> One time when I was letting my cat outside,  it ran out into the streets and got ran over <1> Oh my god! That's terrible! <0> Then I woke up,  it was all a dream. <1> Oh that's so great! <0> Not really! That is terrible!
<0> yes a few of them do i play on their computer . my mom teaches math <1> awesome . she must help you a lot with school . <0> No. She is harder on me than the rest of the kids because she doesn't want them to think I'm the pet <1> Oh, I see. Your mom is an angel! <0> IDK about that part. She is a nice lady, but I don't like her as a teacher she is mean. <1> i have a teacher that comes to my house to teach me as i am bedridden <0> Oh wow. Are you sick? <1> No i am not
<0> My mom went on a diet and lost 40lbs. <1> Oh wow, that is great for her <0> I know and I am so happy that she is doing that. Do you regularly exercise? <1> I try to, I am actually dieting right now <0> I hope its going well for you. I actually hate running but I have to force myself if I want to stay healthy. <1> thanks, it's going pretty good. Yes, I walk on a treadmill, but I always feel good after <0> I'm married with kids so find it hard to go to the gym but I know what you mean about feel good afterwards. Are you married? <1> No, it's good that you can find the time with everything you have going on though <0> Its a juggle but I you're right, I have too. What type of exercise do you do? <1> For sure! Mostly the treadmill and minor weight lifting. Just running for you? <0> Yes running as Its the only work out that I can do where I can have some quiet time to myself before I start my day. <1> That's great to take that time for yourself, I don't run much, but it's very freeing <0> Really? I don't exercise at all but I've heard it can be good.
<0> Went to get an oil change the other day. Turns out I didn't need one for another 1, 000 miles,  and I felt like such a fool. <1> Well better to be sooner than later on something like that. Dont be hard on yourself.  <0> Agreed,  and it had been 5 months so I figured I was due. The mechanic was really condescending which was what made it embarrassing! <1> Thats so silly its none of his worry. He needs to hush up. lol  <0> I know, it's not like I intentionally did anything wrong.
<0> I can feel a cold sore coming on on my lip! Quite a frustrating thing before a big job interview I have! <1> I hate when those come around <0> Me too, my father used to be an insurance salesmen <1> Did he enjoy it? is that what you do for a living? <0> No, random tangent. But, yes he did enjoy it.  <1> I'm hoping to start my own business soon, I want to be my own boss <0> That's a strong move. What kind of business would you start. DO NOT START A SALAD COMPANY. I hate salads. <1> I agree! I was thinking of starting a private nursing company <0> Private nursing huh? Contract with hospitals and clinics? <1> Yes, I think the government is slowly destroying the NHS, can't believe we are to have a general election!    <0> I can see that. And yes, we need some new faces in office. The ones we have are...questionable. <1> Completely agree, I don't think i will vote this time. No one worth voting for

<0> I am ready for winter, I bought a coat. <1> I'm not too fond of winter, but what kind of coat did you buy? <0> One of those professional looking ones, you know that office workers go for. <1> Like a long wool coat? Something like that? <0> Yeah that kind of thing. With the lapel and everything. <1> Nice! They look sharp, but they're also really cozy. They feel like you're wearing a bathrobe everywhere lol <0> Yeah, it's so soft. Once you get over the cold, winter is a great season.  <1> Absolutely, I love winter. Is that your favourite season?
<0> The worst day of my life was when I was 8 months pregnant with our first child and I started bleeding like crazy. <1> Oh no! that sounds so scary. was everything ok?
<0> I may have heard a few. I cant be to sure though. <1> Many of the songs trace back to Africa, and even Great Britain. <0> Oh? I'd love to hear those. Especially while I'm sitting back fishing from my boat. I love to go fishing <1> Fishing is truly fun. We occasionally go with my friends too. Do you go frequently? <0> Well, I currently work at a deli counter so I have plenty of free time. I try to go as much as possible. <1> I'd like to go fishing more but none of my friends are interested. My job gives me the opportunity to go a lot also. DO you go alone? <0> I sometimes take my significant other with me. It's something I enjoy being alone with myself doing.  <1> I would like to go someday but not alone my husband works alot so when I'm alone I have my music while fishing. Who's favorite music artist ? <0> I understand. My favorite would have to be Marvin Gaye or Tracy Chapman <1> I love them both omg!!! It is hard to pick one out of those to lol. I love Michael Jackson . <0> Michael Jackson is the name of my best friend!  <1> Are you serious that so cool. I wonder did y'all tease him growing up lol.
<0> am fine and how about you <1> not to bad . just got done playing with my parrot . <0> Whoa!  You have a parrot!  That's kinda cool.  I wish I could have a pet. <1> I had always wanted one, and I finally made the choice to get one. <0> I always wanted a dog, but my wife won't allow it. <1> If i had a dog, he would probably eat my parrot! <0> HaHa!  That's true.  Does your parrot talk?  If so, what does he say? <1> He mostly repeats what he hears around me.
<0> his music began in 1992 when i started to listen to him, have you heard his music ? <1> No, I haven't what is his best song? <0> i like his debut album style, have you got a favourite artist ? <1> Yes, Tina Turner is my favorite singer <0> nice have you heard all her music ? <1> Many of her albums, I am sure there are some things I've missed. <0> she is very good, i like movies from marvel as well for the music in it. do you like to watch movies ? <1> Yes. Kung Fu movies are my favorite.
<0> Hair coloring or dyeing is changing the hair color from it's original color. My favorite color was smurf blue! <1> My daughter dyed her hair blue at one point! What else can you tell me about hair dyeing? <0> The main reasons people color their hair is to cover gray or white hair but now people just like to be creative <1> I've seen so many different colors lately. Pink seems to be popular. <0> Yes, definitely! It's crazy to think in a study done by University of Copenhagen it found 75% of woman and 18% of men colored their hair <1> Yeah I really would like to try dyeing mine sometime soon I think it would update my look nicely, I think I would go with pink.

Where did they all go? <0> Well I used to hang out with a lot of my coworkers but I left that job. And just kind of drifted away from everyone else. I definitely need to find a new sport or something and make new friends. <1> Yeah,  that is tough.  Once you get to a certain age you have to work pretty hard to meet people.  Maybe you could join a softball league,  that's what I did. <0> I would join softball league, how was your experience there? did you make some friends there?
<0> My favorite football team lost their preseason game and I talked so much smack to everyone saying they was going to win.  <1> that's why i don't watch sports lol we always make fun of our uncle because he talks a lot of smack and die hard Redskins fan <0> I love the Jaguars I was ashamed I talk a lot of smack to everyone lol I guess me and your uncle need to stay quite next time lol.

Do you bake at all? <0> I don't really but since grains have been a staple food of humanity for millennia it is a very old activity, I should really learn. <1> yes, you should. it is very easy and fullfilling. alot of people are intimidated by it, but its easy <0> Yeah I'm not really intimidated, I've just never gotten around to it. Some large households in Rome normally had their own bakers. What is your favorite thing to bake? <1> It would be a toss up between cheesecakes and my Garlic and herb biscuits. <0> Cheesecake is a sweet dessert consisting of one or more layers, how many layers does your cheesecake have? <1> I usually put two layers in my cheesecakes! Each layer consisting of a different flavour.
<0> Our family dog was stolen a week ago and our home haven't been the same. <1> Wow what kind of dog did you lose? <0> A teacup yorkie I miss her so much I have been so heart broken since they stole her while we was out shopping. Had to be someone who was watching us and waited until we left.

I'm tired of cleaning him up. lol <0>  I've read a lot on training dogs, I love to read. It takes time to train them. <1> I don't think there is such a things as a trained dog. It is a lifetime thing. But at least I enjoy it. <0> We'll I've mostly just read about it and haven't really tried it.
<0> The other day this creepy guy followed me around the store and chased me out to the parking lot. He just wouldn't take a hint. <1> That's very creepy,  did he say anything to you? <0> Yeah that's what made it weird,  it was kind of like he was trying to hit on me but just awkward. But he was really pushy about it.

<0> I bake cakes when I am sad or stressed out. <1> The most common baked item is bread. Do you bake other things besides cakes? <0> I like to bake cupcakes sometimes. <1> Baking is traditionally performed by women in the home, but men in bakeries and restaurants. You could have a successful career in baking. <0> Im not that good but I do try to do the fancy cakes you see on Pinterest. <1> The art of baking is a fundamental skill.  <0> Yes its' an exact science too. .You can't measure things by eye. <1> Baking can be considered an art.
<0> I have a twin in real life and when people see us together, I get real sick of them asking if we are twins! <1> How interesting! A developing fetus is called a singleton if they are alone but a multiple if there is more than one developing! <0> Those embryos sure like multiplying! I wonder if twins are more rarer than triplets? <1> Well, the twin birth rate in the US rose from 18.9 to 33.3 for every 1,000 births between 1980 and 2009 <0> Wow, do you know what caused the spike in the rate? Is it a genetic thing? <1> I'm not sure but the Yoruba people have the highest twin rate in the world possibly because they eat a yam that contains a natural phytoestrogen
<0> A lot of people see clowns as physically comedic, but I've always found them physically intimidating. <1> Same here i actually find them to be very scary in my opinion  <0> I think since a lot of cultures have their own styles and variations in costumes when it comes to clowns, some may be creepier than others.
<0> While my car was parked on the street in front of my house last week,  someone ran into it and left a huge dent. <1> Dang,  that sucks. Did you ever catch the culprit?
<0> So I currently have 4 gray hairs. When I get 10 I'm dying my hair as black as night. Have you colored your hair? <1> I used to do it at home (not professionally) but I'm going to stop and let the grey hair take over. Grey hair is pretty trendy now.  <0> I'm gonna pass on the Gray's. I blame them on my wife.  <1> And I'm sure she blames hers on you! Funny how gray hair is associated with age AND stress. Which is it? <0> She is a genetic freak and has 0. <1> She's a "natural" freak - one with a genetic abnormality. Better that than a "made" freak who alters themselves at some point.  <0> As for stress that makes sense I had none until I took over as manager as the highest rated hotel in America. I'm stressed daily. <1> Trump Hotel? You poor man. bwahahahah! 
<0> I went to see the new conjuring movie in the theater.. it was such a terrifying experience <1> Oh wow. is it really as scary as the reviews say it is? <0> that and much more! Especially if you choose to go and watch it alone at night <1> Damn,  sounds like such a stunning experience <0> It was. I was glad that I went because I had the scare of my life and all the adrenaline pumped me up. 
<0> I just celebrated my birthday and it was so much better than usual. <1> That's great. What made it so special this year?
<0> I love the color red, its so unique! (Unlike the other colors) <1> What about red makes you love it over others?  <0> It's just so strong, its so impulsive! It's all, "HEY! I'M RED, YOU SEE THIS?" <1> Ah I see, that's very true. Why do you feel red is such a strong color overall?  <0> It's probably because blood is red, so when people see it, they're like "STUFFS GOING DOWN" and just the color in general.  <1> I agree with you on that. It also is the color of warning signs such as stop signs.  <0> I never even thought of that, very true. It's also the most dominant wavelength. <1> Ah! it's been a while since looking over the color spectrum but that's great to know. 
<0> When I was 12 we went to DisneyWorld <1> A true American right of passage. How does the memory make you feel? <0> i loved it it makes me feel the same way rap music makes me feel just in love <1> i love rap music and strong men or women ! i just want to feel love again <0> well my dad works for stifle maybe i could hook you two up?? <1> possibly but good men are super hard to find ! <0> hes a pretty good guy! hard working so the strong parked is checked off the list <1> Sometimes i love listening to Eminem and Kanye west too <0> yea eminem is one of my favorite artists stan is such a good song <1> Definitely.

<0> JAzz is such pretty music, isn't it? <1> Yes, it is and intellectuals around the world say it is "one of America's original art forms". <0> Oh, that's a beautiful sentiment, where did it originate? <1> It originated in the African-Amercian communities of New Orleans during the late 19th and early 20th centuries <0> Interesting, what a cool origin, is it still going strong today <1> I believe so, since the 1920 it has been as a major form of musical expression. <0> Oh indeed, but what characterizes jazz as jazz? <1> It is characterized by call and response vocals, swing and blue notes, and the polyrhythms and improvisation <0> I see, and who would you say is the most memorable jazz singers out there? <1> Louis Armstrong is my favorite. I love his songs.

So what do you normally do at the beach? Swim or just sunbathe? <0> swim and snorkle..and listen to music..i love justen bieber; i'd like to follow him around on tour <1> I can't imagine following someone around on tour.
<0> sounds interesting . i majored in labor relations . <1> i'm not even sure how that works . can you explain ? <0> The beach can be so hot in the summer. I would rather go to a colder place <1> I don't mind the heat if I'm just sitting on the beach <0> I have an allergy to the sun, so it will always be a no for me, unless its late in the evening <1> Oh that's too bad. Does sunscreen help at all? <0> A little,but I still burn pretty bad. I do love going to the zoo to see the zebras <1> Me too! Tigers are my favorite animal.  <0> I have my car interior as zebra stripe, how odd is that for a older woman? <1> My glasses are held together with tiger stripe duct tape. So, not odd at all! <0> I would pay to see that, I bet you get a lot of compliments? <1> I think people who know me would say that it's fitting of my personality
<0> Ugh,  my neighbor's dog just keeps barking all day long. It's driving me insane. <1> That is frustrating!  We have a couple down the street that raises hunting dogs.  So annoying all day!

Do you know the benefits of walking daily? <0> I hear ya, I have slowed down some myself.  I am guessing the benefits of walking daily might be to  lower blood pressure, relieve stress, maintain weight?  Am I anywhere close to being accurate? <1> I hope so, I need at least two of those - LOL!!  Do you know anything about weight lifting for older women? <0> Not a clue lol! but I know it's very benficial

<0> Ferrari is the coolest car company <1> I agree. The company has been around since 1939. <0> I had no idea that it had been around that long <1> Yup, it has been around for a while. Interesting though is that it was 1947 before the first "Ferrari" was built. <0> Wow, that's amazing. I've always loved Farrari's.
<0> I found a new stray dog eating out the dumpster last Thursday. Today I officially adopted her. <1> how sweet and thoughtful of you <0> I already love her.

I spent last weekend shopping. <0> This weekend is probably going to be terrible because my daughter just died.
<0> Really?I don't, I wouldn't know how to use it anyway.  Of course in the movies hostage situations can be entertaining, I guess. <1> i go to the range with my husband so he taught me how to use it. have you ever heard about bride kidnapping? it's also known as marriage by abduction <0> I've heard of it.. I actually was held hostage once during a store robbery. <1> Oh wow, I am glad you are okay. Nothing you can do to avoid it in public but I have a dog for home protection. <0> I don't have a dog right now.. but we had one growing up.. my dad wasn't home much as he was a cop at the time. <1> I am always home baking and cooking. I would worry about a family member having such a dangerous job. <0> I was always proud of my dad.
<0> Wine tasting is when you examine and evaluate different types of wine with your delicate senses. Ever been? <1> Yes my personal favorite wines to try are white wines. <0> There are in modern times actually professional wine tasters and they use a consantantly ever evolving specialized type of terminology use to desribe the wine an its characaristics like flavors aromas and charactistics. <1> Do you have a personal favorite aroma of your own? <0> I do not because ive only recently turned old enough to drink LOL. So while ive had some im not much of a drinker unless someone else around me is. But interesting fact the aromas of wine are actually morediverse than the flavors available! <1> It really is crazy how many small subtle flavors they can squeeze into the liquid. <0> Yeah agreed. I love scents. But interestingly white wine can be more than just white clearish, it can be straw yellow, yellow-green, or yellow-gold.
<0> One time my family went out to vacation and I was home alone with no friends <1> Oh no,  they went on vacation without you?? 
<0> I bet their burgers tasted way better back then. <1> I find it interesting they didn't always have the golden arches. The first was in 1953 in Phoenix, Arizona. <0> I din't know that <1> I was surprised that Ray Croc wasn't the person who started McDonald's originally.  He's just the one that bought it and started franchising and eventually made it famous. <0> Interesting. My favorite item is the chicken strips <1> Yes, they are good.  But I personally love when the McRib is back. <0> McRib is good too. Do you remember the big and tasty? <1> Yes, I almost forgot about it.  That was a good one.  Even better than the Big Mac in my opinion. <0> Have you ever dipped your fries in Big Mac sauce <1> I have never tried dipping fries in Big Mac Sauce.
<0> Sometimes we can get a phone call that shakes us to the core. <1> That is so true. And sometimes that phone call can be a trip of a life time!
<0> I like to color my hair to cover gray, do you color your hair? <1> Don't tell anyone, but yes, I do!  LOL  I usually get it done professionally by a hairdresser <0> Oh that is good I have made a few mistakes doing my own lol <1> Me too!  I always made such a mess!  Interestingly, there were  $1.9 billion in sales of at home coloring in the U.S. 2011! <0> I believe it hair coloring is expensive, especially the Loreal brand <1> It sure is!  I'd rather get it done at the hair dresser whenever I want to change to a color regarded as more fashionable  <0> I live in a rural area and there are not that many experienced colorists so I do my own <1> Maybe you could check online, there may be someone.
<0> Seven is my favorite number! <1> Mine too! Its been known that since 1977, the muppeteer eric jacobson has been centered as berts performance on sesame street <0> I did not know that! Do you know why other people think it's a lucky numbe? <1> Not sure! But I know of a charcter named lucky on the show general hospital. the characters name is lucky spencer. cool name, huh? <0> That would be a neat name, does Lucky like the number 7? <1> I dont see anything about his favorite number, but i know he wa born in 1985. nothing to do with the number 7 though :/ he was cast in 93 for the show. <0> Do you know if there are any shows based on the number 7? <1> No, I dont know of any shows, but I think theres a movie called Se7en. It has Jjim Carey in it if im not mistaken. I really like medicine shows though. Theyre touring acts  that help heal people between different kinds of entertainment. Its actually reall cool
<0> Hi there, I haven't drunk alcohol for 5 years and going strong <1> Wow congratulations on your sobriety!  That is an awesome accomplishment.  My dad got sober when I was a child. <0> Thank you! It was extremely difficult at the beginning, but during treatment your goal is independence from consuming alcohol  <1> Did you use a specific treatment program to help you achieve your goal? <0> The most important thing for me was the support of my friends and family - they would not drink either when I was around, which suppressed the temptation! The AA meetings were very useful too  <1> That is very helpful.  Have you been through all 12 steps?
<0> Yes, I've had it with ketchup on the side to dip in. <1> Are we talking regular ketchup or mushroom ketchup? I know mushroom ketchup is more of a UK thing, but I've heard good things. <0> Good old Heinz, so regular. What's mushroom ketchup? <1> It's fermented napa cabbage, a Korean dish. <0> Hmm, what's it taste like?

<0> Once I swam with a Manta ray.  <1> That's incredible, was it a reef manta ray? They're the biggest species out of all of them <0> I really don't know they were pretty large, do you know anything else? <1> They were first given the name in 1868 by an Australian Museum director, they are relatively docile too. <0> Did  you know that The greatest threat to manta rays is over fishing?

I remember doing some wine tasting when I visited Napa, but I would like to learn more about different wines <1> One of my favorite types of wine is cabernet sauvignon.  Which is one of the most popular and recognized red varietals. <0> What about Merlot?, could you tell me what is different about it? <1> Merlot is deemed to be "softer" and "fleshy" than cabernet which is usually smokier and deeper. <0> What about the whites what is the difference between a Pinot Griggio and a Sauvignon? <1> I'm not too versed on whites.  I do know that another popular variety of red is pinot noir, and the grapes are grown in cooler locations.
<0> i'm so sorry to hear that did you call her ? <1> she's dead we were watching thomas the train and then she was gone <0> Jesus. That's horrible. How are you coping? <1> I'm still kind of numb. It feels unreal. <0> Yeah. It will for a while. Plus everybody copes differently.  There's no "right" way to do it, no matter what people say. <1> Well at least she's in a better place. I'm just going to miss her. <0> Do you have anyone close to you to lean on for support? <1> I really don't feel like reaching out. I just want to curl up with some ice cream and be alone for a while. <0> You know what, that's totally ok. You have to look after yourself. <1> I think I might actually need someone to talk about it.

That's almost one for every day of the year! Haha! <0> Oh wow, I figured there were only a few. That is crazy, maybe I was too boxed in! <1> Oh yeah! There's a ton of varieties! And if you get tired of the typical flour pasta, you can try pasta made from rice flour!  <0> I have never tried that, I wonder how different the taste really is! <1> I've had rice noodles in Chinese food and they were really good! Very light and gluten free! <0> I should give that a try sometime soon then I like chinese food! <1> Yeah, it's a shame there isn't more variety in Chinese cuisine.

It's amazing how much you can grow in a small space. <0> I live in a suburban area but have a nice back yard. <1> Wow! I want to come visit your garden! Ha! Do you grow the plants directly in your yard or do grow the plants in large containers? <0> A mix of both. I usually do half and half. Although certain veggies grow better in pots <1> Well, i live in the midwest and it gets really cold out here. Do you recommend any plants that can grow in harsh weather? <0> I suppose a number of succulents would be able to thrive in the midwest
<0> Lol! Was that a reality or a food for thought? <1> Not sure? Our relationship came about as an extension of our friendship. How about you? <0> Kind of the same.

Have you been to any concerts recently? <1> Not lately, No very many band make it out into my area. <0> I suppose I should stop wasting so much money on concerts. Don't want to end up as a janitor like my mom.

<0> Monday I was downtown for work. I was on my way home when a homeless man asked form some money. I went to reach for my wallet and it was gone. <1> I am sorry to hear that.Is there a chance you forgot your wallet home? <0> No it was stolen. So when I went to reach for it. The homeless man could tell something was wrong. He actually paid for my train ticket home. I end up seeing him again today. Took him out to lunch and gave him some money. <1> That story could become a movie script. <0> Yeah it was an oddly amazing experience

What else do you know about red? <1> It's actually a primary color for the RGB and CMYK color model. <0> I learned about primary colors in school when I was little. <1> Well, the reason that Mars is red is because of the iron oxide on it.

The name is kind of strange though.  <1> Although some consider it to be religious apparently those involved prefer to think of it as spiritual or mind spirit and Body <0> How do people find it religious?  <1> It's an object that you attach meaning to and believe it will help you in life. What is it that interests you? <0> I love Disney movies. My favorite is Tangled.  <1> It's a very good movie. I have similar hair to the main girl character. Haha <0> I have been growing mine out for a while, but its no where as long. I love braiding though. Do you know neat braids? <1> Sure I do. That's my go to hair style.

<0> Hello, I am interested in hair coloring, or hair dyeing, It is cool to change hair color <1> I think it is too. I changed my hair color in the past from black to dark blonde, it was interesting. <0> did you bleach it to make it blonde? <1> Not really, I do not like bleaching, I just used a regular hair dye and surprisingly it worked, just turned out a different shade than expected. <0> Yes it can damage hair, it is so interesting 75% of women in some cities like Copenhagen use hair dye <1> This sounds like a lot. It doesn't surprise me though, women like change, it's boring to always look the same. <0> Yes it is, and there is huge money spent on it, like $1.9 billion in 2011 <1> Wow, well sometimes it's worth it to spend money on looks. Even though dyeing hair can damage hair permanently. It's hard to get back to natural color. <0> Yes It is, but when it is done professionally by hairdresser it can damage less <1> Yeah, I guess you are right!
<0> Hello! I really to eat pasta. <1> I do also when I visited Italy it was the best Italian cuisine.  <0> I meant to say, I love eating pasta. What type of pasta did you have in Italy? <1> I had the spaghetti with tomato and meat sauce so good.  <0> Sounds yummy! My favorite time of pasta noodles are penne noodles. Do you have a favorite? <1> I tried penne noodles it's best when you have Cincinnati chili with the noodles. <0> I am not familiar with Cincinnati chili. I'm assuming that is a type of chili you put in the noodles? <1> Yes, and it tastes really good when it's homemade you should give it a shot.
<0> My favorite car is the Italian sport car manufactured in Maranello ... the Ferrari!  What about you?  Do you like the Ferrari? <1> I like Ferraris, but I tend to enjoy Japanese cars more! What do you like about the Ferrari? <0> It's speed and sleek design!  Even its history is great.  In 1962, the Ferrari 250 GTO became the most expensive car in history.  And in 2014, Ferrari was rated the world's most powerful brand!  So, those are just a few reasons, I have many more.  Do you know much about the Ferrari? <1> I know a little, because I love cars, but you clearly know a lot more than me! What's your favorite model? <0> I'm more of a classic car guy.  So I like the 1962 model.  Interestingly, the Ferrari 20 GT SWB Breadvan was built to compete against the GTO at the 24 Hours of Le Mans Sportscar Championship races.  So, two Ferraris were competing in the '62 races!   <1> You sound like you know a lot about this stuff. Do you like other Italian cars too, or just the Ferrari? <0> I would just say that Ferrari is my favorite.  That Ferrari 250 was built by Ferrari from 1953 to 1964.  Eventually, it was replaced by the 275, then the 330.   <1> I see. Does the Ferrari team have a good history in the Le Mans competitions?
<0> I remember when the PS4 was first launching.  It was the first game console I ever ordered onilne and I was really looking forward to having it delivered. <1> What was it like when it showed up on your door? <0> I was watching the front door like a hawk,  and constantly checking for online tracking updates.  I kept worrying that someone would steal it of my porch if I didn't get it right away.
<0> Hi  <1> Hi, I was watching the movie Superman, the superhero that started off in comic books by DC Comics, do you like Superman? <0> yes, i love superman . He is the best hero of all time. <1> He was actually created by two high school students, Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster. That's a surprise, huh?
<0> i saw angeline jolie the other day <1> How did that go exactly?
<0> that happens , but being content with what love they had left for you is good ? <1> i suppose . its why i am in therapy . depression is real . <0> It's difficult to cope with. <1> Yeah, it is some days are good but not all. sigh <0> It really helps to have a job you love, my mother was a teacher and even when she felt down she was happy to always teach. <1> That true. school just ways down on the mind to get the dream job. <0> My dream job has always been to be a nascar driver. The first car I drove was a stickshift, my parents were able to teach me. <1> That seem nice but I don't know to drove a stick-shift. <0> It is not too difficult! you can always learn! <1> Yeah but I don't know anyone with a stick-shift. <0> That is a problem, haha. Maybe your future car could be one! <1> lol. I can only dream.
<0> i can't wait to see the next avengers movie!! <1> ME too. Marvel movies are the best. Im late I just saw wonderwomAN <0> Yeah,  and since the infinity war second part is going to answer all the mysteries,  it is going to be legendary <1> OH my word. I feel like I should watch them all over <0> Yeah, I feel like they are definitely worth a second watch!
<0> everything ! i am actually manly . but i've a secret i am hiding . <1> what is your secret that you have <0> My parent's don't know that I am gay <1> Well parents aren't important. Just be true to yourself and live your true will.  <0> I'm not worried about what they will think just don't know how to tell them <1> Why do you even have to. It doesnt have to be your identity, its just a preference. I say just life your life, dont worry about it
<0> I love dyeing my hair funky colors.  <1> yes me too, hair coloring can be done at home or by a professional, do you do yours at home? <0> I color mine at home with products from Sally's beauty supply <1> yeah i do mine at home also. this is a neat fact i never knew, at home coloring in the us reached 1.9 billion in 2011!  <0> Wow that seems like a really high number! I wonder what that has done to salon services <1> yeah thats crazy to think of how that affects the salons. when i was younger i always thought salons made really well, as im older, im finding out that they are not as well as i thought they were. 
<0> That's interesting!  Do you ride horses? <1> yes i ride horses that are trained and ridden for practical working purposes such as in police work or for controlling herd animals or on a ranch <0> How long have you been doing that work? <1> I started out riding my mom when I was a wee lad.  <0> Lovely.  And you're very skilled at that? <1> I'm self taught actually. An hour everyday for a year now. <0> That sounds like a lot of hard work. <1> Yes it is depending on the individual horse. There is a tremendous amount of controversy over various training techniques. <0> Which training technique do you prefer? <1> Karate mainly, Its such a good stress relief too! I hope we actually get paid for this
<0> A good co-worker of mine lost his job <1> That is not good,  what happened <0> His boss felt he was under-performing.  It's a shame because he was fun to work with <1> That is never a good thing,  I hope they land on their feet <0> I hope so. He was so hardworking.
<0> Wow that is interesting.  Are they easy to grow? I would love to try. <1> Yes they really are. I actually have cinderblocks going around my garden area and they come out of the holes in them every year. Without having to replant.  <0> What agricultural zone do you live in? I'm afraid the frost would kill them in my area. <1> I live up north actually, so I am only able to garden in the summer months. Its a short season! <0> I live in the south, so if you have good luck growing strawberries up north, it sounds like I should have no problem. <1> It should be easy!  It grows quick and you can consume them in large quantities.  Strawberries are super delicious with chocolate. <0> That's a great idea! I think chocolate strawberries and a night on the beach are an example of a perfect day for me. <1> that sounds like a great combination . <0> What is your idea of a perfect day? <1> I like to kayak - so any day I can get out on the water is a perfect day to me! <0> Fishing from a kayak is one of my favorite things to do. Especially in the evening. <1> Do you own your own kayak or do you rent?
<0> My high heel broke in the cement the other morning and I had to wear them all day at work. Not a good day! <1> Sounds like something on a movie! What a work day right,  my god. Bring extras next time? lol  <0> Yeah,  from now on I will have an extra pair in my desk. Everyone was teasing me all day. It was so annoying! <1> I bet they were lol atleast you can laugh about it now.  <0> i'm still mad, can't even laugh.
<0> I haven't listened to much Jazz at all but I think I've heard some of Monk and he's quite talented. Who would you say your biggest Jazz inspirations are? <1> Jazz bands are different sizes but ones of my favorites was a big band guy, Lenny Hambro. <0> He was a good one, I would have to say billie holiday <1> She was wonderful and her songs had such meaning and emotion. <0> Yes, I agree. What kind of music do you like listening to the most? <1> I really love jazz and also classical music. Those are my favorites. What about you? <0> Don't laugh; pop and some jazz.
<0> I don't know much about gun laws. I live in Texas, so there are a lot of people with firearms. Do the laws vary by state? <1> Yes they do vary by the state you live in it is defines by 2 groups gun control and gun rights. I feel like in my state the laws need to be much stricter on guns. <0> Texas is very liberal about open carry law. But I'd rather know if someone has and weapon and can see. Those people aren't the worry. <1> Texas is a great place! I can understand the need to want to be prepared especially in the world today. It's hard to feel safe out in public. <0> Yes sir, the world is very dangerous and you need to protect yourself!
<0> hello , how are you this morning ? <1> not good . things in my life are not going well . <0> i am so sorry to hear that . have you tried listening to taylor swift ? <1> music is not going to bring my wife and kids back !
<0> I love sushi, especially if it has smoked salmon in it <1> yes but it  is often served with pickled ginger, wasabi, and soy sauce. <0> Which of those don't you like? <1> Wasabi and you? <0> I like it all, sushi is my fave <1> Which sushi is your favorite? <0> I really like anything with salmon in it <1> Does the california roll have salmon in it? <0> I think its normally crab, but if youre making it yourself, who knows!
<0> I am bored of my maids. <1> Why? The word maid is short for maiden, meaning virgin. Do you know how that evolved into someone cleaning the house? <0> I don't know I just need a change I guess. How did that evolve into someone who cleans a house? <1> I'm not sure. I was hoping you knew. In Victorian times the maids were expected to remain unmarried. <0> Why did they need to remain unmarried? <1> Because they needed to devote all their time to the household. Even the highest-ranking workers, like butlers, could be dismissed if they married. <0> WoW! I did not know that. That's almost equivalent to a slave! <1> It sure is. They used to suffer from bursitis because of all the time spent on their knees scrubbing and lighting the fires.
<0> I once had a fluffy cat named Leo,  but he got lymphoma and I had to have him put to sleep. <1> Oh,  I am so sorry. It has to be the most difficult thing to have to do. I had to do that with my gorgeous lab - I still miss him! <0> I'm sorry to hear about your lab as well. They are very sweet dogs. <1> Indeed they are. And so are many cats - the farm I used to live on has a ginger tom. He's quite the character and used to visit me regularly! <0> I love ginger cats! Leo was a ginger,  and I have one right now named Chunk. <1> This fella is called Oliver. He's a big old softie who is ace at catching gophers. He would bring half eaten ones to my door!
<0> hello , there ! having a good day ? <1> hello ! i'm having an okay day . how about you ? <0> i'm a bit tired . i have been training for an upcoming marathon all evening <1> oh wow . i don't run much . how is that ? <0> it is tough but keeps me healthy . what are you into ? <1> Some people say that I'm the best they've ever seen at sitting on a couch and watching television.
<0> I'm thinking of making a key lime pie today. I love baking!  <1> Me too. A baker bakes and often sells breads using an oven or other heated device. <0> I'm just a humble home baker. I make things just for my family and friends to enjoy.  <1> Grains have been popular for a thousand or more years, so baking is a very old practice. <0> I never stopped to think about it! I guess they would have baked over open fire.  <1> By the sixth century AD, the Greeks would use ovens heated by wood fires and communities baked in a big ol' communal oven. <0> Imagine that! Sounds kind of cool, but also probably a pain to have to wait your turn! <1> It must have been fun, imagine baking enough bread for a small town in Greece every day.
<0> I've never seen it. What is it about? <1> The film was set in 1757 New York, during the French and Indian war <0> Very interesting! I love New York <1> i like new york, well atleast what i have seen in movies and tv. <0> You have to visit someday! I've been three times, it's like no other city out there. <1> What's your favorite thing about it?
<0> I was watching TV and was just thinking about how much I wish friends was still on the air. I miss that show.  <1> You could always watch it online! <0> really? I didn't know that  <1> It will be available on Netflix in a few years. <0> Wow, That's nice. <1> Yeah. Lots of old shows area available on streaming platforms nowadays or will be in the future.
<0> A friend borrowed some video games of mine <1> nice,  what system do you play on?
<0> I once swam with a Manta Ray when I was on vacation in Florida. <1> No way? That's the rays in the genus "manta" right? What was it like? <0> Well I didn't realize it was there until I looked down.  It didn't seem to acknowledge my presenad and kept looking for more fish to eat. <1> Wow, that must have been amazing. There are two varieties of the rays, one larger and another a bit smaller. Do you know how big yours was? <0> A Smaller one.  I think I would have noticed a bigger one earlier. <1> They are normally found in warm climates and tropical / sub tropical waters. I wish I could see them where I am! <0> Yeah a lot of people at the beach where I was had seen them a lot more in the summer than winter. <1> That would make sense because they prefer warmer temperatures.
<0> I absolutely love to bake! It is one of my favorite hobbies! I like baking cookies, cases, and breads. <1> Really! I'm not really into baking. But I do have several different hobbies. <0> That's nice! You should give baking a try. Also, baking can be combined with grilling to produce a hybrid barbeque variant by using both methods simultaneously. <1>  Interesting! I've tried baking before, but I was little kidWhen I lasted it.I really like to use my grill for grilling meats. But I have heard that you can "bake" pizza dough on a grill. <0> Yes, you absolutely can, and it tastes wonderful that way! Likewise, you can always bake your meats to make them more tender rather than fry them, etc.  <1> Hmm, So, what equipment do you need in order to cook a pizza on the grill? <0> Not much, other than a pan to put it on so it doesn't fall through the rails. Ha!  <1> LOL, That makes sense. So, going back to general baking. What do you like to bake?
<0> The milk I drank this mornign went bad! <1> That's no good,  did you throw it out?
<0> i love going to comedy clubs. I am thinking about going to Carolines on Broadway <1> I'm jealous, that sounds fun!  It's one of the most established stand-up clubs in the U.S. <0> is it actually on Broadway or is sort of close to broadway <1> Yep, It's on Broadway between 49th and 50th Street. <0> so you say it is established, how long has it been around? <1> Caroline Hirsch herself opened her eponymous caberet in Chelsea, in 81'. <0> so what kind of comedians do they have, more named comedians or newer comedians? <1> Dennis Miller has performed there before.  He was born in 1953.
<0> Do you have to be standing on the board while riding a wave to be considered surfing? <1> Not at all.  A lot of people prefer body boarding, which you can do by laying on the board or just dropping down to one knee <0> Have you been doing this a long time, you sound pretty educated on it. <1> Not really.  I just started doing it again this year.  I used to fish as a kid all the time. <0> I enjoy going fishing also, so peaceful. But gardening is my favorite hobby <1> Gardening can be considered relaxing, but it seems like you might be too relaxed it they plants are all dying! <0> I don't have a green thumb that's for sure, but I just enjoy it. Do you have any hobbies? <1> My favorite hobby besides gardening is horseback riding. <0> Horses are so beautiful, I haven't been around one since I was a kid. <1> Me as well and I really love the Blue Valentine and Hancock bred quarter horses. <0> I do not know much about them, wish I could be around them more. Would love to go riding again. <1> You should!  Maybe you could find a trail riding nearby or take lessons.  Horseback riding is good for the soul and balancing your body as well. <0> Sounds like a great plan, I need to look into it. Thanks for chatting! <1> Yeah you definitely should! 
<0> Do you remember that show I was telling you about the other day? It's getting a new season! <1> Remind me,  which show was that?
<0> My daughter has learned to read and it is so rewarding to see her continue to grow! <1> Thats great news. <0> Yea, my mom and step mom love when I call and let her read to them. <1> Aww that's very sweet, you must be proud <0> I am very proud. Its the Chicago in me.  <1> Do you celebrate halloween there? i don't celebrate holidays <0> We do actually, taking her trick or treating tonight.  <1> what is she dressing up as? <0> That princess from frozen. <1> Elsa? My niece is crazy about her!
<0> MY kid loves her new school and she doesnt like anything! <1> Don't be daft! Kids should never watch tv! <0> why not? <1> depending on their age - you have to monitor what they watch - some are just so inappropriate <0> Yes, you are right. I prefer Youtube, I get to restrict the inappropriate content  <1> yes - easier to control <0> also it is full of cats videos! <1> I don't watch cat videos - but like the practical jokes ones <0> What's your job? <1> I work for an accountant here in town. Are you married.
<0> I visited some historical sites in Utah last month. A lot of the prehistoric art was red. That's one of my favorite colors :) <1> Oh really? I like red too. I think my favorite shade is cherry red. <0> There's so many shades to choose from lol. I like all of them from pale red to dark red burgundy. I think my favorite is vermillion, though. <1> I've never heard of vermillion. Is that a dark or light red? <0> It is a very bright shade. Not too light and not too dark. A smidge lighter that Crayola red. <1> Ah okay. It would be cool to have a Ferrari made in that color. <0> It would!! I've always wanted a green sports car though. Large variety of shades of green too haha. I want an emerald colored car. <1> I've seen those green cars that change shades if you look at it from a different angle. Those are cool. <0> Yesss! My friend was showing me videos of some of them the other day. They're so awesome! <1> What got you into wanting a sports car?
<0> I have a special dinner arranged for me and my husband this week. <1> That's wonderful. He'll be so excited when he finds out! <0> Yes he will it's his birthday and we can have a night alone no kids just a nice dinner. <1> I hope you guys have a great time. Just the two of you. <0> Thank you!
<0> I am learning how to do day trading and did my first trade and I won <1> Well that sounds like a high stress occupation! <0> You think? It sure is exciting,  at least when I win. <1> I'm glad you like it. I think it would be hard to get it right every time the way the market is sometimes. <0> Your right. Let's see how I do next week. <1> I wish you the very best with it all!
<0> What is your favorite color, I like red. Its a primary color model. <1> I love red too!  <0> Its next to orange on the spectrum and opposite of violet. <1> Really? What about pink? I like pink too.. is there red in pink? <0> Yes, there is a pale red pink out there. <1> Oh nice! <0> If you are into sunsets, there is a red color that is caused by iron oxide. <1> I am into sunsets! I did notice there was red in them, but wasnt sure!
<0> well there's shrimp gumbo , shrimp cresol , ship scampi <1> oh yeah shrimp is like the shrimp of the shrimp <0> Haha, that's definitely one way of putting it. As a classically trained chef, I really enjoy working with shrimp. <1> Since I cut out meat, I really miss shrimp. <0> Cut out meat? Did you do it for health or ethical reasons? <1> A little bit of both.  I really needed to cut down on red meat especially, and I was reading about all the water it takes to raise meat. <0> I've heard that as well. I try not to think about it, I have male pattern baldness and the stress of things I have little control over don't help! <1> Male pattern baldness?  What's that? <0> It's basically the way a male loses hair, you start losing hair at the hairline and it keeps going up from there. <1> I've noticed my hair is getting thinner lately.  Never used to be a problem.  Comes with age, I guess.
<0> I think everyday how fortunate I am to have a house, car, food, water and air to breathe. There are so many people in the world who don't even have clean water to drink <1> You are so right. Even some of the worst conditions in my home country are better than most. <0> Agreed. When I'm having a bad day, I think about how bad the people in third world countries have it. <1> we need to more for them, you dont see enough of it on social media <0> So true. It amazes me how much people fail to realize their fortunes. I watch people in bars act like they have not a single care in the world. <1> agreed <0> Being an angry person already, it just makes matters worse, ya know? <1> you are so right there i suppose <0> It makes me want to be more approachable so I can inform people on the horrors other countries have to endure. <1> yeah i would love to see how the rest of the world lives <0> Hopefully one day we all can. Like the people in Venezuela who are without food, water and many without electricity! <1> i know that's so horrible . so many have perished already <0> Yeah true, so many lives have been lost already and no one seems to care!
<0> I love rock and roll music.  Do you know much about the genre? <1> It's a genre of popular music that came about in the United States around the late 40s/early 50s, from African American musical styles, like gospel, jump blues, jazz, boggie woogie, and with some country music thrown into the mix! <0> So it has a lot of influences.  When was rock music the most popular? <1> Perhaps in the 1950s and mid 1960s, as this was the time when the "more encompassing international style" of rock music came about <0> Is rock and roll still popular today?   <1> It's hard to say. However, radio stations have much success playing classic rock and roll, which is a sub genre that usually has one or two electric guitars, a double bass or string bass or electric bass guitar, and a drum kit. <0> I used to listen to the rock band Rolling Stones.  Are they still around today? <1> They are! Even though they were formed in 1962 and have had a long list of line-up changes, they're still around today, with Mick Jagger still leading the band.
<0> Once I was going to get fried chicken,  but then I remembered I was loyal to only eating vegetables <1> Wait,  you forgot you're vegetarian? That must've been pretty shocking <0> My girlfriend makes me! And she is always watching! <1> Oooo you have to be sneaky with your meat habits,  my friend

What is you favorite thing to bake or what is your best seller? <1> I think wheat bread and I work at a local bakery <0> Interesting, I figured it would have been something sweet like a pie or a cake.  <1> Nope, and baking is goint to be around forever,  Since grains have been a staple food for millennia <0> What other kinds of flour do you use there besides wheat flour? <1> There is also almond flour and coconut flour.

<0> Science Fiction often predicts future inventions, t is an act of creative imagination. <1> Yes, you said that right, a lot of Star Wars, or Star trek inventions became a reality  <0> The difference to fantasy is that it avoids the supernational and often has a foundation in actual science. I love Star Trek as well.  <1> Yes, science fiction can predict the future, but a lot of other shows also, like The Simpsons predicted the Ebola outbreak, have you heard of that? <0> No, tell me more about it. Isn't Ebola this dangerous virus that can cause internal and external bleeding. <1> Yes it is, and the Simpsons predicted it in one of their sketches that was filmed back in 1997! <0> Interesting relationship there between science fiction in a series such as "The Simpsons" and global events. <1> I don't see any relationship between the two, The Simpsons has never predicted future events.

<0> Yea, it was a little sad to realise that it was not normal. A good father-figure role is always needed. <1> Though less common in literature than evil stepmothers, there are also cases of evil "stepfathers was that your case? <0> He never really treated me like I was apart of the family. <1> Yeah some people are just like that. Stepfathers who are like this have a presence in literature but less common then the whole mean stepmother thing. <0> Very true! <1> My step farther ignored me for the most part , I see it as a blessing in disguise however ! Step father's am I right LOL  <0> Definitely the best way to look at it, a blessing in disguise. <1> I could never see myself considering anyone else apart from my real dad , may be old fashioned but that’s how it goes with me , what about you ? <0> My real dad wasn't really in the picture either then I got stuck with this goofball.

What type of workouts would you recommend for some serious weight loss? Ive been wanting to up my game lately.  <0> For weight loss, anything that gets the heart rate up works. You don't need to build muscle to lose weight, simple jumping jacks or high knees will suffice and also helps your body to resist hypokinetic diseases <1> Oh ok thanks for the tips, Ill have to try some of those. I am a pretty big guy so I guess ill have to start light and then work my way up. What about dietary supplements, Any you would recommend?

<0> hello how are you today ? <1> hi . okay . heartburn . 2 months until i am due . the twins are restless tonight . <0> that is funny , i do not get along with my wife <1> oh , no . sorry to hear that . hubby and i disagree once in a while about the kids . <0> we fight about our cat , spook <1> yeah . well , i wish you luck there . we bought a cute 2 story house . <0> nice , i don't think i have ever left ohio
<0> It is. I never got a master's. What is your highest level of education? <1> Just a BSc. The MBA degree originated in the United States in the early 20th century when the country industrialized <0> Interesting, are you a History buff? <1> No, not much but I did a lot of American history through school. How about you? <0> Never was much into History.  I studied Criminal Justice in school. <1> Sounds fascinating! Did you go into law, or maybe some type of enforcement employment? <0> My dream job was Forensics but I currently work for an offender rehabilitation program. What do you do? <1> I'm in language teaching part-time, which funds my business studies courses at college. Forensics always seems interesting, but I probably watch too much American TV. Are you enjoying your job? <0> I do enjoy my work. I also like watching Forensic/Crimes shows. I am guessing you are not in the US? <1> Ah, no. I'm in Russia. <0> Have you ever visited the states?
<0> My sister in law brought our first girl into the family, the wait seemed like forever <1> Congratulations, always nice to have a new addition to the family! <0> it sure is. It all happens so fast! my kid is already talking in her sleep and enjoys folk metal just like her dad! <1> That is awesome. Your kiddo will be talking your ear off in no time. <0> oh yeah, tell me about it. How long did you guys wait before having your kid? <1> We waited 3 years.  <0> That's a long time. Ours was a surprise. But hey, it happens. Does it get harder when they become teens?  <1> I don't know, we haven't been able to succeed in having children yet.
<0> Right now I have purple hair, have you ever dyed your hair? <1> i died it blonde once, never again. <0> I know you can go from light to dark blonde, which way did you dye it? <1> from light to even lighter <0> Do you have light skin or is your family from Europe? <1> yes i am very white, german <0> Both of my parents have relatives in Europe so with those genes I am very fair skinned.
<0> I love comedy clubs and I've always wanted to go to one specific one on Times Square called Carolines on Broadway. Heard of it? <1> I haven't, I've heard of one called The Comedy Store I think in California, but I might be getting the name wrong. <0> I think I've heard of that, so I think not. Well Carolines on Broadway is one of the most recognized stand-up comedy clubs in the whole US. <1> Oh interesting. Comedy clubs are great, it gives aspiring comedians a chance to practice their skills. Are you familiar with Joe Rogan? <0> Yeah, he's a little arrogant and rude but I like what I've seen of him. Tons of people have performed at Carolines on Broadway, like Louis CK and Jerry Seinfeld. <1> Sounds like a place for the big stars. I only mention Joe Rogan because that's where I heard of The Comedy Store. I'm also a big UFC fan, do you watch? <0> I've watched very little UFC, personally. But yeah there's been Jim Norton and Bill Burr there too. <1> I am not a fan of comedy
<0> I feel bad I stole a cookie from the cookie jar. <1> oh no. Did you get rid of the evidence? <0> no <1> what flavor was the cookie? <0> chocolate ,my favorite flavor  <1> my favorite cookie is chocolate chip . yum <0> we both have the same taste <1> Have you ever had oreos? <0> yes ofcourse, oreo is my favorite one . you also love it <1> I love oreos and milk, apparently Oreos have been the best selling cookie here for over 100 years
<0> i love my parents to death we grew up poor, but we always had all the basic stuff needed for school and clothing <1> Your parents sound like wonderful people! <0> Yeah those two gals gave me quite the push to win in life! <1> My parents also raised me well and were always around, I feel bad for children who suffered from neglect due to various things like substance abuse, unemployment, etc. <0> you're right. I wish I had more time to help out kids in need like that. We should totally volunteer as big brothers! <1> Yes, that sounds like a great idea! I would totally be down to do something like that. <0> we just have to pick a date on when we're going sign up or else I'm gonna forget, honestly one of the few bad character traits that I have. <1> For sure. That's okay, that's what friends are for, to help you where you lack. <0> Lets pledge our friendship to the skies and get friendship rings to show the world that we are brothers!
<0> Oh there are so many but i did love Cover Girl or Pal Joey. She starred in a total of 61 films.  Isnt that amazing? <1> Oh nice! I love Frank Sinatra in Pal Joey. My favorite is Gilda, the 1946 film noir. Have you seen it? <0> I have not, what is it about? <1> It's about this dude locked away in jail that might be the devil <0> Wow, sounds scary.  I may have to check it out sometime! <1> I think it's a super fun but weird old movie. Avoid it if you don't like clowns though <0> Clowns? No thank you! <1> Yeah they generally freak me out too. So what do you do for a living?
<0> I have brown hair, quite common I guess. <1> Yeah it is, it is the second most common, after black, which I have. <0> And what is the least common hair color? <1> I would say it is red hair since only 1-2% of the population has it. It's a shame because it is very pretty. <0> Yes It is.  I guess that is why some people dye their hair red.   Do you know what makes hair a specific color? <1> It has to do with pigment. So high levels of eumelanin makes the hair dark while lower levels of pheomelanin make the hair lighter. <0> Interesting.  And any idea what makes some hair curly? <1> I'm not sure I would think genetics. People that have brown hair are usually called brunette's. Do you get called that?
<0> I love Gospel music,it inspires me alot <1> Me too! It usually involves dominant vocals and harmony, which is the best part about it. I'm really not into the God part personally. <0> How about you favorite gospel artist? <1> I actually haven't heard a lot of gospel singers. What is yours? Gospel music goes waaay back to the 17th century. <0> Fred Hammond, don't Moen et al, you can name yours too.Guess you have the information already? <1> I just don't know specific artists. I do love Southern gospel the most, which is a type of Christian music. <0> So there are classifications of Christian music. Do you know them? <1> No, I don't know them
<0> hi , want to get to know each other ? <1> yes , i've a job at a nursing home and on facebook a lot . <0> i can not have a facebook account yet . i am 8 <1> i have a son who is 8 he lives with his mom , she left me . <0> that's sad , but i bet he gets two christmas days each year <1> yes he does , even though i don't really believe in god . <0> that's fine santa will still visit him . santa brought me a big mickey last year <1> how cool ! mickey is a pretty cool dude . <0> oh yeah ! we go to disney world a lot . i love splash mountain <1> that's cool i do not go to parks i need to lose weight . <0> you could still go . they have those cool wheelchairs you can borrow

<0> Red is my favorite color - especially crimson red. What is your favorite shade of red? <1> i like ruby <0> I also love pink- which is actually a very light shade of red. It's a mixture of white and red. Men used to sometimes wear pink suits because, as a watered down shade of red, I signified passion or anger tempered by self-control <1> i like pink as well. i also like yellow <0> What shade of yellow do you prefer? I like pale pastel yellow, because it reminds me of spring time! <1> i like that and canary yellow <0> How about blue? My favorite type of blue is sapphire, because it's a jewel tone.
<0> My girlfriend is moving in this weekend.  This is the first relationship I have had that actually will be living with me. <1> Are you excited for it?
<0> good evening . what are you up to ? <1> hello , how are you ? i am well . i like to shop for shoes and watches . <0> i don't shop much . prefer to relax at home with my cow . <1> what do you do ? i'm work for a watch dealer . <0> no wonder you like watches ! i'm a commercial electrician <1> wonderful ! yeah , however , my family does not support my choice of career . <0> why not ? family is important . <1> i'm not sure why they do not . do you like cars ? <0> i do ! i love trucks especially . i drive a big f 250
<0> I used to have quite the issue with overeating, especially since I had no idea how much calories were in certain foods. <1> I know what you mean. Certain foods can be addicting too. and that is the compulsive consumption of a high fat and high sugar food or foods which activate a reward center in the brain <0> Yeah, they're so much easier to access than before since sweet foods are thought of by the body as occasional treats. <1> Compulsive over eaters depend too much on food to comfort themselves when they are stressed or depressed.  <0> Yeah, it seems to occasionally be linked to things like depression as well. <1> The 12 step program helps over eaters also, not just for alcoholics or drug addicts.
<0> my wife stays home so she can get pretty crazy . <1> have some income i don't want to share , investments <0> Why because now she is pregnent... <1> You need to pamper her <0> yes, she well about the things what to do and what not to do.. <1> So what do you do to support her? <0> i appoined one care taker... <1> A caretaker? How does that work <0> she work in only 6 hours
<0> I get feel so irate when I lose any form of game. <1> Me too! I like to win, I guess that makes me competitive. <0> have you been always co competitive? <1> Yes, I love a good challenge! It's fun. <0> I don't know, sometimes I feel it brings out the worst in people. <1> For some yes. Healthy competition is a good thing I think <0> As long as no finance is involved, I deem it not to be harmful at all <1> I agree. I don't put finances in it at all. <0> Some of my husbands friends lost tons of money on online sports bets, however some made good money <1> I don't have enough extra money to gamble like that. Plus I'm not lucky.
<0> i was delighted with how well my nephew did at his little league game <1> Did his team win?
<0> one time I realized the milk I bought was expired, I went back to the store to buy more only to realized it was expired too. <1> Wow sounds like you need a new store..haha <0> definitely. its the closest to me so i often go there to get things <1> Milk substitute might help, have you tried that? <0> no i haven't. whats that? <1> It's an alternative to regular milk. Such as soy, almond, etc. <0> i'm skeptical about trying new things. I get a lot of Allergies
<0> I went through my closet the other day and found all these old writings and drawings I did when I was in elementary school. It was fun remembering being that little,  how different the world was. <1> I've done that before... I enjoyed it too! I love looking back at old pictures and stuff <0> Did your parents save a lot of your school work like mine did? I'm surprised how much my mom kept! <1> Some of it but my grandma did save a lot.  I plan on doing that with my kids <0> thats a good idea. i might do the same. my grandmother always saved everything i did.
<0> Do you enjoy any water sports like Kayaking? <1> I like some water sports including Kayaking but overall I prefer sports on land. <0> Personally I love Scuba Diving. Only done it once in my life but you never forget the experience.  <1> Where did you go scuba diving? was the introductory training difficult? <0> I Scuba Dived in the bahamas on vacation. No the training only took about an hour.  <1> Oh really, You must be good at it.
<0> I left my young daughter with my friend. I totally trust her though,  she will be a great mom someday! <1> thats awesome that you trust her <0> yeah she is a great person.  she is a little younger than me. <1> its hard to find good people you can trust with your kids nowadays <0> yea the world is such a crazy place
<0> My favorite color is red. It is at the end of the visible spectrum of light. I love how bright it is. <1> I like red as well, it reminds me of pokemon red <0> I like Pokemon as well. Red's first big defeat was when he failed to capture Mew. <1> Yeah, those games were revolutionary, i still go back and play them often <0> Mew's first film appearance was as a main character with Mewtwo. I love those characters. <1> That was a fantastic movie, it was the first one if I remember it correctly
<0> My daughter has learned to read and it is so rewarding to see her continue to grow! <1> Thats great news. <0> Yea, my mom and step mom love when I call and let her read to them. <1> Aww that's very sweet, you must be proud <0> I am very proud. Its the Chicago in me.  <1> Do you celebrate halloween there? i don't celebrate holidays <0> We do actually, taking her trick or treating tonight.  <1> what is she dressing up as? <0> maybe like a clown since she can't read yet.
<0> Seems like hair coloring is really popular among college girls from what I've seen. <1> Changing hair color seems to be pretty big among some demographics <0> Yeah definitely, it may be controversial but it seems like bisexual/transgender/gay women do it all the time, at least from what I've seen. <1> Many hair colorings are done professionally. <0> It must look really good when done by a pro. <1> I agree, but sometimes it can be done independently within the home. <0> Oh I know, I dyed my hair once for a gag haha. <1> Hair dyeing is a modern art form almost, it seems <0> That's quite bold but fair. <1> I've dyed my hair so many times that I'm almost a professional at this point.
<0> hello , how are you today ? <1> i am very well thank you . how are you today ? <0> i'm great . i just got back from a nice long walk . <1> i'm thinking of retiring soon so i will be able to walk more . <0> it is a fantastic way to clear your mind and get exercise at the same time . <1> do you like to travel ? i have been to spain several times . <0> i do like to travel , though i've not been to spain . <1> it is hard to do on a librarians salary sometimes . <0> i can understand the struggle <1> do you have any hobbies or a job ? <0> i've a craft business that i run out of my house <1> interesting . i bet you get a lot of 60 year old clients like myself . <0> not really . most of my clients are millennial vegans .
<0> i love going to comedy clubs. I am thinking about going to Carolines on Broadway <1> I'm jealous, that sounds fun!  It's one of the most established stand-up clubs in the U.S. <0> is it actually on Broadway or is sort of close to broadway <1> Yep, It's on Broadway between 49th and 50th Street. <0> so you say it is established, how long has it been around? <1> Caroline Hirsch herself opened her eponymous caberet in Chelsea, in 81'. <0> ohh, thats so cool. 
<0> I can bake a mean cake. Have you ever baked? <1> Oh yeah, baking is a lot of fun since I love cooking food. <0> What do you like to bake? I have made bread from scratch <1> I really love baking and cooking up cakes and bread. <0> That sounds delicious. I need to bake more <1> Same, but it takes a lot of heat and like hot ashes or stones. <0> Heat is essential to so much food! <1> Definitely, things like hot ashes and stones can cook it and kill bacteria. <0> I bet that it is important for sanitation
<0> I can't show my face in the bank ever again! <1> Oh my goodness,  what happened? Did they find out you owe money to the local crime families? Those bank employees need to mind their own business,  am I right!?
<0> Thank you. I hope it's something that he will get over soon. <1> You're welcome. It's always nerve wrecking when family is sick like that. <0> 5 <1> I think there might be something wrong with the platform at the moment. <0> I just really want him to suffer
<0> short stories , for halloween <1> are those stories creepy or not ? <0> yeah they really are. Kinda like horror books.  <1> horror movies are a good way to take your mind of of things <0> That's one way to look at it. Do you like to read or watch movies more? <1> Like to read more especially if it is Stephen King.  What about you? <0> Same here. Love to read. Though on a rainy day it could go either way. <1> Yes, same here.  Do you like Stephen King? <0> Somewhat. Do you like Dean Koontz?
<0> i think i will lose my tooth, i am afraid <1> Whys that?! is it rotting out? <0> No it just hurts and can't get in the dentist for some time. <1> I'm sorry to hear that.  Tooth pain is something awful to have to deal with. <0> Yes it is but I will be fine, just one of those things. Speaking of tooth pain, do you have halloween plans? <1> I plan to hide in my basement with my two boxers and watch scary movies. <0> Oh fun! My mom has a boxer. I am taking my little girl trick or treating. <1> Do you live somewhere with lots of trick-or-treaters? It sounds like fun. <0> No I live in the country so you have to drive in town <1> Oh yes, I used to live in the country when I was little and I remember having to drive in for trick-or-treating. <0> Yes it has some benefits though. <1> It definitely does. I miss living in the country. <0> How far did you have to drive? <1> I'd have to drive for about half an hour.
<0> I often incorporate drawing into what I do for a living, and LOVE a good marker! Do you create any art in any way? <1> I like to draw or sketch with graphite  but I am not very good with it. <0> Graphite is a great medium -- I love the smudginess it can give. Do you experiment with different hardness to get varying effects? And what paper do you prefer? <1> I just use a normal pencil mostly because I just doodle.  I use just regular paper <0> Doodling is a *great* way to think! Have you ever looked into sketchnoting? It's a visual way to capture information, and makes listening a lot more interesting and fun. <1> I have never heard of that and will have to check it out.  I love the google doodle that they put on their homepage <0> Agreed! They have Doodler-in-Chief at Google who shepherds the process. You might want to check out "The Doodle Revolution", or any of Mike Rohde's books. <1> Interesting.  I will have to check it out.  I have the video game doodle jump on my phone <0> Do you have a labradoodle? (Ha ha....) Have fun and let your creativity flooooow. No judgement! <1> Haha that is a good one! I will try my best.
<0> that sounds interesting. i know nothing about sculpting <1> Well it's very interesting. It's another branch of the visual arts that operates in three dimensions as opposed to the traditional two dimension art forms. <0> I hear you as I'm an artist and love to create with mind and hands.
<0> how did you end up in a wheel chair <1> a four wheeler accident . <0> Sorry to hear that. I have heard four wheelers can be dangerous. <1> yes you have to be careful I learned the hard way ,on a slip on a hill <0> If that happened to me, my wife would take away my vehicle. Are you married? <1> No I am not , glad I am not it would be a burden on the marriage  <0> I understand. I get lectures from my wife all the time. Honestly I'm not afraid of what she thinks. Sometimes fun is worth an angry wife. <1> I bet you get in trouble a lot with your wife lol <0> Lol. She wears the pants in the family. But she makes great spaghetti so I can tolerate her. <1> I know your wife is cool
<0> I enjoy rock and roll music. I recently took a trip to the Rock and Roll hall of fame which was fantastic. Do you like rock music? <1> I do! I especially love Classic Rock and the sound of the electric guitars <0> YEah, Led Zepplin, The Guess Who- those guys were great. Modern rock is so different. I can't stand Fall Out Boy, for example.  <1> I agree! Some of the new type of music nowadays I just don't understand. I miss just the classic saxophone or piano in some of the current music. <0> It seems like all music is auto-tuned these days- you would never have heard that in Classic Rock.  <1> I have been introducing my teenagers to some of the old classic rock and I have actually caught them listening to it without me. Definitely the kind of music we need to keep alive! <0> That's so true! I see lots of classic rock t-shirts on teens but I suspect they've never heard the music.  <1> I agree! I miss the days of MTV and all of the great music videos
<0> Is it above ground? <1> It's an in-ground pool located in my back yard. <0> that's amazing. can I bring my dogs? their pretty much my best friends. <1> Sure bring your dogs. It will give the pool boy even more cleaning to do and the more time he's here the better ;) <0> What about hiring a magician? I know a guy. he's just like penn teller. This party is going to be great! <1> I'd rather not have a party. I like to keep things intimate.
<0> I was sweeping the living room today and found a roach! Ugh. <1> Gross! Out of all the bugs that I find in my house,  those would be the worse.
<0> hi i'm jerry and i have a phobia over scorpions <1> why do you have that <0> its what i fear . my father is a nascar drive <1> that must be really interesting <0> my german shepherd is barnaby <1> did you name him after someone <0> hmm . . . no it was a name given from the shelter . i love the color grey <1> so you adopted him ? that is great . <0> we adopted him at a shelter <1> are you married or for your kid <0> no kids single and live alone <1> I'm single also, hope to have kids some day.
<0> hey do you know much about Niagara Falls? <1> I've actually visited Niagara Falls. It's three waterfalls between USA and Canada. <0> Oh thats cool, what state/area is it in? <1> It borders the city of Buffalo-Niagara Falls, NY, USA and Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada. <0> oh wow didnt know it was i/next to new york, how long has it been an attraction? <1> It's a natural attraction, so it's been around before people settled there. <0> how many people visit it? is it really popular? <1> According to the sources provided, there are peak tourists times at Niagara Falls.
<0> Which is your favourite character from the Avenger movies?  <1> I love all of them. And their famous battle cry of "Avengers Assemble is awesome <0> It is pretty awesome. What did you think of the Black Panther movie? <1> I loved it a lot. I went to see it with my boyfriend when it was new. <0> That movie was casted perfectly. I really hope they make a sequel. <1> I do too. I always hope that they'll film a blockbuster movie where I live but I don't think they'll ever come to Portland. <0> Oregon? I could see something getting filmed out there. All you have to do is pitch it to the right person. ;) <1> That's true. The trouble is knowing the right person. Hahaha. <0> Yea, it's tough to start finding that. I usually just go through social media until I get a good lead. <1> That sounds like a plan for sure. I will have to try it out some time. <0> Perseverance is the key, as with anything. I know you can do it! <1> Thanks for that. I'm starting to feel more confident that maybe it will actually work. <0> Yeah, you never know what can happen.
<0> two full sleeves of tatoos , got them done in la <1> i've almost a full body suit . . . mostly japanese influenced <0> What do you do for a living then? I work as a freight driver and find that loads of us have them..... <1> I sell insurance, so I get to work from home a lot. I am a homebody that likes to sit on the couch and watch TV. <0> Have your employers been accepting of your tats, when they do see you at an office ?  <1> Oh yes, but I do cover them up as much as I can when I go into the office. Working at home helps me with that situation also. <0> Shame to cover them, luckily I don't have to. WHy Japanese influenced ? <1> I love the artwork and creativity. <0> It is very unique and beautiful for sure. As a woman I appreciate that style ! <1> What are your tattoos of, origin or reasons? <0> Well, my first one was the hand print of my daughter as a baby, then I had three more children so had to add them. One led to another.... <1> I want to add one for my son soon, I love the silhouette ones of mother and child. <0> Would you like more Japanese influenced ones?

<0> I love Ferraris, and Italian sports cars in general. <1> Well, I can certainly see why. And now the most important question of all: what color do you prefer? <0> I like red because it's scientifically proven to have a very slight stimulant effect. <1> Why yes it is! And great choice. Do you like to attend or watch F1 races as a Ferrari supporter? <0> Yes, my favorite is Kimi Räikkönen, one of the fastest racers today. <1> I have to admit, I'm not familiar! Though I live in the one US city where F1 races are held -- Circuit of the Americas here in Austin. <0> Cool! It has only been there since 2012 and has moved around a lot. I wonder why? <1> I'm not sure....fan base? The ability to economically sustain it? I do know loads of people travel to attend in October.

Maybe i did it wrong? <1> It is not easy for sure. <0> I've read a lot about taking supplements to keep levels in check. Do you do any of that? <1> No, I don't take any supplements but try to be mindful of the nutrients in what I eat. <0> That makes sense. Do you have any advice? <1> It takes commitment and patients to experiment with foods that work for you. <0> I have patient and committed to eating the right food.

<0> so are you a smoker ? <1> no i am not . are you ? <0> Only occasionally, such as on my birthday, New Year's, or when taking a long drive that lasts several hours. <1> I understand.  I stay away from it completely since I love the hiking so much.   <0> I should stop also, before I develop health conditions like my dad did. I love hiking also! It is one of my favorite things to do with my friends. <1> Hiking is good for your soul too.  You get to enjoy nature.
<0> I can't wait until this weekend <1> why is that? <0> I get to spend the weekend with my daughter, she loves shopping so I'm gonna spoil her silly! <1> That sounds like a great way to spend the weekend. I spent last weekend shopping. <0> Yeah? What kind of stuff did you buy? <1> I didn't buy much but did find some new clothes to wear to work. Are you looking to buy anything in particular this weekend? <0> That's good, as my wife says, you can never have enough clothes! But nothing too expensive hopefully, have to save for Christmas. <1> I can't believe Christmas is almost here. I don't start to think about it until after Thanksgiving. <0> I think about it all year round I really like Christmas time, especially when it snows. <1> It doesn't snow around where I live so it's hard to get in the Christmas mood with warmer weather
<0> me too , but mostly i play jazz , usually bass . what did you make ? <1> i made a jewelry box as a gift for my sisters birthday next month . she will be 35 . <0> Wow, I am also going to turn 35 this year! <1> Happy birthday!  Are you doing anything fun for your birthday? <0> I will turn 35 in two months, but i think im going to take out the grill and cook some stakes! <1> That sounds like a nice relaxing birthday.  Did anything big happen in year 34? <0> not really, just did a lot of fishing, caught a mean 6 pound bass!
<0> Do you like pasta? It's a food of tradition Italian cruise. I love it <1> Pasta  is one of my favorites. I'd eat it the day before a game for the carbs.  <0> Carbs scare me but I love pasta. Or Italian cuisine's, they are a food typically from Italy, I'd love to go there! <1> Italy is beautiful. I have been to Asisi, Florence, and Rome. Their gelato does not disappoint.  <0> I heard it's huge! 61 million inhabitants. It's a dream to go there. So one day I will. You're lucky! <1> It is huge for such a small place. The culture is amazing as well. Everyone is so lively.  <0> Speaking of small places, there is a work creation nonfiction that was published 1988 called Small Place. Maybe a book? Do you like to read books? <1> Yes but I can't find time to read any recently!
<0> Childcare is actualy considered a skill and it covers a broad topic of prof., institutions, activities and conventions. <1> I can see that being a skill. You have to know a lot of different topics. <0> Yes, child care providers are our childrens first teacher, if you think about it..besides us as the paremts. <1> I agree. Plus you have to be so careful about who your child care provider will be. It's not cheap either. <0> In north carolina you have to be licensed by the state to watch two or more kids unrelated to you for more then 4 hours a day. <1> That makes sense. I'm sure all other states are regulated in the same way.

You're also helping to improve her health with those biscuits! They help clean her teeth! <0> yea, that is the main reason i feed them to her, for her teeth <1> Does she like the flat, bone-shaped ones? Those are my dog's favorite! <0> the shape does not really matter to her, just the size, she has a small mouth

<0> There are so many outdoor sports that involve water. <1> Yes I enjoy water skiing myself. It is hard to learn but once you get the hang of it it is very fun. <0> I love water skiing also, but it has been a long time since I have skied. There are dozens of sports that include water. <1> Another great water sport is marco polo. My kids love to play it every time they go swimming. <0> That is such a fun game. Water skiing has over 900 competitions every year and 11 million skiers. <1> Yeah I have seen some of the tricks they do. It's crazy how good they are with the flips. <0> Yes, it requires a lot of upper body strength and balance. You must have strong muscles also. <1> I bet. Those guys and girls are ripped. It's a pretty physically demanding sport. <0> Yes, they are responsible for proper movements and not injuring their organs, such as the heart. <1> It definitely takes a lot of athleticism to water ski.
<0> I went home for the summer and my mum cooked for me every day. <1> Oh! That's so nice isn't it? where were you coming home from? <0> Texas. Where are you from?  <1> Alabama, I have lived here my whole life. I have family in Texas and stayed there for a summer many years ago. <0> You know how hot summers are here then. Im just glad its getting close to Christmas. I love it! <1> Yes! Even hotter than here and Florida. I prefer cold weather, would love to move more north in the future. <0> My daughter loves the hot weather. Is it humid in Alabama? <1> Very humid. I loved going to Mount Rushmore and seeing how it was 97 but I barely broke a sweat. Dry heat was great. <0> I agree. Dry heat is much better than humidity. Not too humid in my part of the state though <1> That's good. The heat outside makes me glad that I work mostly from home lol. <0> Me too! I love a fire in my fireplace while I work. Cant beat it! <1> That makes me imagine a fire crackling. Very relaxing. Now I feel cozy and ready for bed. Where is the hot cocoa? <0> I usually don't have hot cocoa when I work, it makes me too jittery. 
<0> I really enjoy baking.  I actually used to work in a bakery when I was in college <1> I love baking but I'm just a beginner.  What do you like to bake? <0> I really like baking croissants.  They are layered with butter, rolled, and placed on a sheet. <1> That sounds kind of difficult.  What about Macaroons? <0> They are good as well.  You can make with with ground almonds, coconut, and sometimes other nuts <1> What is a good pastry to bake as a beginner? <0> I would say the most common ones such as pies or tarts.  They are good for newbies <1> I love pies! That would be a good project to try. Are cookies easy? <0> Cookies have such a wide variety that the skill level varies as well.
<0> i saw a guy lift a car,  he was so strong <1> Wow. He must be really strong! Why'd he lift the car? <0> it was a strong man contest.  he wasn't that big either,  just really strong. <1> Oh I've heard of those contests. Must be exciting to see. <0> Yeah, it was really exciting. I've been to plenty.
<0> My boyfriend went crazy. He stole my rent money <1> I hope you called the cops on him. <0> I did but they said they couldn't do anything because his name is on the lease!  <1> Maybe you should leave him and move away, possibly seattle im from here.  <0> But my kids go to school here. <1> Ah that is hard. It is very nice here just rains a bunch.  <0> I have never been. It's on my list of places to visit <1> You really should and if you ever need work I can help.  <0> What a generous offer.  Have you ever visited the east coast? <1> I work in public relations, I havent but its on my bucket list. <0> The east coast is a great place to be.
<0> I'm sick of my purple hair, but I'm not sure if changing it would be too damaging to my hair <1> Are you wanting it to cover gray hair or as a fashionable statement? <0> both! I am getting some gray hair <1> You should do the granny hair.  It is a new trend where young women are dying their hair different shades of gray. <0> Sounds interesting, can I do it at home or do I need a salon <1> You can do it at home or it can be done professionally. 
<0> I helped my neighbor mow her lawn. I barely have the energy to mow my own. <1> That was very nice of you though <0> Yea I am trying to help her everytime I can also it help me collect enough money for my goal. <1> That's cool, what are you trying to collect money for? <0> buying huge macaroni bag at costco to make macaroni art.  <1> Oh wow! I love macaroni, but usually with cheese:) I would probably eat my art. <0> ahah yea thats the hard part about this hobby. Not eating your project.. <1> Well, if you did eat it, I wouldn't judge you! What type of art do you create with the macaroni? <0> Contemporary art, its hard to explain. I paint each macaroni individually and make things like bridge and dog <1> I can dig that! I saw a piece of art yesterday that was made out of individually splash painted toy soldiers! Who can judge art. <0>  Yes,i will keep helping her to make more money to buy macaroni.

<0> i envy my friend who is off work today <1> I bet.  It is nice to have a day off every now and then
<0> Manta Rays are large rays <1> I never believed how big they were until I saw them in a documentary. They're huge! <0> They have triangular pectoral fins. Scary <1> Not scary, I think that's just what gives them their wide diamond shape. I heard they have a giant migration pattern. <0> They eat a large amount of zooplankton as they swim <1> Are they the ones that sniff out larger prey under the sand with electrical current or are those a different ray?
<0> hi want to be my friend <1> sure , what kinds of things do you enjoy ? <0> well not math . that is my worst class . maybe music . that is cool <1> my daughter is a math genius , i don't like it either . you married ? <0> not yet . i just turned 13 ! <1> oh , what is your favorite movie ? <0> i like the iron man movies . have you seen those ? <1> No, i'm too busy working as a professional mathematician.

<0> Ireally love the color red, In fact the color red is the colour at the end of the visible spectrum of light, next to the color orange and opposite of violet. <1> Hey, red is actually my favorite color! You know I find that red is very influential in a lot of ways. Have you heard of color psychology? <0> Yes and I hear that Colors can also enhance the effectiveness of placebos. <1> So if a pill is red, I can expect that I'll *think* it will work better than a pill that isn't red? <0> Yes that is another way to put it, There was actually a test with this theory, heterosexual men tended to report that red outfits enhance a females attractiveness, while heterosexual females denied any outfit color impacting that of men. <1> Well I certainly know that when women wear red it enhances their attractiveness in my eyes, lol. Doesn't matter what skin color, red clothes just do it for me!
<0> hello ! how is your day going ? <1> good . my job rocks . i pump gas ! <0> nice ! what do you do after work ? i like dancing . <1> i watch movies . but not it . clowns terrify me <0> sorry to hear . i used to live in fear before i came to the united states . <1> if you are afraid of something bury it in the garden <0> wish i could . born and bred in somalia , where i was forced to marry as a kid . <1> That sounds awful, I'm sorry - when did you manage to leave Somalia?
<0> That is interesting.  What turned you to eating vegan? I love a good melt in your mouth steak. <1> I just wanted to be healthier, so I started with veganism which is the practice of abstaining from animal products. <0> Well, actually my husband wanted me to eat healthier, even though I think steak is healthy. <1> We eat steak at least once a week, but I know it isn't necessarily healthy. <0> It is filled with protein, so I believe it is good for you if you eat it once a week.  <1> Yes, but I know a vegetarian diet is so much better, the problem I would have is I don't like vegetables. <0> I love vegetables, they are great in salads or eaten as a side dish.  <1> I like salads, which is probably the only vegetables I really like.  But, I think the protein from meat is important too. <0> Yes, protein is very important for your health, and for building lean body mass.  <1> I live in the south where everything is fried!  At least I do grill almost all the meat I eat, including the steak.   <0> Fried food is not good for you. Grilling is a good way to go when cooking meat. Beans and yogurt are also a good source of protein. <1> Yogurt is okay, but I don't think I could eat enough beans to make up for the loss of proteins.  Have a good day!
<0> Uhmnn,I see ! So what's the origin? <1> Trance emerged during the early 1990s in Germany as a more melodic offshoot from techno. <0> Really, i am not heared about it <1> It's a really niche topic since it has recently gained a lot of negative reputation from its fanbase. <0> ok , can you elaborate more about techno ?
<0> Is it true Wine tasting is a delicate art? <1> You could say so, however, results have surfaced that definitely tend to contradict the reliability of wine tasting.  Blind testing has identified many inconsistencies. <0> What do you mean by reliability? <1> Well there used to be a recognized system that people thought was concrete surrounding wine testing.  But recently scientists have been exploring the objective parameters of the human olfactory system. <0> How exactly is wine tasting done? <1> Typically the wine tasters will all sip the wine, then use an ever evolving system of terminology to describe the aromas, flavors, and characteristics of the wine.
<0> sure , where do you want to go ? <1> anywhere ! single and free , look at me ! <0> Hello!  Where are ya'll planning to go? <1> I would like to go Alabama I have not been there for a long time  <0> The beaches in Alabama are wonderful as well as outlet malls. <1> That sounds nice ,I was there when I was young cant remember a lot of it  <0> What city did you visit?  Mobile is a nice town and is not to far from Pensacola in Florida. <1> I think it was Mobile , I know it was really nice where we were, you like to travel? <0> Yes, I love to travel.  New adventures are a great way to learn about culture and history. <1> History is one my favorites as well! <0> Alabama has tons of history both before and after the civil war.  Beautiful gardens, tea houses, and historic districts throughout. <1> that sounds exciting 
<0> I'm not really a fan of the color red. <1> I love red. All the the shades from red crimson to red burgundy are so pretty! <0> I think pink is a really cool color, but regular red just doesn't do it for me.  Maybe it is just too warm. <1> My favorite planet is Mars because it's red. Iron oxide is what gives it red tint. <0> I didn't know that about Mars.
<0> I took my wife surfing for the first time today. within an hour she was riding waves,  Color me impressed! <1> Oh wow,  I think it'd take me much longer to not bust my butt! That is impressive!

Do they help a bit? <0> Oh, yah.  We had some great times.  Lots of laughs.  Like the time I got sicker than a dog while we were in New Mexico. <1> Oh boy - that sounds like quite the memory! Why did you get sick? <0> Well, we stopped for lunch at this roadside place, it was really busy, figured it was safe.  It's why I can't stand the sight of tacos to this day. <1> Ah, say no more - I catch your drift. I'm sure glad that didn't happen to me - I love tacos! <0> So, do you see your parents often? <1> Not as much as I'd like. I'm hoping I can visit over the holidays.
<0> It seems like it would hard to get the supplies and ingredients needed. But I like having a hobby or two. <1> I know. When I do it, I am like I am doing something that has been going on for over 7000 years.  <0> that is true, it is one of the most basic of human activities <1> It is impressive but also time consuming and difficult. <0> I can imagine, sometimes I much prefer just sitting and watching television <1> Yeah, it can seem daunting and TV is excellent for escapism. <0> my favorite is the walking dead, how about you? <1> The walking dead's great, although I'm a bit behind. I'm currently looking for something new to watch. <0> The walking dead is my favorite show
<0> Do uo <1> We are talking about popular music in the 1980s. <0> What is your favorite 1980s music <1> well, the 1980s saw emergence of dance music and new wave. <0> Wow, do you love so many of 1980s music's? <1> Yes, disco became old school  <0> I love a lot of the 80s music as well.
<0> Sometimes i wish i was Superman, the DC Comic book superhero. <1> I am actually more of a Marvel Comic book fan.   <0> Sometimes when i daydream, i wish i was Shazam, the Marvel comic book superhero. <1> What about those superheros interest you? <0> If i was a superhero, I would be able to fight SAVAK, the Iranian intelligence agency once run by Hossein Fardoust. <1> Interesting choice. If I was a superhero, I would like to be the Flash. What superhero movies have you watched? <0> The last film i watched was about operation "TPAJAX", about the coup in 1953 that overthrew democracy in Iran and installed the shah. <1> i am not a fan of Marvel Comic book
<0> Hey, I really love Jazz music, that originates from African-American communities of New Orleans. Do you like it? <1> Yeah jazz music is ok.  Who is your favorite artist?  <0> I don't have anyone specific. But I enjoy the classic sound from the 1920s Jazz Age. It was one of the genres most prominent times. <1> What do you think of Miles Davis?  <0> He's a pretty awesome trumpeter and composer. You like his music?  <1> Yeah he is good.  What was his style of playing known as? 
<0> yeap ! i am super happy that's why ! <1> i am glad your happy . do you salsa dance for a living <0> I am not a professional dancer but I certainly love to do it. I actually work at a company that involves bitcoin projects. <1> That's quite interesting.  I need to learn more about cryptocurrency.  I thought that I had missed the opportunity to get into bitcoin. <0> Yes. it is something that's simple yet complicated to master. What kind of work do you do? <1> I am a nurse at a local hospital. The job gets stressful so I like to surf during my off days. <0> Oh yes surfing is a good way to relax. Where do you usually go to surf? <1> I usually go to Rincon Beach off Santa Barbara. But I'd love to go surfing in Hawaii. Do you surf at all? <0> I tried but I never go the hang of it. Hawaii would be a nice place to go! Maybe you should go this winter. <1> That's a good idea. I could use a vacation somewhere warm! Have you been to Hawaii?
<0> I'm trying for a promotion this coming February. <1> Oh. I hope you get it!  <0> So do I. I want to make more. It would be more challenging as well. What do you do? <1> I work in marketing. It's kinda cut throat sometimes. <0> Yeah i have heard. I wanna make more cheese...LOL and that is actually my favorite type of food. What about you? <1> My favorite foods are pizza and lasagna. Both involve cheese <0> Oh yeah.I love those foods as well. I love to have some wine and cheese after horseback riding. I love to ride horses. <1> I could never get into horse riding. The riding is too bouncy and uncomfortable for me <0> Your not the first person to say that and you won't be the last.
<0> I like the number 7, which comes between 6 and 8. <1> Whats so special about it? <0> Nothing really. The Hindus used to write their 7's like an uppercase J, vertically inverted. <1> The only time I like the number seven is when i'm shooting dice. <0> Interestingly, the Arabs developed the character from a 6 lookalike into an uppercase V lookalike. <1> How has the shape of the number 7 character changed over time? <0> Well, modern Arab forms influenced the European form, a 2 stroke character consisting of a horizontal upper line joined with a line going down the bottom left corner. <1> The number 7 seems to be a very common lucky number for a lot of people.
<0> Skunk <1> The animals are known for their ability to spray a liquid that is used to scare other animals away. <0> I grew up on a farm there was always skunks hanging around trying to get a free meal <1> it is a skunk , i know but he's so darn cute <0> They are cute animals but very smelly <1> I wish my dog would figure that out. I'm tired of cleaning him up. lol
<0> Ferrari is an awesome sports car manufacturer <1> Ferraris are great cars but I think I prefer Lamborghini overall. <0> Same but both are great italian sports cars <1> Oh yeah there's no denying that they're both top tier car manufacturers. <0> yep one day i hope to own a ferrari sports car <1> I think I might prefer to own a Tesla instead but I would love any nice car honestly.
<0> I used to really like Anthony Michael Hall, who starred in several teen films in the 80s <1> His name sounds very familiar, but I can't place him. Can you name some of the movies he's been in? <0> Sure Sixteen Candles and National Lampoons Vacation <1> Sixteen Candles was a great movie! I remember watching that when I was younger and loving it. <0> Then he did The Breakfast Club and Weird Science - my husband really likes that one. <1> The Breakfast Club is a classic! That is one of my favorite movies ever. That is probably where I recognize Anthony Michael Hall's name from. <0> He definitely allowed himself to become typcast as his geek persona during that time. <1> Yeah, he is one of my favorite actors!  Is he one of your favorites?
<0> My mother always enjoyed jazz music. I might try to find a jazz concert to give it a try <1> Jazz is a music genre that originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans it is also my favorite music genre <0> Who are some popular jazz artists? <1> Richard Gordon is an American arranger, composer, songwriter, and classically trained guitarist who has recorded several contemporary jazz music <0> How long has jazz been around? <1> Since the early 1900s at least.
<0> My favourite number is 7! It is a natural number that follows the number 6 and precedes number 8 <1> I hear that's a lucky number but have never been a big believer in luck.  <0> Yes, it is known as a lucky number in western countries! <1> Do you know any interesting facts about the number 7 or numbers in general? <0> Yes I do, the eastern arabs actually developed the character for 7 by using an uppercase V and rotating it <1> I can definitely see that. I would have expected it to be from Greeks though.
<0> We are visiting Niagara Falls for my upcoming honeymoon. <1> Thats great! The falls actually form the southern end of the Niagara Gorge in which I have been too 3 times.  <0> I bet it's a beautiful view. <1> It is I have been to all three waterfalls which are the Horseshoe Falls, the American Falls and the Bridal Veil Falls. You should visit them all.  <0> I didn't know there were different waterfalls. <1> The Horseshoe Falls which is my most favorite is just on the border of the United States and Canada, The falls are separated by Goat Island <0> Very cool. What is on Goat Island? <1> Actually Goat Island has no residents at all, but is a popular place for tourists when visiting the falls on the U.S. side. <0> do they have tours and stuff like that? <1> They do have tours of Goat Island and beautiful views of the Falls on Goat Isand.
<0> I've been there! It's beautiful! What are you hoping to see in the area? <1> While it's been ranked as one of the best beach is the US we plan on going to see Winter the Dolphin and then we will see if we have time for the actual beach <0> That sounds like it would be beautiful! <1> I can't wait, everyone says it is the most magical place on Earth! <0> I believe it. Anything near a beach tends to hold magical properties. Paradise <1> I'm super excited. I'd love to live in a beach house. Have you ever been to Clearwater Beach before? <0> I have actually. Out in Florida?  <1> ok that is cool
<0> I just love baking, I love to bake item like bread and pastries but I make lots of other types of foods as well.  <1> me too! I love baking and cooking in general. baking and decorating cakes is my favorite <0> Me too, I just love to form it into cool shapes and top it with sweet icing for dessert.  <1> i even used fondant. it doesn't taste good but the cake looks so beautiful <0> Ah yes fondant is so simple, i make it with sugar and water stabilized with gelatin and a pinch of glycerine. Its an old recipe indeed.  <1> i actually made a marshmallow fondant, it tastes a little better than the original one <0> In french  in French it means "melting", Maybe they were thinking of marshmallows when the got the name haha.  <1> I'm planning to make a bread loaf with giant marshmallow eyes.
<0> I do love orange juice but its not as good for you as a person would hope <1> I didn't know that pulp is the juice vesicle for the orange juice.  How isn't it good for you? <0> Primarily the added sugars. The best OJ is the one made at home <1> i agree. i love juicing at home... then I eat the rest of the fruit lol <0> I like eating the rest of the fruit or trying to get the most of the fruit. <1> yes my diet is mainly pescatarian <0> What is pescatarian, never heard of it. <1> everything but meat. fruits veggies fish ...no steak lol <0> So a vegetarion+Fish, interesting. Do you like it? <1> Yes, I think it is very good for your health!
<0> plus i am beyond ready to move out <1> i see are you going to college <0> Yep, Go LSU!  <1> sweet, what subject are you taking? <0> Undecided, I just want to make a bunch of money  <1> money is the goal that everyone dreams of <0> Money, Hoes, and Clothes, all a brother knows <1> lol, do you like playboi carti? <0> who (I'm old) <1> the greatest muscian ever to have lived, playboi carti <0> I don't know, I guess I'm too young
<0> i felt happy this morning because it was sunny and warm <1> That's always a great start to a day.
<0> Yesterday i went to the gym and i forgot to bring my towel. i went to shower and had to go back to my locker naked. so embarassing <1> Lol that is so funny how did you do that was anyone around? <0> I love running, so I actually ran to my locker. There were a few new people there lol. <1> I get it. I have taken my share of gym showers after football practice. We all just know not to look down. <0> Yes! I need to shower because I am so sticky and nasty!
<0> I'm trying to get some work done and my dog just wants to play!  I love him to death but he needs to learn to be independent at times too! <1> Pets are great,  but they can be a bit needy for attention at times. It is great,  but not when you are busy and trying to get things done. <0> Thats very true.  After our first conversation I might have to take a break and play with him a bit.  I might have to log off and go on a sort walk to tire him out. <1> A walk will definitely help. He will probably be ready for a nap when you get back,  then you can get some work done.
<0> i have a presentation due this week,  I am not looking forward to presenting it in front of others <1> It can be nerve wrecking. I'm sure you will do fine,  though! Have confidence!
<0> I was scared to fly for the first time <1> Why's that? <0> Because I am scared of heights. <1> Have you always been scared of heights? <0> I hate heights
<0> My husband and I have been watching TV together each night--once the baby is asleep,  of course. <1> That sounds like some nice relaxing quality time <0> It really is! it's the only time in the day that we're guaranteed to have some time together,  just us.  <1> Have you ever passed out together watching tv? <0> Not yet - but I'm sure it'll happen at some point! <1> Aww, maybe you'll do something else then? :)
<0> I have a performance review and potential promotion coming up in the next few weeks. <1> that's awesome! I hope you will get a promotion. what do you do for work? <0> I work as an accountant for a carpet cleaning company. There is a chance that I could be made a manager! <1> You will be a great manager!

<0> Financially,  things will turn around for my family soon! <1> I hope and wish so. In this tough economic climate many are finding it difficult to cope with financial responsibilities <0> Yes,  and we had a layoff of five months.  I believe in a brighter day,  though,  so I know it will improve. <1> Being optimistic will help you alleviate much of your accumulated stress <0> I know, but I just don't see things improving for me.

<0> I'm a huge fan of Jazz! It's an awesome music genre with cool African-American roots which is what I love about it! <1> Jazz is fantastic, although it seems to have fallen from popularity since the 50's, where rock and roll took over. <0> Yeaha and in the late 19th and early 20th centuries it developed into blues and ragtime too. <1> Modern Jazz appears to be more inspired by those evolutions than the original Jazz that was prevalent in the 1920's <0> Yeah it seems like it. I like how all the musical styles it's connected to lead to African-American and European-American. Another awesome thing is it's evolved into performance as well! <1> A Personal favorite genre of mine is where jazz instruments were introduced back into Rock and Roll and became Ska. <0> That's nice too! Originally it was characterized by swing and blue notes for example, response vocals and polyrhythms but of course all that evolved with time too. <1> It seems like Jazz is the bedrock for most modern American Music, with Bluegrass making up the rest. <0> Yeah even though music in the US is so multi-ethnic. It was influenced by West African, Irish, Scottish and of course European among many others. <1> You're right, music has been influenced over the year.
<0> I was surprised my brother signed up for the army. <1> Oh , really, that's so brave of him <0> Yeah,  it might have just been an ROTC thing,  but he did some traveling. <1> Ok, where did he travel to?
<0> It's a beautiful day here today. The sun is shining. The birds are singing. The roads are quiet. <1> wow sounds great <0> Yeah it really it. It's chilly but that's how it should be on Halloween <1> Exactly! Halloween should be cold and spooky, <0> I hope we get a lot of trick or treaters. I never got to be the actress I wanted to be so I use that energy to spook the kids. <1> Do you live somewhere with lots of trick-or-treaters? It sounds like fun. <0> I live in a pretty busy, small city so we get a decent amount. How about you? <1> I live in a small town also. We have a huge skateboard park that is putting on a Halloween bash!
<0> Target always felt like the slightly classier walmart. <1> They have certainly always seemed to have a better reputation, considering all the protest from small-town advocates, labor unions, and the like. <0> I like the feel of target but there isnt much special about it i feel. <1> In my personal experience, they seem to keep cleaner stores, but have less variety overall and slightly higher prices. <0> exactly, thats a perfect description, not much to look at but a nice store and high prices. <1> It would be nice for there to be some kind of cross between Target and Walmart. Lower prices, and cleaner store with variety - and a company that cared about its employees. But I doubt that will happen.
<0> A friend of mine was sick <1> What were they sick from?
<0> hi ! ! i love animals . my eyes are blue , my dad died when i was 2 . <1> oh no , my father is alive and used to work for ge . <0> That’s nice. I was too young to remember anything, but my mom tells me stories about him all the time. <1> That's great that you're able to at least hear stories! I noticed you mentioning your love for animals.. What's your favorite? <0> Hmmm... I’d have to say giraffes. What’s yours? <1> That's a hard one. I'd say large cats like Lynx but any dogs come close second. <0> Lynx’s are neat animals. You said that dogs come close... do you own a dog? <1> I do yes! I have an Akita and Husky. Do you have any pets? <0> Yes. I have a dog as well. She’s a mix between a pug and beagle. She’s super sweet and rarely barks. Do you have any other pets besides Akita? <1> I love pugs. They are so loving. Aside from the Akita just the Husky I mentioned. She talks all the time and doesn't really know when to shut up haha. <0> They really are!! What is your favorite thing to do with your dogs?
<0> There is a real issue with obesity in the US.  Right? <1> Yes, obesity in the United States has been increasingly cited as a major health issue. <0> What kind of health issues are there associated with obesity? <1> Well, obesity causes diseases like coronary heart diseases, which can lead to mortality. <0> Wow, that is definitely not good.  What is the best thing someone can do to fight obesity? <1> Well on a personal level there is diet in exercise, but you could also support organizations like The Biggest Loser <0> Interesting.  I find it sort of sad that people seem to embrace this condition and almost feel proud to be obese.  I wonder why this occurs? <1> Its just become the norm in society. We need to change how we treat it.
<0> good evening . what are you up to ? <1> hello , how are you ? i am well . i like to shop for shoes and watches . <0> i don't shop much . prefer to relax at home with my cow . <1> what do you do ? i'm work for a watch dealer . <0> I own a farm and will sell at the farmers market.

But I'm shy. Do you dance? <0> No, I'm too shy. How about you?

Is he a dalmation?  <0> actually no he's a lab  <1> Labs make great companions! How did he get his name? <0> I gave him the name spots because he is covered in spots  <1> Oh, wow. I've never seen a lab covered in spots. 
<0> Have you been to San Diego Comic-Con?! It's such a big part of popular culture, and has grown so much since it's early days as the Golden State Comic Book Convention in 1970! <1> I haven't cosplay culture has always been on the fringe of my social circles though, I see a ton of it on Reddit. <0> There are some *amazing* cosplay creations and creators! Do you have a favorite? A specific character or costume? <1> I personally love Geralt from the Witcher series, anyone who can resemble him is some kinda cool guy <0> I must admit I'm unfamiliar -- I only know that the Witcher Saga is huge -- isn't it a series or about to be?! <1> It is going to be on Netflix soon yes! <0> Do you know who is cast? I think that's why/how I heard about it -- and the fact Netflix and I are friends! Crazy it's inspired films, series, video games, etc....oh, and cosplayers!  <1> I'm not sure actually, it must be nice being such good friends with Netflix haha. Cosplayers are like furries that don't get weird with it.
<0> I don't have a job currently. So today, I robbed an old lady. I feel bad about it. <1> Wow, that's really extreme. You should feel bad about it. <0> I know but I was desperate. <1> I mean, I get desperate times, but is there not a church or something in your area you could have turned to for help? <0> Well, I did. they told me that they won't pay me to travel to Nashville. <1> Why do you need to travel to Nashville? <0> One of my dreams is to become a country music star. <1> That's cool. How much did you steal from the old lady? Enough to buy a bus ticket?
<0> Another one of my friends got engaged <1> You are saying it as if it's a bad thing, are you left without friends? <0> No, there just two people in my group of friends who has not gotten married, me and my friend Karla <1> Well you're the smart one, make sure you wait for the right person before you get married! <0> I actually dream about having a big family. I drive a large car, a van, and I think that would be the perfect car for my family <1> Huh, the car before the family, isn't there a saying similar to that? LOL Just kidding <0> Not at all! I grew up in a large family. I remembered seeing grandma with her beautiful curly hair taking care of seven children at the same tiem <1> Wow, i only have one and she is exhausting.  <0> So, who old is your kid? <1> She is almost 1. <0> wow! that's such cute age! Does you daughter have red hair like you do? <1> No she has red hair like her dad! 
<0> Have you ever been to the stand-up comedy venue in Times Square New York called Carolines on Broadway? Its so much fun <1> I haven't! I've never been to New York. What is so awesome about that venue? <0> It's one of the most established, famous and recognized comedy clubs in the US. Lots of laughs there <1> Have you seen any great comedians there? I love stand-up comedy! <0> Some of the greatest. My favorite was Patrice O'Neal (RIP), but others I've seen were Larry David, Greg Giraldo, Dave Attell and Rich Vos
<0> i was upset sitting in traffic yesterday <1> Was it long?
<0> Really? I lived in something similar to section 8 public housing at one point. How does section 8 work? <1> well its considered social housing now .. its an umbrella term referring to rental housing which may be owned and managed by the state, by non-profit organizations, or by a combination of the two <0> I live in a luxury loft now thought. Made a bunch of money selling beanie babies  <1> That is really sweet, I saw someone tweet diy's on how to make those. A loft that is fancy I live in a apartment downtown.  <0> I can't garden in my loft though, and I really like to garden. <1> Oh wow really ? what would you grow if you could garden vegetables, fruits or flowers? <0> Probably herbs, vegetables, and pot. <1> i like simple stuff , but i support whatever you want to do . i would rather garden. What's your favorite desserts? <0> I'm a fan of cheesecake. Do you own a Chevrolet? <1> I love cheesecake but don't know how to make one so I use the no bake jello one lol. It works since I love jello. <0> I have never heard of that. How do the no bake jello ones taste?
<0> I finished college this summer and now I'm on to a new job in nursing I am nervous.  <1> Congrats to you!  What kind of nurse are you looking to be? <0> I will be a RN I think I am over thinking the new role but I am self assured I will do great this is my passion. <1> I have no doubt that you will be a great RN! <0> Thanks, it's a lot of hard work, though.
<0> Uhmnn,I see ! So what's the origin? <1> Trance emerged during the early 1990s in Germany as a more melodic offshoot from techno. <0> Really, i am not heared about it <1> It's a really niche topic since it has recently gained a lot of negative reputation from its fanbase. <0> Hmm, that's interesting.
<0> Everyday i buy my dog because because it is hard and dry <1> You buy your dog? What do you buy your dog? <0> I buy my dog, dog biscuit. It is often sold in a flat bone-shape. <1> Dog biscuits are probably pretty good for them. Does your dog like them? <0> Yes he does and it is a dietary supplement for dogs or other canines, similar to human snack food. <1> That's good to hear. Do you ever feed him real meat? <0> Yes i do especially when the dog biscuit was criticized as particularly bad bread <1> Glad you are keeping up with the latest health buzz. A healthy dog is a must. <0> Yes of course. My dog health issue is a concern for me because Infectious diseases that affect dogs are important not only from a veterinary standpoint, but also because of the risk to public health <1> That's true. The health of our pets is interconnected with our own health.

What position do you play? My son's team is playing Greenwich at the coast, it'll give me time to go to the shore!  <1> Are we talking about the same kind of football? I am from the united states and I know that what we call football is different than other countries. <0> Oh yes! My son thinks he'll be the next Tom Brady! I follow his wife Giselle on Insta, she collects Seashells like me, so we can connect over that! Teenagers! <1> Is your son planning to play football in college? <0> Yes, he hopes! He is 6'5" and has a nice spin on his pass! <1> Best of luck to him, maybe he'll end up playing for a great school like Alabama! Roll tide!
<0> I love the Italian car maker called Ferrari. They make some of the most iconic supercars in the world! What car brands do you like? <1> I like to watch races . I know the Ferrari is a race car and is in the Formula One races. But no one in particular. <0> Ferrari has multiple cars... They have F1 race cars, supercars, and hyper cars. They are a brand. What races do you watch from Ferrari? <1> Yeah, I know. I like their road cars . The racing cars are just for racing I thought. Like the Formula one races <0> Yup, though you referred "the Ferrari" is solely race cars for Formula One that is the highest class of single seating auto racing. <1> I do not like road cars

<0> I know it's kind of weird...but I like to take cold showers :) <1> You need to take advantage of the indoor structure of showers so I say do what you want! <0> Once you get used to them, they are actually quite nice for waking you up. A bit..shocking I dare sya <1> I agree! You know there are early signs of Egyptians having indoor shower rooms where servants would bathe them? <0> I did not know that, but I'm not surprised. I'm not sure when the first person got that bright idea, but it was probably far, far back <1> Well actually it just started with someone pouring a jug of water, which was often very cold. You would have liked that! <0> Hah, probably! Anything else interesting you know? <1> There are these types of puzzles called water pouring puzzles.  <0> Oh? What are those? <1> I do not know
<0> My new car was extremely damaged in a road accident last week being my very first car, i;m shuttered <1> I'm so sorry. : ( 
<0> i wish i did i have kids though <1> i used to have 6 kats but don't hav them no mor <0> I started selling clothes on facebook to make money on the side <1> Wow, thats a great side buisness. I used to make toys for the 6 cats i used to own and I sold extras online! <0> that's fantastic to hear, my husband the pastor loves to shop online. <1> Your husband is a pastor? I would appreciate it if he could pray for me...I had a headache so bad that I had to call 911 <0> we will but in the mean time browser my store on facebook so we can be both saved. <1> Definitely! we can help eachother. <0> praise Jesus and pass the ammunition!!!
<0> I used to work outside of the home. It was difficult finding reliable child care. <1> Do you have children? Child care is an action or skill looking after children by a day care center, nannies or baby sitters. <0> I do have children. Two boys. How about you? <1> I don't but it is important to understand now. Early child care is equally important and often overlooked in child development. <0> Yes, it's definitely better to have young children in a place that will aid in their social and intellectual development. <1> That's so true. And daycare is typically an ongoing service during specific time periods like when you need to work.
<0> I love Snoop Dogg, do you know much about him? <1> Yes, I know Snoop. His real name is Calvin Broadus, Jr. He was born in 1971 and is a rapper, singer, and songwriter. <0> I didn't know that was his real name haha, sounds interesting. Do you ever listen to his music? <1> I did when I was younger. Snoop was discovered by Dr. Dre in 1992 and was featured on Dre's "Deep Cover" and "The Chronic" albums. <0> Yeah Drre helped him out a lot. I like his song Gin and Juice, do you know it? <1> Yeah, I do. Dre's real name is Andre Young. He was born in 1965 and is a rapper and record producer. <0> Yeah Dre's one of the biggest names in the game. Do you listen to rap a lot or just when you were younger? <1> Mostly when I was younger but I do still like to listen to Eminem, also known as Marshall Mathers, born in 1972. <0> Eminem is a rap legend
<0> Do you have a favorite cheese? I am a fan of Gouda cheese myself. <1> I prefer American cheese but Gouda is also nice, it is made from cow's milk! <0> I wonder how it got the name gouda. Maybe because it tastes good lol. <1> Actually the cheese originates from Gouda, Netherlands, so thats how it got its name! But I agree, it does taste goud! <0> I did not know it was Dutch. Is that where they make Gouda cheese? In the Netherlands? <1> I think Gouda cheese can be anywhere, it is only named after the city where it was historically traded <0> Do you know when it originated? Was it recent or has Gouda been around for a long time? <1> Actually, the first mention of Gouda cheese has been observed to be as far back as 1184! So it is one of the oldest recorded cheese ever made! <0> I know where it originated from.

That is going to be a great time. <0> It is! I'm really excited for it! It's tonight,  so it was also a big surprise!  <1> Wow. I am sure you will remember this for a long time. You are going to have to think of a great surprise for him now. <0> Those were my exact thoughts,I am in the process of deciding what to do for him in return.
<0> Red is such a passionate, vibrant color <1> It really is!  My kitchen is actually red - it's at the end of the visible spectrum of light next to orange and opposite violet. <0> It has the longest wavelength from what I can remember! <1> It does - you are smart!  The wavelength is 625-740 nanometres! <0> That's long, I guess! I know that violet has short wavelengths. <1> Yep - approximately 380-450 nanometers.  Red has so many variations also, from yellow tinged to bluish-red to red pink and even burgunday. <0> Hair coloring <1> I think red hair is the prettiest hair shade ever honestly. And red is even used in ceremonies for Ancient Egyptians and Mayans <0> Red <1> Yes, even Roman generals even colored their bodies in red to celebrate victories!

<0> I accidentally yelled at an elderly person becuase I thought they were being mean to me when they were trying to help me while I was driving.  <1> oh what were they doing to you <0> they were honking at me and flashing their brights, wasnt till i pulled over a noticed a tail light out <1> ohhhh okay that makes more sense. It's hard to communicate between drivers without misunderstandings.  <0> this is true if only there was a way to better communicate on the road <1> Maybe someone will invent some gadget one day to help! Were you going anywhere fun when you were honked at?
<0> I love fast cars which is why I bought a Ferrari. <1> Yeah Ferrari is my favorite sports car manufacturer in Maranello <0> I wonder how much the very first Ferrari cost to buy. <1> I'm not sure, but I do know that Enzo Ferrari wasn't initially interested in producing road cars back when he formed Scuderia Ferraria in 1929 <0> I didn't know that, do you know when they made the first model? <1> I know that Ferrari didn't start producing sports cars until 1947, 18 years after the Scuderia Ferrari racing team was formed!
<0> My dog had cancer and the vet advised us to put our dog to sleep today. <1> Damn why'd you have to tell me that...Gawd that's freakin sad,  jeezus
<0> I really like going out to eat, but it might be bad for my health <1> Well, I think that all depends on where you're eating and how much you eat. Do you think you're eating anywhere unhealthy? <0> Probably, fast food is just bad for you in general. <1> Yes that's true. You probably want to check out this organic diner across town. I heard that Kid Rock was last seen there. He is a delight. <0> Are they expensive? <1> No that expensive. It's slightly more than your usual chain restaurants but it's worth it. Are you tight on budget? <0> Yeah, I know the best way to save money is to buy groceries, but Im not a great cook. <1> Ah, well don't worry. Everyone starts somewhere. You can learn from online tutorials. This purple diner channel is a great start.
<0> I love going to the bakery and seeing the baker cook stuff. Do you know any cool stuff about bakers?  <1> Grains have been a staple food for millennia, baking is a very old one!  <0> Thats neat, I bet that baking has a very long heritage, Did people in the stone age know how to bake food?  <1> I don't think they did, but by the 5th and 6th centuries the ancient Greeks were using ovens. Most communities had one large shared oven. <0> wow the greeks had ovens? thats really cool. What kind of ovens did they use? Was it coal or fire?  <1> These enclosed ovens were heated by wood fires that were mainly for different types of bread.

He had several movies for entertainment and advertising done with the gang. <0> Is that the one with with the yellow sponge guy? <1> No with Charlie Brown and Snoopy <0> Was snoopy a spie? <1> Not that I know of. <0> Oh...I must be thinking of something else.  Do you play an instrument? <1> no, do you? <0> Yes, a kazoo! I also have mad skills with the tambourine.
<0> Pasta is so versatile and delicious! <1> pasta isa staple italian food <0> Oh I know, like spaghetti and linguine! <1> yep pasta ia a great italian food, i love all pasta <0> I think it goes best with tomato sauce most of the time. <1> pasta is so old,  the first reference dating to 1154 in Sicily. <0> Wow that's such a long time ago! <1> Yea pasta is an italian staple becasue its been around so long so it makes sense <0> I never knew that it was made in Italy first, honestly. <1> I don't know that much about pasta.
<0> My favorite color is red! I think it is bright and cheerful. Do you know anything about the color red? <1> Red is the colour at the end of the visible spectrum of light <0> That's really cool.

I want to be a veterinarian when I grow up. <1> that will be cool , are you looking at any schools to go to ? <0> I have my eyes on a few but I have to discuss it with my parents <1> It is pretty expensive to go to get this type of schooling and it takes a while , but I feel you will enjoy it .  <0> I hope so. What do you do for work? <1> I am a artist and I farm I have cattle ,pigs, a few horse.It is nice <0> That seems like a good life to live to be self sufficient  <1> Yes it is but it is hard work, there is a lot to be done feeding wise, but artist wise I love it , <0> I am envious of you, I hope to have a life like that some day <1> You will when you are a little older
<0> I was thinking about when we finally got to go pick up Rodimus after all that waiting!  I've never been so excited in my life.   <1> what is that? <0> It's our Rotty pup! Sorry haha <1> oh that explains it! <0> Yeah he's very cute.

<0> the number 7 is a great number. <1> Absolutely, it follows 6 and precedes 8! What fun! <0> yea i love 17 as a number the most but both are good <1> 1 and 7 are very similar, it's important to distinguish the upward stroke of the 7 glyph from the long upward stroke in the glyph for 1 <0> yea those two can get confusing <1> Yep. That might also be why sometimes people use a horizontal line through the middle of a 7 in handwriting.
<0> I've got light brown hair, and my wife has naturally slightly darker brown.  I wonder if people tend to pair with people with the same hair color. <1> I'm not so sure about that. I have brown hair, but hubby has black hair.  <0> I guess it's a silly thought, but sometimes I have them :P  Fun fact, your husband has more hair follicles because of their black hair? <1> Really? I didn't know that. I guess that explains why his hair is much thicker then mine.  <0> Yeah, it would be that.  It's probably one of his defining characteristics :P
<0> hello . can you move objects with your mind ? <1> hi how are you doing ? i am okay no i wish i could . <0> i'm great . i had heart surgery and woke up with weird superpowers . <1> i'm so sorry to hear that i believe your powers are from the lord . <0> i do not know . my heart was outside of my body now it is in . <1> i tend to watch large amounts of t . v . on free times . <0> i love the walking dead . are you a fan ? <1> yes i am a fan and love zombie and vampire movies too <0> i like captain america and star wars . <1> what super powers did you awake with ? <0> moving objects with my mind . <1> ok that's cool and i like going to the gym most days .
<0> Do you enjoy baking items like bread or cookies? <1> yes i actually have a lot of experience in baking especially cakes and brownies <0> Do you have any special techniques to make sure the cakes and brownies heat thoroughly? <1> Instead of putting the oven 350 like the recipe calls for, I lower the temperature to 300-325 and let it bake a little longer instead of blasting it with high heat <0> That's a good tip! I could see that applying for other batters and pizza dough to make sure the crust is crispy and still is soft in the center. <1> As long as you keep your eye on the oven at all times its easier to gradually adjust the baking temperature as needed  <0> Baking is such an important skill for cooking, especially since bread is a common and nutritious food for many cultures.
<0> ohh, that's what it is. that sounds like fun. how can you grill on the back of your car?! <1> Its where you bring a portable grill and lay it on your tailgate, usually on a truck, But most people I know do it even if their vehicles dont have tailgates. <0> now people who throw tailgate parties are fanatics about football. who is your favorite football team? <1> I like the Eagles. What about you? <0> sad to say, i am not into sports. but if i was into sports, my college team would be bama and my pro team would be the cowboys <1> so you've never been tailgating then? <0> no ... i am one of those homebodies who gets a thrill out of netflix, a cup of hot peppermint tea and a good book.

The first one was opened in 1962 in Roseville, Minnesota.
<0> As weird as it might sound, sometimes I imagine heaven being a giant bowl of never ending pasta. And I just wade in marinara sauce for eternity, slurping noodles. Weird, yeah? <1> ) is a staple food of traditional Italian cuisine, with the first reference dating to 1154  <0> Well, I can't be the only one who's had this fantasy then. 1154 is a long time ago. Did they make it similar to how it is done in modern times? <1> Fresh pasta was traditionally produced by hand, sometimes with the aid of simple machines <0> Interesting. What is the most popular form of pasta? I would guess spaghetti, but I don't really know. <1> Yeah! Spagetti is a long, thin, solid, cylindrical pasta <0> Well, we both know Italy is famous for pasta. Are there any other countries who make their own version? <1> Significant changes occurred with the discovery of the New World and the introduction of potatoes, tomatoes, bell peppers, maize and sugar beet
<0> i am a big vegan , my favorite meal are tofu burgers though ! you ? <1> i thought about going vegan . i do not eat red meat , so i might give up all meat . <0> You totally should. It's well worth the sacrifice.  <1> I agree. I don't think I could do that. I may be vegetarian for other adopted reasons. <0> What reasons? I just love animals.  <1> It really limits your dietary choices.  I don't recommend it.   Have you considered vegetarian? <0> I started out vegetarian. There are so many options these days, I don't think it limits me. There's an amazing vegan diner next door to my apartment. <1> I see! Did you ever attend any vegetarian festival?

How about you? <0> I have 1 child in that age range and use to have a child around that age but he's 5 now and it also involves nannies, baby sitters, teachers, and day care centers.   It's so hard to find a good one too huh? <1> It really is! We had to put both of my kids (4, 6) into different schools just because they each specialize in something different. Plus, we have had to have help from family members when daycare times are crazy. <0> Early childcare is such an important part of a babies life too and development.  Just finding the right care that you can trust is so crucial <1> Completely agree. We tried one daycare for my youngest and I didn't think they were providing enough education. Even though they were great people, we had to move out. Have you ever had to leave a child supervision facility for a similar reason? <0> Oh yeah at one place we left because he was being abused.   I sometimes just turn to extended family such as my mother, mother and law, sister if I'm lucky.  Sheesh it's just so frustrating. <1> It really is, family is always a good option for daycare.

<0> I used to like to swim - it's very good for your health. I can't swim at the moment so I go to the gym instead. <1> I prefer swimming to weight lifting because it's much more “low-impact”. <0> I'm hoping to start swimming again when it's warmer. <1> Swimming is really fun and besides it, it is very healthy as it involves all muscles of the body to be engaged in movement <0> What other activities do you like to do? <1> I like swimming, yoga, and walking my dog <0> What kind of dog do you have? <1> She's a mixed breed <0> Cute!

I love shopping online, so I have been trying to teach him how to use Amazon Pantry for his groceries but he is resistant to change.  <1> At that age? No surprise. Maybe you could order for him?  <0> I probably could, but he prefers me to go into the store for him.  He is 73, so I doubt he will change.  Do you like shopping online? <1> Old people are often the hardest to get to adopt new things. I do most of my shopping online, yeah <0> True!  I would rather curl up with a good fantasy novel than go into a grocery store! 
<0> I had no roommate my first year of freshman year of college which got quite old <1> ok how did you manage the situation? <0> I just had to deal with. There were a lot of lonely days but I made it. <1> I think I would like some alone time, as long as I could stay busy filming <0> The positive of living alone is that I was able to decorate however. I painted the walls purple, my favorite color. <1> Really, purple is a lovely color. Much better than black, which reminds me of death <0> I know what you mean. That can be quite depressing at times. <1> Maybe I'm too depressed to decorate..that and I hate painting!
<0> i bet . that sounds like a very full life ! <1> it certainly is . i'd rather be writing lol <0> I spend most of my days at the computer writing. Sometimes a little boring. <1> I have 4 kids too so I have very little time too. With my 2 jobs and my husband they take up most of my time <0> Where do you work?  I imagine the kids keep you busy. <1> I work for the state doing Interior Design work.  How about you?
<0> Science Fiction often predicts future inventions, t is an act of creative imagination. <1> Yes, you said that right, a lot of Star Wars, or Star trek inventions became a reality  <0> The difference to fantasy is that it avoids the supernational and often has a foundation in actual science. I love Star Trek as well.  <1> Yes, science fiction can predict the future, but a lot of other shows also, like The Simpsons predicted the Ebola outbreak, have you heard of that? <0> No, tell me more about it. Isn't Ebola this dangerous virus that can cause internal and external bleeding.
<0> Have you ever felt guilty for sleeping all day? <1> Yes! I feel like the day escaped me. Have you done that recently?

<0> I am probably one of the few people in the world that looks forward to winter coming. <1> I am with you,  i like it a lot more than summer personally <0> I can get so much work done indoor and the beauty outside is wonderful. I love winter clothes and all the winter holidays. <1> I feel that,  I hate being hot. In the winter I can be comfy and I can always just put on a jacket if I get too cold,  but in the summer it is not that easy. <0> Yea and its easier to warm up than it is to cool off.
<0> They ran out of my favorite dessert at the restaurant I went to. <1> what did you do? <0> I unfortunately had to choose an alternate which was okay, but not as delicious as the usual. <1> That's always disappointing. You have a certain taste in mind but it's not quite right <0> Well, you know there's nothing like a great warm apple crisp on these cold winter days. <1> Mmmmm,thé glacé as they say in France! <0> Indeed! Hey, you did you see the announcement of when they are taking down the cooling towers at the old power plant? <1> Yes I do.  That was intense.  I hated to see that happen to such an old, established city. <0> I know, time marches on. A lot of old timers were upset, Im eager to see what will be put there. <1> I bet they were. I can't imagine what its like to be a part of all that. <0> It will be tough to get used to at first, but in time they will come to like the change.

Did you know the capital city is the oldest capital in the Americas, and was first built by the Aztecs in 1325. <1> I didn't know that! Do you have any other facts about Mexico? <0> Of course! Mexico is the 11th most populated country in the world with around 117 million people. I'v travelled there quite a bit so picked up some things! <1> What is your favorite food from Mexico? <0> Definitely enchiladas. How about you? <1> I love them...but they give me gas! It's pretty bad.  <0> That isn't Ideal, but my mother makes ones so good it'd be worth it! <1> Enchiladas for the win! Gas never hurts anyone. Sometimes I even use my armpits to make fart noises. I can play the National Anthem with my pits.  <0> That's Impressive! My musical talent expands to playing the triangle, It's harder than it looks to be honest.
<0> When i look at my son doing great in studies,  it makes me so proud! <1> How old is he? <0> He is 13. He has been a straight A student always. <1> Wow,  great job so far,  kep up the great parenting! <0> Thanks very much, what do you think i should do to improve?

<0> My son starts kindergarten next week,  I am a stay at home mom. I want to get caught up on scrapbooking my pictures of him! <1> I bet you're both excited and nervous about it! I have two kids of my own and one will be starting in about a year while the other is going to fourth grade. <0> I had all these plans when I had my son,  they didn't work out but I am wishing that this does!
<0> Baking is such a fun passtime, plus you get baked goods when they're done. <1> Baking is a lot of fun, I really like making bread, it's lots of work but well worth it! <0> Bread is one of my favorite things to bake too! <1> I wish I could call myself a baker, that would be an awesome job <0> If it made more money than being an engineer than I would bake forever. <1> Well I am sure with the industrialization of baking, they hire fewer people and use machines in huge factories <0> It's sad that less bread is made in a less fake, manufactured way.

<0> My favorite food is pasta. It is a noodle made from unleavened dough. <1> Yes; I am a pasta eater too.  I shouldn't have the carbs, I guess; but pasta is great.  Spaghetti is among my favorite meals. <0> I love spaghetti. It is a long, thin, cylindical form of pasta. <1> Yes; I am also a fan of fettuccine, too.  What about you?  Is there much difference between fettuccine and spaghetti? <0> Fettuccina is a type of pasta popular in Tuscan cousine. The shape is flatter than spaghetti. <1> Interesting.  What other types of pastas are there? <0> Pasta can be divided into dry and fresh pasta. Water is added to dry pasta for cooking. My favorite type of pasta is lasagna. <1> Lasagna is really good, same with spaghetti and meatballs!
<0> Do you do any water sports, such as kayaking or canoeing? <1> I love to canoe! What about you? <0> I canoe too! Have you heard of canoe camping? It's a multiple day canoe trip, where you camp at the end of the day. <1> No! We've always just called that a canoe trip. <0> Nice!

Do you have kids? <1>  I agree. if I have <0> It's intersting, in many other cultures, other children care for the younger children. That doesn't happen in the western world as much.  <1>  if it is very interesting to see how the children take care of themselves in other places
<0> Do you like Gouda cheese? <1> i used to before i was lactose intolerant. a guy I used to work with told me that it's named after the dutch city of Gouda <0> Oh that makes sense, I never knew it was a dutch cheese. Do you know how long people have been eating it? <1> from what I remember around 1184 is when it's first mentioned anywhere so around then i guess, pretty long time <0> That is such a long time ago, are there any other cheeses that old? <1> honestly i'm unsure of the oldest but i do know that people used to make in a sheep's stomach so it's probably been around for awhile before 1184 <0> Wow, that is an old fashioned way of making it, I wonder if anyone still makes it that way. <1> i remember watching a tv show with Gordan Ramsey going around eating local food, and he watched someone make, and eat, it so i think some still do 
<0> I was content when I found out that I had passed a class in college <1> Cool.

<0> When I am stressed, I overeat. Last night I ate a whole pizza by mself! <1> I'm sorry! Sounds like you might struggle with overeating. Basically meaning that you eat an excess of food in relation to what you need. <0> Right! Are there any good ways to combat this weakness? <1> Yes! They actually have a few types of therapy that can help like group therapy, cognitive behavioural therapy, and individual therapy. <0> That sounds like what I need! I also think it would be great if there were some natural remedies. <1> It's nothing to be ashmaed of, everyone deals with stress in diffrent ways. I suffered from Anorexia for a long time. They have a group called overeaters anonymous you could try :) <0> Yes! I think group therapy is what would help me the best. I feel better when I talk about my overeating with others. <1> You should feel bad for treating your body so poorly.
<0> true . same could be said for pop i guess . you are right ! <1> yes lol i like pop an some songs off the chains <0> What do you mean by off the chains? <1> Just crazy songs in general I think! Like rock, pop, and hip pop <0> Huh! Ive never been too big of a fan of those genres but they arent bad! <1> Sometimes you have to be in the mood, but overall I love those genres
<0> Alien invasion movies are terrifying for me. Have you ever seen Alien? <1> Hard of it, harvest people for food, steal the planet's resource <0> Yes basically. Do you like the alien sci fi genre? <1> No, i prefer Stargate SG-1 <0> Did Stargate ever win any Emmys? I know it went on for a really long time <1> yes it did, but the show, created by Brad Wright and Jonathan Glassner, is based on the 1994 science fiction film

When I do it, I am like I am doing something that has been going on for over 7000 years.  <0> that is true, it is one of the most basic of human activities <1> It is impressive but also time consuming and difficult. <0> I can imagine, sometimes I much prefer just sitting and watching television <1> Yeah, it can seem daunting and TV is excellent for escapism. <0> my favorite is the walking dead, how about you? <1> The walking dead's great, although I'm a bit behind. I'm currently looking for something new to watch. <0> I highly recommend it, however everything on amc is good television <1> Yeah I saw Halt and Catch Fire on AMC, that was great. I still haven't gotten around to setting up my TV in my new house.
<0> My sister and I used to chase the ice cream truck when we were kids. <1> i used to get screwballs with my sister. those were our favorites  as kids <0> what are screwballs? I dont think i ever heard of that! <1> They are toys that came with ice cream treat, I tried to collect. <0> ahhhh.

Always good to save money! <1> If I can find a coupon for items, that makes me feel good about my spending money.
<0> I have never heard about them. What genre do they play? <1> They are pop punk rock <0> I am not great with genres to be honest, my little brother however is excellent at recognising them.  <1> They are similar to other pop punk bands such as blink 182 and Fall Out Boy, you should check them out! <0> I only know 1 song by blink 182, the one that goes nananana nananananana. Do you know?  <1> Yeah you might be talking about their song called All the Small Things <0> That's the one! I still sing it all the time with my parents and brother because we live together.  <1> haha same! My favorite song by them though is I Miss You. Really puts me in my feels <0> I'm sad to say that I do not know it. Do you have any other hobbies? I myself enjoy drawing. <1> I like drawing too! And watching lots of Netflix.

Are there any cures for obesity? <0> No cures but treatment includes changes to exercise and diet <1> That makes sense, diet is crucial. I try to follow a Mediterranean diet. <0> Is it true?
<0> my pet dog is always there for me. No matter what,  I can count on her. <1> I feel the same way about my dog.  They're the greatest!
<0> A group of coworkers who play the same lottery numbers every week won $100, 000 on the pick 6 last week. <1> that is so lucky,  they must be so happy they bought that ticket <0> They had asked me if I wanted to go in with them,  and I said no. I regret that now,  I could have really used a share of that money. <1> i know that is such a bomber you must have been so angry hahaha
<0> Recently moved to a new dorm and when i came in the kitchen was a total disaster. Months old piles of dishes in the sink with mold and dried up old food on the stove. <1> Holy crap! Is there not a landlord or something you can complain to? <0> I can but they take forever to come and clean it up. I just talked to the guy who did it and he said he won't do it again. Spent  an hour cleaning it all up with a lot of clorox,  alcohol,  and soap. <1> I'm glad I never had to live with other people. I would not be as patient as you. <0> How long have you been living with other people?

<0> I just brown hair.  I wonder how many people have brown hair. <1> Quite a lot!  It's actually the second most common hair color.  Second to black hair of course. <0> Is there a reasons so many people have brown hair? <1> Well it depends on the level of eumelanin.  If there is more, the hair color will be darker and vice versa.  Brown just happens to be in the middle. <0> Does the color of the hair change anything else about it? <1> Some people think it changes their personality

A great base, but too strict. <1> I suppose that makes sense. Also, the differences in dances around the world is something that intrigues me. So many cultures
<0> I was really apprehensive about going to university at the age of 30. <1> That's okay,  I'm 25 and still in college. How did it go for you?  <0> It went pretty well! I got great grades and made friends despite the age difference.

Sometimes I hear things come out of his mouth that I know he learned from me. <1> Hopefully the things coming out of his mouth are good things,  right? <0> I wish,  he sometimes says curse words. <1> Oh.  I recommend correcting that before it gets out of hand.  Good luck! <0> I truly try to correct him immediately everytime.

So it helps me in school,  and looks good on a CV for a full-time teacher position in an actual school someday in the future. <1> Oh thats good! Thanks for teaching. :)

There is always 1 thing that's missing im my fridge <1> True, although I used some of the services that deliver the ingredients to you for a specific meal, it's really useful <0> Hmm, I never thought about that! Do you cook at home a lot?  <1> All the time, it's so much healthier and much cheaper. With some planning you can have a good variety too

What did she do? <0> She answered back when i told her off for pushing another child. <1> Well, she better learn to be more respectful. People won't tolerate that behavior.

<0> i was so mad.  I came home and my back door was left open. <1> Did anything get stolen? <0> No, I must have left it open when I went to work.  <1> do you have security cameras that you can check? <0> I do actually.

He had the friend who made all the techy gadgets. <0> he also had a side kick named robin <1> But doesn't Superman kick Batman in strength and durability?
<0> When I see my wedding picture around the house I always think back to that day. <1> Does it make you feel happy about your life since then?
<0> When I was a kid, I would bake a cake for my dad's birthday and take it to his job at the fire station. <1> That's incredibly sweet. That's like the best birthday gift too, since it probably tasted really good, but then showed your time and effort all in one. I heard once to make them taste like a professional made it, you just add like extra eggs and sugar and butter or something <0> I miss those days. Now, both of my parents practice as lawyers for work. <1> That is important work though! I know they are doing great things <0> Oh no doubt. They love to argue though, maybe partly because of their job lol. I order everything on the internet and they worry about me getting scammed. <1> A completely valid thought, but it is way more convenient
<0> A friend who I hadn't seen in awhile showed up at my door <1> I'll bet you were surprised. Were you glad to see them? <0> I was very happy to see him,  we ended up going out for drinks <1> Did you reconnect and promise to keep in touch? <0> No I hate him a great deal.

<0> My friend was telling me about teaching jobs to apply for. I didn't get hired,  but she got one right off the bat! <1> It sounds like you're happy for her,  which is commendable given you didn't get hired. Were you very disappointed? <0> I was kind of envious that she got the job and I didn't because it seemed like I was more qualified than she was. <1> That's always tough. It's so hard to tell what other factors come into play in situations like that. Are you happy where you're currently at,  or still looking?

<0> pasta is a staple italian food <1> Pasta is so good, especially with tomato sauce. <0> pasta is great and has been around since 1154 <1> Wow that's so long! I wonder if it is the same as back then. <0> yea and it pasta was founded in italy, sicily <1> That makes sense, since pasta is so prevalent in Italian cuisine. <0> pasta has two broad categories, dry and fresh <1> Fresh will always be best though.
<0> Do you feel content with your life right now? <1> Somewhat,  ive felt better these past couple months than i usually have
<0> My upstairs neighbors make a ton of noise at all hours of the night. It makes it difficult for me to sleep.  <1> That really sucks. Maybe you should try egging their door? Or just break in and pretend you're bigfoot while they're trying to sleep. <0> I'm not trying to get arrested! I think I'll just wait things out until I move in two months. <1> I would go with the bigfoot option. You can get a costume on the cheap on ebay nowadays. I've used that tactic countless times and it has never failed! <0> The Bigfoot tactic does sound like a good idea actually.
<0> I love pasta if I could eat it everyday I would the noodles and flour taste just gets me I'm a starchy kind of girl lol. <1> I love mac and cheese. Any kinda carb really lol. <0> How about dumplings I love homemade dumplings with chicken, potatoes and fresh vegetables.  <1> I like them when they are cooked the right way. I don't like them dry. I wish I could make them.  <0> I totally agree some people like theirs fried I prefer mines in a creamy sauce boiling, simmering and steaming to get all the flavors lol. <1> Yes that's how I like them also. I've never had them fried. <0> I have once at this restaurant they just add banku and kenkey and roll the dough into little balls and deep fry them.  <1> I've never heard of that, what is it? <0> Kenkey is from Ghana it is made from a ground corn it is served with foods like fish, soup or stew.  <1> That sounds great, i'd love to try food from Ghana some time!
<0> i forgot to pay my credit card bill,  I'm so disappointed with myself. <1> I am sure it'll be ok. Usually if you stay in contact with them and don't blow them off for a long time it will be OK.

<0> I love coloring my hair! It's fun to play with all the different shades of dye. Have you ever colored your hair? <1> Yes, I have made it purple and red before. <0> Those are fun colors! Did you have it done professionally or did you dye it at home? <1> The red I did at home. The purple I had to have done professionally to get it to stick. <0> That makes sense! Home coloring is a huge business! In 2011, sales reached $1.9 billion and they're thought to have reached $2.2 billion in 2016. <1> I can see that from all of the commercials that are on TV. Do you notice that they always show basic colors like black or brown? <0> That's a good point! They do always show black or brown! Believe it or not, 75% of all women claim to have dyed their hair at least once. Surely they used some other colors! <1> I would think so! Although, I guess covering gray and making it look natural is responsible for most of those billions.
<0> Do you like water sports? Their are several commonly played sports that involve water.  <1> I do. I am a certified scuba diver. I love swimming as well. Do you do scuba diving? <0> There* Oh, wow! I haven't been scuba diving. Do you wear a dry suit that normally protects the body? <1> I used to dive in Turkey, Egypt so 5mm wet suit or 7mm half dry were enough. But in cold waters you definitely need a dry suit. I have completed my training but couldn't dive with a dry suit yet. It is so hard to dive with dry suit for me. Last time I tried it I went upside down in the water.   <0> Interesting! So the difference between dry suits and wetsuits is that dry suits prevent water from entering? <1> Yes dry suits do not get any water where wet suits get a bit of water inside but it does not let it go out so keeps you still a bit warmer as it prevents water moving
<0> she was in a car accident . <1> sorry to hear that . i haven't done anything illegal <0> Well that's good to hear, but quite besides the point. <1> I hope your friend is ok. My father was in a car accident back in the 70's. He drove a taxi cab. <0> She's doing okay, thanks. Yeah we forget how dangerous cars can be. where did he work? <1> In New York City. He saw a man get mugged and drove his taxi into the entrance of an alleyway to block the thief's escape. He was ok though. <0> wow, did they catch the guy? <1> They sure did. My father got an interview with a local news channel and my sister and I got to be there too. <0> That must be great footage to pull out at family gatherings.

<0> I wish i would learn to bake <1> Its an honourable profession. To bake and sometimes sells bread <0> yes, so do all bakers bake bread? <1> No, I guessI was just generalising the term but they bake an assortment of things in a bakery.  <0> yes, what are the materials or utensils used for baking? <1> You name it, baking trays, bowls, mixers, oven and the list goes on as there are numerous tools used. <0> wow, whats the major one? <1> I don't know, I don't know how to bake.

<0> I love baking, especially using an oven. <1> Me too. I like baking cookies. What do you bake? <0> I like to bake bread, as it is the most common baked item. Also cake and cookies. <1> I see, and what else do you know about baking? I am looking to improve my baking skills <0> The way that it works is that the oven transfers heat from the surface to the center of the baked good. <1> So that must mean the oven gets really hot, so i have to wear gloves when removing the baked items from the oven.
<0> i love german chocolate of course but enjoy good exotic fruit . <1> i bet it is better than the american stuff ! <0> And you are right. Sabroso, sabroso! <1> haha. Are you into dark chocolate?  <0> Yes, I am. I like to eat while drinking rum from Puerto Rico. <1> Yes, perfect match <0> Are you a chocolate lover yourself? <1> Yes. I love it, especially in the morning after yoga <0> Amazing choice
<0> Red is such a beautiful color, it sits next to orange and opposite of violet on the rainbow <1> what makes red red? <0> Well red red the dish is made of fish and blackeyed peas and onions and oil and tomatoes.  <1> when did the word first appear in history? <0> well in the renaissance the wealthy folk used kermes and cochineal to make brilinant red costumes <1> lol ok, what is the wavelength of the red color?
<0> So upset at my brother for trying to fight me <1> Brothers always seem to want to get into fights with one another, but at the end of the day, I'm sure you guys love each other very much! <0> We do, but we get competitive sometimes.  <1> Sometimes sibling rivalry dies hard -- even when you've well outgrown it. Are y'all far apart in age? <0> I'm 5 years older  <1> That's pretty close! Do you guys play football? It's my favorite. <0> we don't, but i love football too.  <1> It's a lot of fun. I play quarterback. <0> what's your favorite team? Mine is the Saints <1> I like the Ravens.
<0> I had to care for my younger brother last week while he was sick. I tried my best to make him as comfortable as possible.  <1> That's nice that you helped him. I'm sure he appreciated it!
<0> it made me mad to see someone put a dent in my door <1> Ugh I hate when people do that! Did they even leave a note? <0> No note, they don't want me to know who they are. I will have to use my own insurance to get it fixed. <1> That's a shame. I had a situation where my dogs scratched my car and I need to pay to fix it myself <0> I guess these things happen to all of us from time to time. Maybe I'll ask one of my 4000 Facebook friends for recommendations for a good body shop. <1> Wow that's a lot. I'm sure you'll receive great recommendations. I am studying astronomy, but I don't know much about cars <0> I would love to have the time to study astronomy. I live alone and am very busy with chores, so I don't have the time right now.

<0> I love baking! Are you a fan? <1> I am an avid baker! I love making cookies, pies and anything with yeast like bread.  <0> Do pies use yeast, too? <1> No, only doughs that you want to rise, like bread, pizza dough, doughnuts, etc.  <0> Oh, that makes sense! Are all doughnuts fried, or can you bake those, too? <1> The good ones are fried! I love how trendy doughtnuts have become.  <0> Me, too! I wonder what has made them pick up so much steam? <1> Maybe the new trend towards things can be eaten with your hands, like street food...it's all okay with me, I love to eat.  <0> What are some other examples of street food? <1> I gotta say that tacos are probably the street food that first comes to mind.
<0> hey how is it goin <1> great ! about to go get some tacos ! how are you ? <0> doin good and that sounds good , what kind of work you do ? <1> i'm a dog trainer , my sisters and i opened a service ! <0> cool i work in finance at night and do a little waitressing during the day <1> nice ! do you have siblings ? i have 3 older sisters and one little brother . <0> no i do not only child . do you like motorbikes ? <1> love them ! i go to alabama fest every year ! its down the road from my house . <0> my motorbike is the onl way to get around love the freedom <1> I wish i can go to alabama  fest one year

I doubt she would reject such a great guy like you. :)  <0> Thanks!

<0> When my girls were younger and playing softball sometimes I couldn't make it to all of their games. <1> Oh no, I know that must make you feel bad, but you can't always be there. <0> They love softball but I used to play when I was little and got kidnapped by my uncle one day after practice so softball games make me feel sad. <1> I hear that memory isn't very accurate sometimes... maybe it wasn't as bad as I remember? Your dad is a nice guy. <0> Yes, my dad is a nice guy but my uncle is evil. <1> Do you have the same relationship with your Dad? <0> No. My uncle kidnapped me and my dad did not. <1> Well, I guess it's good that you don't remember! Did either of your parents ever marry another person?

<0> I was diagnosed with stage four cancer yesterday. The doctor told me I have less than a month to live. <1> Are you serious? That is extremely terrible news to hear. :( 
<0> So it was supposed to rain,  but when I got out it was beautifully sunny. <1> Almost sounds like the erratic weather that we have here in Georgia.  I don't mind the rain as long as I'm inside.  The sun is beautiful but sometimes it can be brutal when it starts to heat up.  Do you prefer sunny days? <0> Sun is what makes me alive,  so definitely yes. <1> I have to be very careful in the sun.  My allergies and the sun don't mix too well.  I can tolerate the rain much better.  I love the sound of water. <0> I love basking in the sun, you should try it
<0> Saw an old cassette of my cousins fifteens and saw my mother before she passed away,  felt nice seeing her on video again. <1> Oh I'm so sorry but I bet that was very special of you to find. <0> Yeah sadly we don't have many videos of her but the few we have we keep them safe and stored. <1> I would definitely make digital copies and upload to a cloud or a disk in case something happens.

<0> i love fresh vegetables from the farmers market <1> i don't care for them . <0> Why not, they make any dish so much better <1> I just don't know how to prepare them I guess. <0> You can always find fun ways to cook them on the internet <1> I suppose but I never learned to cook and I would just rather eat a burger. <0> I like to cook because I can save some money and still have a good meal. <1> I just buy frozen burger patties and throw them on the george forman. Just like my dad before he got locked up. <0> Do you just eat burgers or do you have anything with them <1> I usually eat fresh vegetables with them. 
<0> hii do you hear abour jazz? <1> Yes, I love jazz. It originated in African-American communities in New Orleans.  <0> oh i didn't know detaily. please tell something about jazz <1> There's a lot to learn about it! Its roots are in blues and ragtime music, and it was originated in the late 19th to early 20th centuries.  <0> its interesting. ragtime music mean? <1> Ragtime music is basically music with syncopated rhythm, or "ragged", like the name says.  <0> oh nice.its a useful message to me
<0> I don't think I have ever tried it unless a friend had a toy with a breathing tube when I was a child at a pool or something. It sounds fun. <1> its pretty fun, if the water is really cold, people wear wetsuits to stay warm <0> sounds like a blast, i hope it goes well though. <1> its scary , but once you start to get the hang of it you'll like it. Definable an unreal experience. <0> What is so scary about it?

<0> My friend and I both did a low-carb diet last month. She lost 8 pounds. I gained 2!  <1> Wow,  great for her! I am confused as to how you ended up GAINING though!
<0> I really like the color red, its been my favorite color since i was a little kid. <1> I like red because of the emotions it represents, like fire and passion. <0> Exactly! IT can be very romantic also, like for valentimes day <1> Do you have a favorite hue of red? Like pinks to dark red burgundy?  Mine is a dark red. <0> My favorite is a light pink but thats kinda far from the color red. its just a different shade. <1> Yeah, more of a shade of red and more like its own color.  I wonder why pink feels more like its own color than dark red. <0> it looks so different and usually gives people a different type of energy. <1> I could see that.  Do you believe that pink references the feminine emotions like innocence and chastity?
<0> When I was pretty young, I witnessed my cousin fall and break her arm. It was completely disfigured and bent in odd ways. It grossed me out so bad I nearly vomitted. <1> i bet it did i would be too <0> i think i waas more afraid then she was <1> I would be too, seeing that can be so scaring <0> yes it really can its a kind of situation that sticks with you for life  <1> Thats why I always try to avoid climbing heights, to avoid breaking anything
<0> I'm over the road trucker. Man it gets boring in the evenings.  <1> I bet it does,  you should find a podcast you like <0> I listen to most of those as I drive. I was thinking of getting into gaming. I have a Tv in the truck and can buy a game system.  <1> That is smart,  I would recommend a nintendo switch! <0> I hate anything portable, it ruins the full gaming experience.
<0> I love Jazz music me and my friends go to a local Jazz club twice a month. <1> that sounds like fun. i like jazz its one of Americas oringinal art forms <0> That is great who is your favorite Jazz singer? <1> Sarah Vaughan was great in from 1924-1990 <0> It is so crazy you said I promise I love Sarah Vaughan as well was going to tell you that my favorite song of hers is the man I love very classic. lol <1> Wow awesome, She has been said to have "one of the most wondrous voices of the 20th century"
<0> My favorite color is Red. <1> Oh, neat! What shade of red is your favorite? Red can be scarlet, crimson, or even pink in shade. <0> I would have to say that my favorite shade has to be Crimson.  <1> Red is a cool favorite color to have, considering its history. Ancient Egyptians and Mayans would use red to color their faces during important ceremonies. <0> I would have to say my favorite shade would be Crimson <1> Red is considered to be a more romantic or aggressive color psychologically, which is why some heterosexual men think that red outfits enhance female attractiveness. It's so cool to think that color can make all the difference. <0> Isn't red also a primary color? <1> Yes, it is!
<0> I like doing word puzzles and Sudoku mostly <1> Some of the Sudoku puzzles are hard, the 9x9 grid ones, but they are fun to do. <0> Yes, They really are! I play football too <1> That's cool! I am terrible at sports but I admire people who are good that them. <0> I've been playing it since high school. Now I play in college <1> Wow, you must be really good then.  My husband played high school football too but stopped after a couple of really bad concussions. <0> oh that's too bad! Do you do a job?
<0> I am sure I will do well on my test tomorrow. Wish me luck. <1> Good luck. What is the class? <0> It's music theory. I love the product but the whole theory thing is a struggle for me. <1> Is that a hard class? what is the idea of the class? <0> It's not so much difficult as it is tedious. It's basically the rules of music. It's a lot of term memorization and whatnot. <1> Oh wow ive never heard of the class but it sounds interesting. I love music but never had a in dept look into it <0> It is very interesting. I think I would find it more interesting if it wasn't such an early class! What are you up to tomrrow? <1> I will be volunteering tomorrow at the locl soup shop for the homeless <0> Wow! Look at you! That's wonderful. Doing it with anyone or just going it alone? <1> I know the class well

Some of my fondest memories were traveling with my dad and grandpa in the circus and them introducing me to Beethoven. <1> We have that in common then. I can't say the same for my wife and three kids. They get tired of hearing me play classical lol. <0> Haha, I only live with my two golden retrievers, so they don't have much say in the matter. <1> Ah, I love dogs. Used to have a golden retriever. Now we have a miniature dachshund. If they howl at the music, they like it! <0> Haha, if that's the case then I guess a dogs favorite genre is "emergency vehicle sirens" <1> lol, maybe so. My dog seems to love the sound of a loud nearby train on that note.

<0> I have bad vision as well, I just wear glasses and contacts, I am sorry you are struggling with it <1> Yes it is crazy in this day and age that people do not have access to glasses or contact lenses. <0> Unfortunately, they can be expensive and it is one of those things that people try to do without if they can't afford it.n <1> Yes it is crazy how expensive it is just to be able to see when some people can just like..... wake up in the morning and see?  <0> Yes -- being a nurse - I see alot of patients who struggle - and not just with visual impairments. <1> This is very cool, my twin sister works in a hospital as well. Are you enjoying it? <0> Yes very much -- but its long hours and does take its toll. <1> ok how long you will stay

<0> the number 7 is a great number. <1> Absolutely, it follows 6 and precedes 8! What fun! <0> yea i love 17 as a number the most but both are good <1> 1 and 7 are very similar, it's important to distinguish the upward stroke of the 7 glyph from the long upward stroke in the glyph for 1 <0> yea those two can get confusing <1> Yep. That might also be why sometimes people use a horizontal line through the middle of a 7 in handwriting. <0> yea i like that style myself looks clean. <1> Yeah I think so too! Talking about numbers is so boring!

<0> Walking to a restaurant the other day and I forgot to hold the door open for an old lady,  felt so bad about it because she was right next to the door too. <1> It was nice of you to at least think of it. I'm sure she wasn't that upset. <0> I hope so,  i usually hold it open for everybody but i was distracted and didn't see her. <1> It's totally understandable. Life can get really busy sometimes! <0> I just feel bad because the old lady looked really frail and weak, she probably had to strain to open the door on her own.
<0> Fiction is a classification of story that is derived from imagination and made up <1> Ohh yeah, I love fictional books, especially novels. <0> fiction is used in so many formats too like writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games <1> That's what makes it so magical, it can be applied to almost anything. <0> Fiction is sometimes used as just literary narrative though <1> I don't read as much as I do play video games so that isn't the most relevant to me. <0> fiction is so cool though, pure creative imagination. <1> I know, it's only as good as they imagine it to be. <0> Id love to write ficiton myself <1> I'd be interested to read what you write. 
<0> I work at the local Target store. It's pretty easy. <1> Oh I love Target! It's the second largest discount retailer in the US.  <0> That's big. I guess Walmart is probably the largest. You seem knowledgeable, what else can you tell me about Target? <1> Well, the first one opened in 1962. They were briefly in Canada, I'm so sad it didn't work out.  <0> That's older than I would assume. And I wonder why that didn't work out! Do you happen to know how many stores they have across the U.S.? <1> Target's failure in the Canadian market was a downturn for them, but they have experienced revitalization lately. 
<0> Yes, I do have a fishing vessel. I love to take it out and try and catch fish. My boat is pretty small. Some are huge! <1> Some are really huge!  There are a lot of different kinds of vessels are used in commercial and recreational fishing. <0> One problem is that when I go fishing after getting a manicure, I ruin the polish.  <1> I would imagine that would hurt your nails! I have a boat if you ever want to go fishing on it! <0> Wow, that is really generous of you. How large is your boat? <1> Its a ten footer. I got it around 10 years ago when I was 60. <0> Cool, where do you have it docked? <1> right by the town docks. We should check it out sometime. <0> That sounds like a lot of fun, thanks. Do you have any other hobbies? <1> besides drinking and boating? No. Do you? <0> I used to compete in pageants when I was younger, and I still like to watch them. <1> Have you won any pageants before?
<0> So I'm on a serious diet with exercise to combat my obesity. I currently weigh 300 lbs. <1> Tell me about your diet? <0> I'm using the Paleolithic diet (which is also known as the caveman diet).  Very lean and clean. <1> So I'm guessing mostly fish and chicken, what are the benefits of this diet? <0> I'm not really interested in dieting or exercise since I'm not into fish or chicken.
<0> Ive always liked the lucky number 7. <1> me too, hindu people used to write 7 with one stroke and it looked like and uppercase J <0> huh strange how different cultures can differ, didnt know it was written like that anywhere. <1> even in cultures there are a lot of subcultures, most hindus speak hindi but bengali hindus speak bengali <0> yea just shows how each individual society has their own culture and ideas that even the number 7 can change. <1> in the case with europe, the number has evolved to look like the number gylph of one <0> yea its really weird, well this has been some useful info on the number 7. <1> yes and the number 7 is usually associated with luck, especially in gambling and irish folklore

LMAO i love simple jokes... <1> i have not but i should try it ! <0> Im not really into Cold weather but my roomie is an avid skier, in the winter, all he does is ski and watch cartoons #nolife <1> It's typically not as cold on the mountain, the air is thinner and usually dry. It's warmer that you'd think <0> Wow that sounds very difficult. 
<0> I love pasta! Which is your favorite, dried or fresh? <1> i love fresh if i can get it but its hard these days <0> Yes, it is. Fresh pasta was traditionally made by hand, but now fresh pasta is commercially produced, thank goodness. I'd rather buy it in a supermarket than make it by hand! <1> yea but at a restaurant fresh would be really cool and tasty. <0> Very true! Sometimes I eat pasta made with rice flour. It's not bad and it helps my gluten intolerance. Have you tried rice pasta? <1> i think i have but i dont care as much for it <0> Yeah, it's not the same. It's hard to believe that there are 310 specific forms of pasta. There's truly something for everyone! <1> Yea so many cultures have made a version themselves.
<0> Working at a daycare is tough work. I'm so exhausted everyday when I get home. Kids can be quite a handful! <1> Childcare also know as  daycare is the caring for and supervision of a child or children, usually from age six weeks to age thirteen <0> Yeah, I know. lol. Kids have so much energy. They are always all over the place. It's hard to have a silent moment! <1> It takes a lot Child care is the action or skill of looking after children by a day-care center, nannies and others <0> Have you ever had to babysit or look after a child? <1> yes, it covers a wide spectrum of professionals, institutions, contexts <0> It's a very important job, I might add, If were going to talk facts! haha.  <1> I agree, Early child care is an equally important and often overlooked component of child development <0> Many people think that a daycare shouldn't really be the person taking care of children. That they are much better off at home with their parents/guardians  <1> I would agree. Parents should play an important role in their children's lives. 
<0> Childcare involve supervision of children from ages 6 weeks to 13 <1> I have two small children in that age range. How about you? <0> I have 1 child in that age range and use to have a child around that age but he's 5 now and it also involves nannies, baby sitters, teachers, and day care centers.   It's so hard to find a good one too huh? <1> It really is! We had to put both of my kids (4, 6) into different schools just because they each specialize in something different. Plus, we have had to have help from family members when daycare times are crazy. <0> Early childcare is such an important part of a babies life too and development.  Just finding the right care that you can trust is so crucial <1> Completely agree. We tried one daycare for my youngest and I didn't think they were providing enough education. Even though they were great people, we had to move out. Have you ever had to leave a child supervision facility for a similar reason? <0> Oh yeah at one place we left because he was being abused.

<0> Rock and Roll is my favorite music genre, are you familiar with it? <1> I love Rock!  it is a popular music that originated and evolved in the United States during the late 1940s <0> Yes rock and roll evolved from from African American musical styles such as gospel, blues, jazz, boogie woogie,along with country music. <1> It did! And classic rock and roll is usually played with one or two electric guitars. but now we usually add a bass to the group. <0> In the earliest rock and roll styles, either the piano or saxophone was typically the lead instrument <1> While elements of rock and roll can be heard in blues records from the 1920s it was not called rock until the 50's <0> Besides being  a musical style, rock and roll, as seen in movies, in fan magazines and on television, influenced lifestyles, fashion, attitudes, and language <1> That is really cool, I have heard Greg Kot say "rock and roll" refers to a style of popular music originating in the U.S

We traveled all around the state performing at competitions. Do you enjoy jazz? <1> Yeah I like the improvisational nature it has. Many jazz musicians are seriously talented. <0> No kidding. My wife and I recently took a trip to the Mississippi Delta area, and the amount of jazz history in the area is astounding. We stayed in Natchez, Mississippi. <1> Cool, did you see any artifacts from the Natchez people? They were indigenous people that had complex chiefdom systems. <0> We didn't have time to explore that particular aspect of the area. We mainly focused on touring the numerous antebellum mansions in the area. Seriously, if you are interested in pre-civil war Southern architecture then you would love to visit the area.

Death hurts the living tremendously. <0> Yes death hurts, but I think I may have hit the cat myself I am a frustrated driver. I hope she did not suffer. <1> I remember a time my husband hit and killed our puppy with a car. It was very hard to deal with. <0> Samson was a good cat and she was a orange tabby. The weather was raining this morning and I could not see the road very well. <1> I am so sorry for you. Will you and your husband bury Samson yourselves? <0> Yes we will bury her in the backyard just as soon as it quits raining. <1> Do you have other pets? <0> NO !

<0> I love wine tastings, what about you? <1> Personally, I am not much of a drinker; but I do know a little about wine tasting.  It has been around forever, it seems.  But the methodology of it today was really established around the 14th century.  Do you have a preference on wine? <0> I like red wines most of all but will try it all. I am not big on drinking either, though <1> The white wines have a long history, too.  The white wines have been around for nearly 2,500 years, and they are produced through the fermentation of non-colored pulps of grapes.  Do you ever use wine in your cooking? <0> I have never dabbled with wine in cooking but would like to <1> Yes; I actually replace the wine with white grape juice in my cooking.  Sparkling wine is another style of wine that is used basically with carbon dioxide.  It makes it all fizzy and fun!

I just like noodles only <1> Oh really? Its a staple italian food but not usually by itself, what about sauce? <0> I usually just get some store-bought Bertoli's or Prego and put my own additional seasonings in it, like oregano, garlic powder, black pepper, etc. <1> Oh ok that sounds pretty good though when it comes to traditional pasta cuisine i prefer it with a meat sauce <0> I like to add a lot of chicken and sometimes sausage. 
<0> i go dancing on the weekends <1> me too . i love music . <0> the color orange doesn't suite me at all . what about you ? <1> i've short blonde hair so it actually works for me <0> that is awesome . i studied chemistry , yet work in a bookstore <1> i work at a grocery store but i want to be a fashion designer . <0> that's awesome ! ! i've a dog who competes and takes dog agility classes

You better knuckle down and burn the midnight oil! <0> If I work real hard, I think I can make it just in time.
<0> I just love pasta but I cant eat it right now <1> Really? Why not? I love it! It's a staple food in Italy. If was first discussed in literature in 1115 in Sicily.  <0> it has too many carbs for a low cal diet, I think Italy where it was first eaten right? <1> Yes! Maybe you can enjoy an alternative type like pastas made from rice flour? It's pretty good and has more protein.  <0> no rice or rice flour either, coconut flour or almond flour only. I wonder how many pasta dishes there are, probably too many variations to count I suppose <1> There's a lot definitely! It depends on the region where its made, with different shapes and types being popular to a specific region. <0> oh really I like all the shapes and types
<0> Is that it? I never owned a Betta Fish, I had a few goldfish when I was a kid. Do you know how long those live? <1> I do not.

Outside of Bettas I enjoy playing outside, how about you? <1> i'll watch them sometimes . i'd rather be outside honestly . fishing or hunting . <0> Agreed, outside things are so much more fun. The park is a great place to play and be with family. <1> I like walking at the park with my sister. We always have a good time.

Lots of Reddit. <0> My boyfriend loves Reddit too.

Italian cuisine. Family-oriented. <0> I do not like good meals

<0> My cousin just gave birth to twin boys <1> Wow, having two kids in the same pregnancy must have been an experience. <0> Well she had a daughter first but still it was a unexpected surprise. <1> In fraternal twins, each twin is fertilized by its own sperm cell <0> They and identical twins the look like you copy and pasted a baby <1> The birthrate of twins in the US rose 76% from 1980 to 2009 <0> That is kinda crazy!

<0> I used to have quite the problem with overeating, as I used to be pretty chubby myself. Have you had that issue? <1> Fortunately I've been able to avoid that problem. I know it can be a big issue during the holidays, as many people tend to overeat during those times. <0> That's true, since there are so many gigantic meals during that time and people don't care as much. <1> It can also happen during festivals because people have built up so much anticipation to the event, and we even encourage overeating sometimes, for instance Thanksgiving. <0> We certainly do encourage overeating in some cases, but it seems to be very rare and it seems like weight loss stuff is really popular around that time too. <1> Well I think the market for weight loss programs goes up during that time because they know people will be feeling bad about overeating probably, there's even 12-step programs for overeaters like Overeaters Anonymous. <0> I would bet that you're right about that. People get very self conscious around the holidays because of all the food. <1> Definitely, fortunately there are many beneficial theraputic ways to help stop overeating, like group therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy for example. <0> Good to hear, there's also a lot of self control involved in losing weight that a lot of people just don't seem to have. <1> Oh really? Explain why.
<0> Physical fitness is a state of health and well-being and, more specifically, the ability to perform aspects of sports <1> What sports are best for physical fitness? <0> All sports!

<0> I ate half a sandwich before realizing the bread was old and moldy! It was gross! <1> Oh no, I can imagine how you must have felt when you realized.  Did you get sick? <0> Luckily no, I either have an iron stomach, or I got lucky and didn't eat any of the mold <1> Wow that is lucky. Did you check the rest of the bread or just throw it out?  <0> Yeah the rest of the bread was bad too, so i tossed it.  <1> Since you didn't get sick, try to find some humor in the situation! I like to make people smile.  <0> They say you shouldn't cry over spilled milk. But what about spoiled bread?! What do I do for my carby breatheren <1> Haha! More like carby BREAD-ren! <0> Ha! could almost say another one bites the CRUST <1> We should really stop with these crumby jokes, can you toast to that?  <0> No really, let's stop.

<0> Hello, my favorite color is red. What's your favorite color? <1>  Red in strawberries comes from something called anthocyanins. By the way my favorite color is green. <0> I had no idea that's where strawberries came from, that's cool. The color green isn't acknowledged by some cultures, they consider it a shade of blue <1> Apparently some have used the word "grue" to describe this shade. It just reminds me of the guy from Despicable Me haha. <0> Lol that's actually a cute term for green, I love the despicable me movies.

Your costume should be red or grue. <0> Lol I prefer more recent video games like the fallout series, the whole backdrop of the game is a world after the post apocalyptic nuclear fallout has seeped into everything <1> Oh!  I love Fallout too.  ( remember I played it as soon as it came out.  What is your favorite part of Fallout?

I wonder how long people have been dyeing their hair? <0> The reason why people dye their is to cover gray or white hair <1> That seems logical I will probably do the same thing when I get older and go gray. <0> Yes, some people also see it as fashionabler desirable, to restore the original hair color after it has been discolored by hairdressing processes   <1> Wow that is really interesting! I guess hair coloring hair been around for a really long time. <0>  Today, hair coloring is very popular, with 75% of women and 18% of men  <1> I am surprised more men don't color their hair.

<0> I really like the color red, but it's getting old in my kitchen now. <1> Red is interesting, it is the color at the end of the visible spectrum of light, it's next to orange and opposite to violet. <0> It seems to be a very powerful color, but it's not very calming.  I think we are changing the kitchen to gray. <1> Yes it isn't calming, but there is many shades of red. From yellow-tinged scarlet and vermillion to builsh-red s=crimson, it can vary from red pink to dark burgundy too. Grey seems alike a much more calming choice. <0> Yes but it's probably going to be hard to cover the red on our walls - possibly need a primer <1> This can be true, res id pretty intense, I used to have a one wall in the bedroom painted a salmon color, it's kind of pinkish tone.

The most common baked good is bread and I can't even make that! <1> What are some techniques used for baking? <0> Well, one of the obvious ones is using an oven but you can also bake on hot ashes/stones.  <1> That sounds similar to grilling. I'm more of a grill type person myself. <0> Me too. Honestly, the closest I will get to baking anything is in the Easy-Bake Oven which is a working toy oven introduced in 1963 by Hasbro. Yes I know, my baking levels are that of a child. <1> I always wanted one of those when I was a kid. Do they still make them?
<0> bite the bullet and tell them . <1> thanks , that sounds like solid advice . <0> when I have a tough decision to make I go for long walks on the beach <1> Sounds good, for me it was playing a guitar that gives pease of mind. <0> you play the guiter? I like pop music <1> On my younger years I played it more though,  <0> you need to keep it up if you enjoy it! <1> The only thing I enjoy is being a primarily a meat eater lol <0> I am a big bbq fan, great food all around <1> There's no denying that <0> I cant imagine anyone being a vegan <1> Me neither, I think its more like a status like Oh look at me I'm sparing the animals kinda thing
<0> Hair coloring is the practice of changing your hair color <1> Do you work in a salon for a living? <0> Yes i do currently .  Another fact is that salons have been around since the early 1940s  <1> Do you know why they choose to call them Salons versus another name? <0> Not much information on that but i did find that women play a huge role within the salons <1> I agree! When I get my hair done it is very rare to see a male doing hair. I feel they would be more of a barber.  <0> Yeah i agree !  Another fact is that hair styling can be done on facial or body hair  <1> OH really! Body Hair is very hard for me to imagine. 
<0> One of my favorite stores to go to is Target. Mainly because they seem to have the best mix of quality and price. <1> Me too! Target was founded in Minnesota which is where I'm from. Everyone around here loves Target.  <0> Oh cool, how long has Target been around then? <1> Target was founded in the 60s in one of the suburbs of Minneapolis by the Dayton coorporation. Mark Dayton (of the same family) is now our governer! <0> Damn that's longer than I expected! How did he go from founding Target to being the governor?  <1> He didn't personally found it, but his family are Minnesota business tycoons and he is now one of the wealthiest people in out state. His family's wealth helped his political career. <0> Ahh okay that makes more sense. Must be a pretty powerful family with being that rich and holding positions in state government! <1> Yes they certainly are powerful! However he actually has a pretty good approval rating as far as I know, he also has helped our state budget stay in surplus though his policies.  <0> That's impressive, good thing he isn't just in that position because his family is powerful. <1> No. He and his family have a good reputation here. We all love Mark, and Target!
<0> hey ! want to help me take over the world ? <1> wow ? really ? i do not think it will work . . . <0> it might . we never know unless we try <1> take it over with what ? love ? kindness ? or war ? <0> fear . everyone could fear me . no one likes me anyway <1> that's not true , i like you . <0> well you are the only one . my kids do not even vast <1> visit ? they're probably just busy . <0> yes , visit . dang autocorrect . what do you do ? <1> looking for a job , like in a cafe or something . <0> im wishing you luck then. something should come along 
<0> Physical fitness is a state of health and well-being and, more specifically, the ability to perform aspects of sports,  <1> Do I need to do a lot of strenuous exercise to be physically fit? <0> Physical fitness is generally achieved through proper nutrition, moderate-vigorous physical exercise coupled with sufficient rest <1> I like to walk my dog and bowl. Will that make me fit? <0> Are you describing the Puppy Bowl is an annual television program on Animal Planet that mimics an American football bowl ? <1> That was funny. But no, I am talking about walking my do 20 minutes a day.
<0> hi there how are you doing ? <1> i am doing well . how are you ? <0> good just tired from painting my room purple with lime green <1> wow that sounds pretty . do you live with family ? <0> yes atleast for 2 more years till i graduate high school <1> cool ! my older sister lives with me right now . <0> so what are your likes and dislikes <1> i love travis scott and playing basketball ! <0> is he not the one having a baby by k jenner <1> you are correct , he's ! <0> i feel like her sister is more pretty <1> my mom , who is a dentist , hates all of them ! <0> haha yea so does mine <1> what is your dream career ? i'm looking for employment at a restaurant . <0> ceo of my own beauty products <1> That's cool, that would be neat to be your own boss.
<0> Ive been enjoying the summer. Ive spent a lot of time enjoying water sports. There are many different ones. <1> Which are your favourite? <0> My list of water sports include over water ones like skiing and wakeboarding. There are underwater and in water ones also. <1> What do you like to do underwater? <0> for under water water sports you can learn how to scuba dive. <1> Is that fun? <0> It is a very fun water sport. You can even participate in boat racing. That seems to reckless for me though. <1> Yes, that sounds dangerous!
<0> I am a computer programmer. I do not have a degree in it, though. <1> I'm studying to be a programmer and computer engineer myself. <0> That's awesome. I have two degrees in environmental engineering, but I love programming! <1> Oh cool! I want to get better at programming and software engineering since I'm not great yet. <0> You will get there! It takes years to master a subject and a craft. <1> Are you more of an engineer in your career than a computer programmer?
<0> I cannot wait until we go on vacation next year1 <1> i bet! I wanna go on vacation too! it's been a while. where are you guys going? <0> We are planning to go to Disney World, been saving for a while. Saving money with all those coupons! <1> That sounds awesome! I've only ever been to Florida in order to get to Disney World. Are you there to visit family? Business? To sight-see? <0> Well, I make it a two-for, I see the family and do the Disney thing. Then I help my Mom at the Shelter she volunteers at. <1> Thats really sweet of you to help her out.  What type volunteer work do you help with? <0> Working at the Kitchen, she's inspired me to buy extra at home on sale, and to donate the overstock locally. After the kitchen though...beach time! <1> That sounds like fun! Beach days are the best days! <0> Mom is a like a Coppertone ad! I worry about too my sun, either way she is always packed for the beach! <1> my kids love the beach , but i am sure you mean to relax right ? haha
<0> I like jazz. Do you? <1> I do like jazz.  I do not get to hear a lot of it but I enjoy it, <0> It originated in New Orleans in the 19th century, but it's been a staple since. I listen to it in the car while going to work <1> That is nice - I have mainly only heard it in clubs or restaurants. <0> Jazz is mainly associated with classical music, but it can also mix into other genres a bit. <1> What other genres is it part of? <0> Jazz is recognized as a major form of musical expression, and you could say it's ragtime, swing, or another <1> Oh yes - there were some great ragtime artists! <0> It's characterized by swing and blue notes, but it's the way it changes rhythm that I like <1> I don't like Jazz but prefer Rap!
<0> My dad's wife asked me to give her back the glassware she gave us at our wedding. <1> That's interesting.  Why on Earth would she want it back? <0> She found out that it has increased a lot in value and wants to sell it. She is very greedy. <1> Yeah, she sounds terrible. You shouldn't give it back. <0> I may give it back so that there isn't drama in the family. <1> You should sell it yourself, take the profit and tell her you don't have it anymore. <0> Do you really think that there would be enough interest in the glassware?
<0> I am starting back at school next month. I am excited about getting back into my classes. <1> That's great. What classes are you taking? <0> I'm a computer science student. The one I'm most excited about is Microprocessors. <1> That's pretty cool... Are you going to go towards hardware or stick with programming? <0> I want to be a software developer I think,  so I like the programming. <1> You should go all out and get a EE degree to go with it.  You can do microprocessor design.
<0> My street almost flooded very bad up to my garage because of the heavy rain today. I have things in my garage that I wouldnt want to get wet and didnt even think it could flood. <1> I do hate flooding as well <0> Yeah, I've lost a lot of possessions. <1> Wow, that is a lot.  Any serious ones?  They can often cause injury, death or property damage <0> Lost most of my music equipment last time it flooded.  <1> I'm so sorry to hear that, that's terrible. What kind of music equipment did you lose? <0> Amps, speakers and stuff like that. I'm really into music. <1> That's awesome I am too. I also like drinking expensive wine while I listen to music. What music do you like? <0> I like most music. Really enjoying ed sheeran right now he's probably my favorite artist at the moment. <1> Ed Sheeran's songs topped the UK and Australian charts, reached number five in the US, and has since been certified seven-times platinum in the UK. <0> Yeah he's amazing. I like to write poetry and he's a very poetic songwriter.  <1> it is rare to hear of people into poetry these days . <0> I agree, it's not as popular as it once was. So what type of wine are you into?
<0> Hello! I am considered obese, I currently eat a lot and weight 340 pounds. <1> Oh i'm sorry. I've been watching the biggest loser <0> Yes it's been a great motivation for me, it made me want to exercise but  I am too lazy. <1> Same here. But with warmer weather coming, I might <0> Yes me too. Not to go to the beach, but simply because warm weather is hard on my body. <1> Oh I enjoy the beach, like to tan <0> I don't like to tan, myself
<0> i do not go to the gym but i like playing a lot of tennis . <1> poor people do not get to play tennis and that's sad . <0> That is sad. What do you like to do? <1> I like to go on vacations. What about yourself? <0> Vacations are always good! Where is your favorite place to go? <1> Jamaica. Where is your favorite vacation destination? <0> Florida Keys <1> That is another of my favorite places. I was actually married in Key West. <0> Awesome! I love diving in the waters there.  <1> Do you go to the Keys often? I bet Pennekamp is one of your favorite dive locations. <0> I try to go at least once a year <1> Ever been to Fantasy Fest?
<0> Do you like Jazz Music. I'm getting into it as I get older.  <1> I like it a lot since it's really relaxing to listen to. You can definitely tell that it came from the African-American communities in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in America. <0> Yes, I listen to it at night while I cook dinner. It helps me wind down from a stressful day.  <1> That sounds really nice! It makes sense that I like it since I like the blues and ragtime and they're all very similar. <0> What's ragtime? I've not herd of it. <1> It's music that is characterized by it's "ragged" rhythm. Jazz though is known as "America's classical music", which is really cool to me.
<0> I'm thinking about coloring my hair soon, any tips? <1> For sure. Are you just ready for a change? The main reason people dye is for cosmetic reasons. <0> Yeah, just want a change from the norm. What highlight colors would go good with dark brown hair? <1> I think blond would look pretty good. <0> I'll have to give that a try! I wonder how long people have been dying their hair for. <1> I wonder too but today hair coloring is very popular. 75% of women do it. <0> That's surprising, actually. I wonder how common it is in men.
<0> hey stranger ! how are you today ? <1> i'm fine but my skateboard needs to be fixed <0> oh no ! what is wrong with it ? are you a pro skateboarder <1> yes , and my arm was broken when <0> ouch ! that's not good ! i do not do well with injuries , blood , etc . <1> my friends were all skateboarding <0> Ive broken a lot of bones in my life.
<0> It might storm tonight. I am a little scared to be honest <1> rain storm or thunder storm? <0> thunderstorms 
<0> nice ! well time for me to get back to studies . have a good day . <1> you are not very friendly , are you ? <0> My mother was a librarian, so I get it from her. <1> Oh, I see. Are you a librarian as well? I can see that you like to study. <0> I'm currently in school for writing but I spend a lot of time at the library <1> What do you intend to do with your degree? <0> Eventually I would love to teach writing to other people <1> That is a noble profession. You don't meet a lot of people that want to teach any more! <0> I know, it's unfortunate! <1> Unfortunate, indeed! I'm not the best instructor, so I just stuck with accounting. <0> We need those people, too! My number game isn't great so I'm glad people like you are available. <1> Glad to be at your service! <0> Thanks!
<0> I like to play games on PlayStation. The original console shipped 100 million units.  History made. <1> I enjoy the Playstation too, what kind of games do you play? <0> I like sports game.  My favorite game is Madden. <1> Oh I don't play sports games, I like Lego Harry Potter! <0> Yeah Potter games are popular. I wish better handheld games were made like when the PSP was popular in 2013. <1> We still have one of those too!  I don't use it for much, it was neat you could watch movies on it and hook it up to your TV though. <0> Hopefully something interesting will come out for Christmas.  It's been kind of bland since PS4 broke sales records in 2013. <1> That's true. They need to bring the PSP back.
<0> hello ! how are you today ? <1> good , i was just finishing looking thru my closet for old items . <0> are you looking for something special ? <1> yes . i found my old lite brite from the eighties . it was my fav . toy . <0> my favorite toy was the rubiks cube <1> very cool . i had one of those . <0> i work part time at burger king . what do you do for a living ? <1> i work with computers . but once a week i take dancing lessons . <0> nice i like dancing . but i do not like drinking or drugs . <1> same here . i was born in 1981 but i have never had a drink . <0> good . i just like to hang out with my friends and have fun . <1> I like going to the local dance club on the weekend.
<0> Have you ever rode a motorcycle? Harley-Davidson, Inc. (H-D), or Harley, is an American motorcycle manufacturer, founded in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1903; which is a popular brand <1> I've ridden with another person but never by myself.  <0> I have never ridden. I'm too scared. Under the Harley-Davidson brand, among them apparel, home decor and ornaments, accessories, toys, and scale figures of its motorcycles, and video games based on its motorcycle line and the community. <1> Yes, safety is my main concern with motorcycles. Otherwise the fuel savings and size are attractive features. <0> In 2014, the three top motorcycle producers globally by volume were Honda, Yamaha (both from Japan), and Hero MotoCorp (India)!! <1> Although imports are nice, I prefer American made brands such as Harley Davidson simply because of the brand loyalty.
<0> I had to compose myself and pull over to remove the spider. I'm so thankful that I didn't freak out and crash the car. <1> Oh that sounds so scary!
<0> boy , i'm starving . is it lunch time yet ? i love to eat . <1> i work at a convenience store if you want gas station food . <0> that sounds good . i travel and eat all around the world . <1> that sounds fun . i love gardening and eating fresh produce <0> fresh produce sounds great . i wish i could garden on my yacht . <1> do you have any phobias . i'm deathly afraid of clowns ? <0> i am afraid of cooking for people . i do not think i make anything edible . <1> that is a good fear to have . keeps you from killing someone
<0> i spend my extra time dancing <1> i am not good at dancing too big and clumsy . i can pet the bunnies though . <0> i was raised in somalia but now living in u . s . <1> i have a job in the shipyard when i'm not volunteering to pet the bunnies . <0> do you have an aunt <1> nope . did yours save you when you were forced to marry someone ? <0> no no huh my aunt help get me to the u . s . <1> i donate my money from the shipyard to the bunny rescue . they let me pet the bunnies .
<0> I wish I had brown hair instead of black, it is so pretty. I like that it can range in shade from light brown to almost black <1> I like brown hair too. <0> It is the 2nd most common hair color! <1> oh wow thats cool. <0> It is neat, the strands are thicker than strands of lighter hair, but not as thick as red hair strands! <1> oh wow that is quite weird.
<0> Man I can't believe I almost bought that thing! <1> What did you almost buy? <0> I saw this great used car in a print ad,  and went to the dealership,  but when I got there,  it was all ratty and crappy looking! <1> Ah,  yea,  I've had the once or twice. When you buy used you have to go in with the mindset of haggle down,  find a decent one,  or leave <0> Yeah,that was what i was expecting.But the car was in good shape. 
<0> I feel very good about my relationship with my partner. My partner values my opinion about things. <1> ok, so sweet <0> How about you, anyone that you can turn to? <1> Sure, I have friends who I am always free to share with <0> I like to go mountain biking with my friends. <1> I have never done that.  Not really the physical activity type, but I'd be willing to give it a try, I guess <0> I also like to go for bubble tea, it is so much fun. <1> Now that is more my speed. It tastes kind of strange, but I like it <0> Exactly, it is weird but I keep going back for more. So strange. <1> Yea, it's just one of those things. Once you start on it, you can't stop <0> Is there anything you really enjoy doing? <1> I like to unwind with friends, have a little drink, that kind of thing <0> Seems like a pretty chill thing to do, I'm fairly laid back also. <1> That's good. Do you live in a house or apartment?
<0> When I was a little girl I would have to wear shoes with holes in it to school. Everyone made fun of me all the time. My family could not afford much. <1> that must have been embarrassing,  I hope you weren't to traumatized
<0> I love to work out. How about you? <1> I know how good it is, but I can't get a good routine down. <0> A long time ago people considered fitness to be the ability to carry out your day's duties without getting very tired. <1> It's unfortunate that there are so many jobs now that don't involve any physical work. <0> I agree, manual labor was the primary form of completing physical work, so nowadays people try to make up for the lack of physical jobs by exercising. <1> What are good exercises? <0> Bodyweight exercise is supposed to improve strength, endurance, flexibility and concentration. It uses your own body weight rather than weights or machines.
<0> good afternoon  i have purple hair, yes purple <1> Love it!  I assume you dye your hair with hair color as opposed to brush in color that washes out?   <0> i use dye, it lasts longer <1> Yeah, it would be a pain to put color in every day.  Sounds fun!  I love seeing colors like that in people's hair and I even love the gray styles that are so fashionable these days.  Me, I need to dye my gray hairs I'm getting and I'm too young to be getting them! <0> :) i do like the gray style look but I like to have some color <1> I hear ya.  I love the mermaid gray and green and purple combo too. or pink! Hair coloring can be done by a professional or at home...which do you prefer? <0> i prefer professional work when it comes to my hair, what do you prefer?
<0> hello . how are you today ? <1> i am great . what are you up to tonight ? <0> not much , just thinking about my day tomorrow . gonna be busy <1> yeah ? what do you have going on ? <0> i am a wrestler , and i've 6 matches tomorrow . and i've to work out . <1> that does sound like a busy day . i'll probably lounge by the pool . <0> nice . i like pools . wish i had one . <1> i am a pro tennis player . i got the pool for the low impact exercise . <0> sounds awesome . who is your favorite tennis player ? <1> me ! i really need a cocktail . it has been a long day .
<0> I love the colour red. Its so vibrant. <1> I do too. It really pops! <0> We couldnt have any cool RGB things in our computers without it. Its one of the primary colors. <1> What does it mean to be a primary color? <0> It means that with the use of combination of those 3 colors you can make almost any color. Red sits at the end of the spectrum, close to orange, but opposite of violet. <1> Oh ok, I understand. What are the other primary colors? <0> Green and blue make up the other two colors of the RGB color model.
<0> Yea it tore through teh box office <1> It really did! It did as well as the sequel to the other Avengers movies should have. <0> I enjoyed it better than the other movies, I was on the edge of my seat the whole time <1> Yeah.  The only thing I didn't like was how many people in the theater insisted on talking to the screen! <0> That’s annoying! I hate it when people throw popcorn too, so wasteful! <1> lol. I'm very particular about movie theater behavior--having your phone out is another irritation of mine. <0> Or crunching and rustling sweets. I get very irritable when that happens.  <1> It's a lot of irritation to put up with considering how expensive it is to go to the movies now! <0> One near us has dropped its prices. They still charge a lot for popcorn and dodgy hotdogs thought.  <1> Ha!  We actually still have a working drive in movie theater out here that is nice to visit in the summer <0> I have never been to a drive through! I don’t think we have them here.  <1> i think a lot of them have closed down, but it is a cool experience if you can find one <0> I really do not care for all of these Avenger sequels
<0> That sounds dangerous. Is it worth doing such a dangerous job? <1> Wekk it is okay is you are well trained.  There are three levels: Apprentice, journeyman and Master. <0> Which level are you at? <1> I received on-the-job training when i first started <0> Thats great! How long have you been doing this work?  <1> For a good number of years now. <0> Sounds like it could be a dangerous job at times. <1> That it is,especially if you dont take the proper measures <0> Well you have entered a trade that will always guarantee you some work. <1> Thats true,especially in this economy
<0> I'm glad I can trust my husband to always be there for me. <1> That's sweet! I have a great husband too! How long have you been married? <0> Just under two years. Still feel like a newlywed@ <1> That's great! We've been married for almost 10 years and I still feel like a newlywed. It's great when you marry your best friend. <0> Yeah it really is nice to always have someone in your corner.
<0> I got a notification on my phone that I had a package delivered and went to look for it <1> Too late I already took it. Just kidding,  did you find it? <0> I did,  they left it sitting in the middle of the driveway so it could get run over! <1> Oh,  that's bad. Was there anything important in it?
<0> hello , how are you tonight ? <1> i am good and how are you ? <0> i am doing well thank you . finished up a batch of brownies . <1> that sounds yummy . i want some brownies <0> they are so easy to make . do you knit ?
<0> Do you have brown hair? I think it is a very common hair color. <1> I do have brown hair, but it's almost black. Brown hair is the second most common hair of all the coors actually. <0> That's interesting. It must be a dominant gene trait then since so many people have it! <1> It trusly must be. It's crazy though that brown hair varies so much. It goes from light to almost black <0> Yes, I like how there are so many varieties of brown from red tints to black. Mine tends to be more mousey brown, so I like to lighten it. <1> Yes, it's great that brown hair is actually more common in the western parts of the world. <0> I could see that, so it must have a base from European heritage then. <1> I do know it is a bit in Scotland because they call it "brun" <0> How cool! Actually I guess a lot of Europeans have darker features like brown hair color and brown eyes. <1> yes you are light and it is a common thing among them which they can be identified with.
<0> Sometimes when I am out in public,  my son throws a tantrum. <1> Oh yeah I am right there with you,  I just don't even go out anymore if I can help it! How old is yours? Mines 2 1/2 <0> Mine is 5.  Every now and then,  he says a curse word,  uses it properly too! <1> They are too smart for their own good <0> Yeah, my only daughter likes to curse as well.
<0> hello from manhattan ! how are you this morning ? <1> great . hello from florida ? what you are up to this morning ? <0> waiting for my morning paper to get here , you ? <1> just took the dogs for a walk while the kids and wife sleep in ! <0> i am in finance , i've to be up mornings or i would sleep in . <1> that's exciting . i am in it so i work all hours of the day and night . <0> i do too , mainly in overseas finance . <1> do you pay attention to oversea sports ? i enjoy all american sports . <0> no . i don't like sports . i'm going to business school in a year . <1> oh that's interesting, what are you studying in school?

I am Brand Loyal as well. <1> That's great! What is your favorite brand?
<0> Yes, I liked the small quaint feeling of growing up there. <1> Is that true the license plates carry the state motto, "Live Free or Die"? <0> Sort of, a specific state may have that, doubt it, but every state has something different. I know New Hampshire doesn't, I grew up there. <1> What was on that plate?  <0> The leaves fall where they may.  <1> aww that's pretty, would make a nice tattoo quote. Do you have any tattoo's? <0> I have a few tattoos, do you? <1> I've got three, all tiny though <0> Are they in sensitive spots? <1> no, on my wrists and inside of forearm <0> True. Read a lot of books? <1> I used to before my degree, but kinda gone off it now
<0> hi i'm danny and want to be a dog when i grow up <1> hello ! i have two dogs at my house . <0> you cant give a dog chocolate candy , but i'll take it <1> i know . once one of my dogs ate a whole batch of chocolate brownies . <0> my mommy and daddy helped me sing the abcs <1> that's good . what do you like to do for fun . <0> looking at blocks and shapes and singing <1> that's fun . i like to play with my dogs and go to the gym . <0> what is your dogs name ? <1> my dogs names are lady and nina . what would you name a dog ? <0> i would name a lady dog gidget . and a boy dog brownie
<0> Hi, what is your opinion on obesity? I think it is certainly a problem and nobody respects people who try to live healthy I feel like <1> What do you think obesity is caused by? I feel like if people would be more active that would help <0> I think that is part of it, but also, it takes a lot of discipline to make your own food, and since all fast food is essentially bad for you, people can make wrong choices very easily <1> It is sometimes about poor choice, but there is also a genetic component that is linked to obesity. <0> That is true, I think if your choices are poor you will be in worse health regardless, but there are certainly uncontrollable factors as well <1> I do believe it is a larger problem in the US vs other countries. This has to be chalked up to a combination of factors.
<0> My neighbors really look out for each other <1> That is good to hear. What happened that made you think so? <0> They always holding hands and smiling <1> Oh ok. That sounds like they really get along well. It is nice to have good neighbors.
<0> Isaw the most amazing sports play yesterday! I was shocked. <1> Oh really, what was the play? <0> It was in the Warriors basketball game, did you see it? <1> No I have not, must be exciting to watch it though. <0> I love basketball, I used to play in high school but I don't play much anymore. <1> I see! Why don't you pay anymore? <0> I just don't have the time anymore. People still assume I'm a basketball player because of my height though. <1> Are you active in any sports? Height can actually significantly influence success in some sports. <0> Not really, how about you? <1> i've played competitively for about 15 years now <0> Wow that's amazing, what teams have you played for?
<0> You need to be happy for you to live longer <1> of course,  like they say happiness is contagious,  if you are happy everything around you stays happy and it will be hard to die young
<0> As a child,  I was mean to my sister all the time and I still feel awful about it. <1> Aw,  well when your younger you don't do those things on purpose. I think everyone is mean to their siblings every now and then.
<0> hi . what are you doing this fine day ? <1> just enjoying my amazing grandchildren , and the great weather . <0> i've a lot of grand kids and great grand kids . i am 100 after all <1> oh wow , i am old too . i don't even own a smartphone . <0> it is funny . remember back when people didn't even have tvs ? <1> i do ! and , i still sew my clothes myself . <0> that's the way to do it . are you strong and healthy still ? <1> Yeah, or the most part, I am in good health, and since I can drive, I can get where I need.
<0> Oh how I miss my days when I was in my twenties. Those were such fun times. To be young and free! <1> Yeah we dont thinnk about how special it was until it is gone <0> It is so true. We take it for granted. I wish I knew then what I know now.

<0> Superman is my favorite fictional superhero, how do you feel about him? <1> He is pretty impressive.  He can fly which must be pretty amazing.  if you could have any superpower, what would it be? <0> His powers aren't as intimidating as the potential superpower Russia is becoming <1> Now that is very worrying.  I watch as much as I can on the news about it but I still feel ignorant <0> China and PRC are much more of a worry simply because they have slowly become the leader of the world under everyone's' nose <1> Really? I just dont know enough about this.  Sorry to be stupid but what does PCR stand for? <0> Peoples Republic of China. United States-China relations have not been good. You should look into the "Pivot To Asia" movement in US politics <1> Oh thanks for the explanation.  It seems pretty obvious now.  i think I will look into that as I want to feel informed about what is goin on.

What about yourself? <1> Cool! Well im still in school but afterwards hope to go to trade school and be a home builder one day <0> What types of home would you like to build?

What about you?
<0> I'm always surprised at how many people suffer from obesity in the US. It's so unhealthy to carry all that extra body fat! <1> I unfortunately suffer from obesity, it's tough. <0> A few cases of obesity are caused primarily by genes or some medications. <1> What about diet or lack of exercise? <0> Absolutely. The most common cause of obesity is a combination of excessive food intake and a lack of exercise. <1> What are some steps to battle obesity? <0> The best way to prevent or combat it is through a combination of social changes and personal choices like eating less and exercising more. <1> Does sugar intake contribute to the prevalence of obesity?
<0> I love rap music. <1> Rap is popular worldwide especially in Europe. I dont know too many non UK rappers though. <0> Neither do I, I prefer USA rap. <1> I love 90s rap like Snoops first album. I dont listen to too many artists nowadays especially mainstream rappers. <0> Snoop Dogg <1> I cant believe hes not as best selling as other artists. Hes only sold 35 million albums around the world. <0> I have met Snoop Dogg before. He was really cool. <1> Do you have a favorite song from Snoop. Mine is definitely Gin and Juice. <0> I love Gin and Juice also. But I would say Who Am I. <1> That's a great song too!
<0> I was thinking about purchasing a new vehicle and saw a nice red one I liked. Do you like red? <1> Yes I do, mostly because of the history behind the color. The red pigment was actually one of the first colors in prehistoric art. <0> I remember reading that before, and it was quite a precious dye many years ago. <1> Absolutely, the history extends even to the Ancient Egyptians and Mayans, who colored their faces red during ceremonies! <0> It's amazing how the color can have so many different meanings, depending on the context. <1> Not only so many meanings, but so many different hues itself, ranging from yellow-tinged scarlet and vermillion to bluish-red crimson even!
<0> My hamster Donatello just died. <1> I'm sorry to hear that. How long did you have him?  <0> I had him for two years. He was my best friend.
<0> Me too! It is so nice around here, I don't like the city life. <1> technically speaking they say anything not urban is considered rural, that does not sound right to me <0> I agree, suburban is a category too <1> I agree, that's why I favor smaller towns opposed to big cities. Just not my thing. <0> I don't like huge cities, too much traffic. <1> i used to sit in 2 hours of traffic daily. no longer is that my problem <0> Where was that? <1> new york  but i recently bought a lottery ticket. <0> I have never been to New York but would like to visit.

My fave flavor is lemon so any time I can, I like to make lemon cupcakes. How about you? <0> I use a method called pressure cooking using water and other liquid in a sealed vessel <1> I bet that's fun. I've been baking for a long time and it's definitely a fun thing to do on the weekends. What is your fave thing to bake?

What made you decide to volunteer at nursing homes? <0> My dad recommended it after my grandma was in one. I just love being able to help, and cheering them up! <1> That is so sweet, you are such a good person.

I don't know.  <1> That's awesome, I wish I had someone in my family that was involved in Jazz — or any music genre for that matter! <0> That person could be you. jazz is deeply rooted within the black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience,make it your own! <1> You are right! I will definetely start today!

They are rather amazing. <1> I have never seen a red panda although I understand it has reddish-brown fur and a long shaggy tail. <0> Yes, did you know that China owns all pandas in the world? We only have them in zoos because we lease them. <1> I understand that panda diplomacy is how China diplomatically gifts pandas to other countries. <0> Yes, this is true but still only for a lease.

What'd she do before working on the pilot? <1> I believe she did The Princess Diaries 2, but im not sure thats exactly what she did before hand <0> My sister loves that movie! we used to watch it all the time when we were kids. <1> I haven't watched it. Is it on Netflix? <0> I think so? It might be on Hulu actually <1> Shoot, I dont have Hulu

<0> Brown hair is the second most common human hair color <1>  What did you say that? <0> The color  can  be anything  from light brown to almost black hair. <1> But almost black hair is not brown <0> Brown is brown dude! the cause is that there are higher levels of the dark pigment eumelanin and lower levels of the pale pigment pheomelanin. <1> Do black people have brown hair or black hair? <0> I am not sure because I have never been out of West Virginia and I see very few black people , however,  People with brown hair are often referred to as brunette <1> Well, I think black people can have all kinds of natural hair colors depending on their genetics.

Crazy that the kind of power in both the gravity and the medium can be *stopped* by a cold enough temperature! <0> No not in person I have not but I'm sure it looks beautiful from how the ice crystals form. <1> We lived in Chicago a couple of times, and it was amazing how the waves of Lake Michigan could freeze.

What's your favorite thing to bake?  Do you have any secrets? <1> Yes Regional street food like tacos. <0> I didn't realize tacos could be baked.  I suppose the tortillas can.  Tell me more about baking, though. <1> In North America, tortillas are made from ground corn. <0> Wasn't American corn at one point called maize? <1> That's right! Domesticated by people of South Mexico ten thousand years ago.

<0> The future looks bright though right now things are not going as i had planned <1> What are you going to do to change that?
<0> I love taking showers! I do not know how I would live without the modern showers. In ancient times people would pour jugs of cold water over themselves and consider that a shower <1> It would be like living in the stone age.  WHen were showers first invented? <0> Well that is hard to determine because original showers were neither indoor structures of man-made, they were actually formed by natural things in nature such as waterfalls.  <1> When did modern showers become common <0> The Ancient Greeks were actually the first people to take showers, but the date is unknown. <1> Really?  So before that everyone took baths  <0> Yes, they used to take baths in basins, but found out that showers were a lot more efficent <1> Personally I like baths.  They are so relaxing.
<0> Physical fitness is one of the most important aspects of my life what about you? <1> I also value physical fitness. <0> i often do physical activities on a regular basis to keep me fit, do you often do physical activities? <1> Yes and I also do proper nutrition. <0> That is really good for your health i do it as well trying to keep myself healthy <1> I also make sure I get sufficient rest. <0> I am often lazy about working out
<0> good evening , how are you ? <1> i am doing well . how are you ? <0> i am not doing so good . <1> what is wrong ? my wife is a doctor if you need help . <0> for starters i can't stand school i hate it so much <1> oh , are you still in high school ? <0> no i am in grammer school and i am only 12
<0> I completely ate the last cupcake even though I know my husband will want one when he gets home. Should I go get some more? <1> Oh,  I know how that goes. My husband loves sweets,  but if it is just sitting there and no one is eating it It will get eaten right then. Getting another would depend on how much he likes sweets and needs them. lol
<0> Hello, yesterday was my birthday and my wife completely forgot! <1> It's alright maybe it's a working day and she has a surprise for you on saturday <0> She could have at least said 'Happy Birthday' or SOMETHING. I can wait for the gift! <1> That is true. Maybe she just honestly forgot. I wouldn't take it personal though. She has alot on her right now with the death of her mother. <0> That's true. I want to be empathetic, but she's really hard to read these days. <1> I know this is a difficult time for both of you. Her grieving and you trying your best to shoulder alot of things she use to do. <0> I wish I could just get into her head and figure out exactly what she needs from me. <1> take care and spend time with her . we could all be gone tomorrow .
<0> I had a great time hiking with my family and dog recently! Do you like nature? <1> I do.  It feels great to get out into nature doesn't it? <0> Yeah I always enjoy hiking in the mountains or just going to the beach.
<0> Do you ever experiment with your hair color? I love hair coloring. <1> I do! I actually just got my hair colored yesterday! I don't do it myself but I love going in to get it done. How about you? <0> I really love it, I usually go get it done professionally by a hairdresser. I have had disasters at home trying to do it myself! <1> Oh no! What kind of disasters? I get it done professionally as well. It's expensive but it is worth it. I have a wedding to go to this weekend so I thought I would splurge and get it dyed.  <0> I have tried to change my hair color from brown to blonde on my own, and it comes out very bright or tinted orange in spots. Bleaching your hair at home is tough! <1> Yeah, I have heard stories about bleaching hair at home that didn't turn out well. More often than not it damages hair as well.   <0> Yes, it can be damaging. Better to get those shades of blond like strawberry blond or pale blond done by a professional.  <1> Yeah! I think strawberry blonde is pretty. I tried to go blonde recently but I didn't love it. She did a blonde balayage but I am more of a brunette. I do like the colors that have a red tint though, like strawberry blonde. But those colors can be especially tough to do at home. 
<0> I am always so tired.  I'm beginning to wonder if I have chronic fatigue syndrome. <1> If you do, you can treat it with cognitive behavioral therapy. <0> what does that consist of? <1> It focuses on coping strategies such as problem solving. <0> Are there any other therapies available? <1> Some sources say rintaloimod, a medication, might help.
<0> I see a lot of work coming up at my job <1> How so?
<0> not much . working around the house . how about you ? <1> heading out soon . taking my honda to the shop . my dad gifted it to me . <0> I have a Honda also.  They are great cars.  <1> they're nice cars and very fast ! My favorite was the old prelude <0> I liked those, too.  I have a Pilot now.  What kind of Honda do you have? <1> I have an accord. <0> I had two accords before my pilot.  That was nice of your dad to gift it to you.  My parents passed away.  <1> Yes. It was hold car. I do have a very unhealthy diet that consists of beer and lots of snacks. <0> Did you mean "old" car?
<0> are you in college ? i'm an art major <1> i'm not in college , i graduated with a doctorate degree <0> that's neat . i am visiting europe again this year , have you ever been ? <1> farthest i've ever been away from home was at the park <0> do you have any hobbies ? <1> going to the park is my favorite hobby . or going to my daughters piano concerts <0> i enjoy traveling and cooking . <1> what kind of stuff do you cook ? <0> paella is my favorite dish to cook . <1> i've never heard of it . <0> it is a rice dish from spain .
<0> My elderly neighbor just recently had to put her dog to sleep. That dog was her best friend and companion. <1> That's sad. is she going to get another one? <0> No, and it really isn't fair that bad stuff happens like this <1> It is sad. If I were in charge of the world, stuff like that would never happen :D <0> If I was in charge, bad people would be punished <1> I dunno. I don't think there are actually THAT many people who are truly bad. Most have just had bad stuff happen to them <0> Well where I'm from, we help each other out and I can't stand bad people, they deserve what they fet <1> Where are you from? <0> Texas, the family state! How about you? <1> Missouri, the "nothing much in the middle" state <0> Haha that was funny! How big is your family? <1> Small family. Just me and my daughter, but I have a lot of extended family around You?
<0> the world is such a disgusting place now,  i wish i was born back in the 70s  <1> Yeah,  70s were incredible,  the dancing the cars,  the women had style and the music was incredible. <0> RIGHT?! but now is just so bad,  i wish i could go back <1> But we got to make the best of it,  pretty soon elon musk will release flying cars and then life will be amazing again. <0> Yeah, I just hope the future gets better.
<0> I love pasta! Which is your favorite, dried or fresh? <1> i love fresh if i can get it but its hard these days <0> Yes, it is. Fresh pasta was traditionally made by hand, but now fresh pasta is commercially produced, thank goodness. I'd rather buy it in a supermarket than make it by hand! <1> yea but at a restaurant fresh would be really cool and tasty. <0> Very true! Sometimes I eat pasta made with rice flour. It's not bad and it helps my gluten intolerance. Have you tried rice pasta? <1> No, I dislike all kinds of pasta.
<0> One time when using the public restroom,  I had toilet paper hanging from my shoe when I went outside <1> Oh man! I hope no one noticed. 
<0> I used to know a few back in high school <1> Historically they've been used as signaling devices, like for battle and hunting - it's only been since the late 15th century they've been musical. <0> Have you ever tried to play a trumpet? <1> I haven't, but maybe I'll give it a try! <0> It's great fun. I also enjoy playing other instruments. Not ones traditionally used for signaling though. <1> Alrighty then!  Maybe I'll give it a shot! <0> What activities are you involved in? <1> I really enjoy aquatic sports. I love the ocean! <0> Oh cool. I've thought about joining my school's swim team, but am too nervous to try. Definitely wouldn't be in the ocean! <1> have you swam before?
<0> I think Yamaha products are pretty cool! What do you think about them? <1> I have never used a Yamaha product actually, but I know they make musical instruments <0> Now that I think about it, they do. They are pretty diverse with their products but I think that they are overall recreational.  <1> Now that I think more, they do make street bikes, but like smaller versions of harley davidsons <0> It's pretty cool that they make that. I would love to try out one their snowmobiles. I've never used one but they seem quite reliable. <1> I have always wanted to try a snowmobile, snow recreation in general is a favorite of mine, and quick travel in a big blizzard would be cool <0> I would love to be on more mild terrain but think it would be a life saver in a situation like a blizzard.  <1> Speaking of Blizzard, have you ever played Starcraft 1 or 2? 2 is my favorite, Blizzard did a fantastic job making that game
<0> I've got banana bread in the oven right now -- do you bake? <1> Yes just cupcakes and cookies. That banana bread is sure good with those mashed bananas. <0> Totally.  What's your favorite thing to bake?  Do you have any secrets? <1> Yes Regional street food like tacos. <0> I didn't realize tacos could be baked.  I suppose the tortillas can.  Tell me more about baking, though. <1> In North America, tortillas are made from ground corn. <0> Wasn't American corn at one point called maize? <1> That's right! Domesticated by people of South Mexico ten thousand years ago. <0> That's a long time ago.  So, does that mean the Aztecs grew it? <1> Yes the Aztecs grew it. What do you know about the Aztecs?
<0> Do you have brown hair? I have super dark brown hair, its really long too. <1> Me too I have brown hair it is the second most popular color, the first is black. <0> when i was a little girl, i had blonde natural highlights through my hair. now its just brown with some grey streaks haha <1> The color is due to pigment eumelamin, the more eumelamin there is, the color will be darker.  <0> ive always wondered about what casues the color change! Do you know any other interesting facts about hair? <1> There is more hair one the head of people of darker hair color.  <0> so blondes are always have thinner hair? <1> most of the time blondes have thinner hair.
<0> I went to a concert by myself because all my friends were too busy doing other things. <1> Aww thats too bad that no one else could go.  What concert was it?
<0> I watched a stray dog yesterday that had a lot of tick,  I felt bad for her. <1> Aw that's so sad! Did you help it? <0> I didn't,  I don't know why,  maybe because I hate ticks. <1> I guess that's fair,  but I probably would've taken it to the vet. <0> I didn't want to get stuck with a vet bill, so I didn't call anyone.
<0> Have you been to Canada? <1> It has ten provinces and three territories 
<0> About 5 years ago, I went to a swimming pool. In the showers, some kids made fun of my body. I felt bad about it. <1> kids can be so hurtful, be happy about who you are! <0> Thanks! I'm getting over it. I wish I've been to more places! Specially to a city <1> You have to stay strong I get teased all the time about my occupation as a short order cook at a local diner. <0> Yeah! Everyone has their own story! What's there to tease about what you're doing! <1> I guess I am not making as much as my other friends or associates <0> I'm the same! <1> It's ok I learn to destress from it all. Like this past summer i hiked the appalachian trail it was amazing. <0> Oh cool! How long was it? Did you go by yourself? <1> It took me a while to do so but I went about 3 years ago and I would love to go back. 
<0> I go to the San Diego Comic-Con every year. <1> It looks rather fun! I've never been to a comic-con. Do you dress up? <0> Yes its a four-day event so I usually only dress up for the first day. <1> That's cool! Do you know any interesting facts about that comic-con? <0> Since 1974, Comic-Con has bestowed its annual Inkpot Award on guests and persons. Its quite cool if you receive one. <1> I didn't really they've been having them that long. Although, I don't know much about them to begin with <0>  Comic-Con International also produces two other conventions, including WonderCon. Have you heard of that? <1> No, I haven't. What is that?
<0> I lied to my friend about something and told her something was okay when it really wasn't <1> Oh. I know lying is sometimes beneficial in some situations. Hopefully you did this to protect someone's feelings <0> I just felt really bad and guilty that I did it. <1> Yeah,  I think that means you have a conscience,  which is a good thing. If you didn't feel bad,  I'd worry about you!
<0> really ? can you get me a job . i am abd . <1> what is your course of study ? i can find out . <0> Computer Science. I'd really like to be a programmer. <1> I work in the Engineering Department at Westmount community College, they are always looking for IT. Send me your resume <0> What kind of engineering do you do? <1> I'm a professor in Mechanical Engineering, so we use a lot of computer models for our work. <0> I've always been interested in Mechanical Engineering, but I don't have the mind for the math <1> I could say the same thing about computer programming, that is a foreign language to me. <0> I can understand that. Have you made any real cool machines? I see a lot of them online. <1> We make a lot of tools for third world countries. Water pumps, etc... <0> There's always work to be done there. Some of the best job security you could ask for. <1> Yeah the job security is nice, but helping out others is the true reward. <0> That's a very good point. Do you do any charity work?
<0> He died in a motor accident <1> I'm sorry to hear that. That's an awful way to go. <0> Seriously it was heartbreaking because we were best of friends <1> Hopefully you're able to move on and be happy. <0> We were not friends, so Im sure I will get over it soon.
<0> and then i heard they just discovered volcanoes under antarctica as well <1> i will have to tell my mom that , she's touring there in the fall . <0> My mom really hates the cold. <1> I am from Chicago - it is really cold here - so she wouldn't like it <0> Chicago has great pizza <1> Yes - chicago style pizza is really popular <0> I have been there a few times <1> I went to the Oprah show once in Chicago - it was really fun - she is amazing. <0> I used to be a musician and played once in Chicago  <1> wow - what instrument do you play? <0> I play drums, it was fun playing in Chicago.
<0> Right now I have bright purple hair! <1> Nice! Did you change your hair color by dyeing it? <0> Yes, I had it professionally done. <1> I know that you can do it at home independently. Have you tried that before? <0> I have done that in the past but I didn't want to mess it up. <1> That makes sense. Did you have a specific reason for dyeing your hair? I know people do it to cover gray or white hair. or to just make their hair more fashionable. <0> I was tired of the same old blonde. <1> Haha sounds like you needed a change! Hair coloring is very popular in Copenhagen. 75 percent of female and 18 percent of men have dyed their hair before.
<0> The most common food that is baked is bread, but I love to bake sweeter items. I just made brownies today for my son's birthday, and I plan to make a big chocolate cake for him on Saturday. What is your favorite kind of cake? <1> Oh I love baking as well!  I love anything chocolate!   <0> Cocao has been cultivated by many cultures for at least three millennia. It comes from a form of bean, which basically means it's a vegetable...right?  <1> hey I will take it!  beans are on my diet so that means chocolate would be on my diet.  Actually i am allowed dark chocolate on my diet.  Which I love! <0> I typically like dark chocolate, but once I get above 60% cocoa it starts to get too bitter for me. Do you prefer milk chocolate or dark chocolate when you have the choice? <1> I prefer dark actually.  I just made some low carb dark chocolate brownies!!  Yummy! <0> Ooo! How do you make them low carb? I've heard of people using things like applesauce and vegetables in their brownies to help make them "healthier." Have you ever tried that? If so, could you tell a difference? <1> I didn't use any flour in these.  Just eggs ,butter ,chocolate, stevia, vanilla, cocoa powder.  I typically use almond flour though when I make baked goods low carb <0> Interesting. So how do you actually get the bready texture if there's no flour? Does the cocoa powder act as a substitute? Or does it come out more like a fudge?
<0> good afternoon , how are you today ? <1> i am 56 years old and amazing . i am female and living it up . <0> i am a 61 year old gym teacher <1> do you like the world . i am trying to take it over . <0> it is a hard world , in my childhood we were poor , now i volunteer <1> i paint in my free time because my family will not visit . <0> that is sad . in my free time i enjoy war documentaries . <1> i think the mona lisa is cool art <0> yes it is nice . what is your favorite food ? mine is cheeseburgers . <1> i clean houses all day . people can be dirty . <0> so true , being a gym teacher i can attest to how people can and be dirty . <1> i like raw steak and eggs . bring on the bacon . <0> Wow, is it safe to eat raw steak?
<0> Oh I love to watch people salsa but have no idea how to do it myself <1> You know, it's actually not as old as people may think. It, along with Salsa music, comes from 1970s New York, with origins from the Puerto Rican bomba and plena, Cuban Son, cha-cha-cha, mambo, and others. So, it's kind of an amalgamation. <0> That's really interesting, does this mean you're an expert? <1> I'm not an expert in Salsa.  I like to watch it but I have no rhythm at all.  Do you like to dance? <0> I'm not very good, but I do find it's a good way to meet new people! <1> What type of dancing do you do?  Have you ever tried Salsa? <0> I tried it once, but my hips just aren't up to it! I prefer Swing dancing - how about yourself? <1> Swing looks fun too!  I like watching lol, but if I had to pick anything it would probably be swing as well. <0> Yeah it is really fun, although I'm really a bit too tall for that style of dancing - lots of crouching required! <1> You just need to find a taller dance partner, that might help a little anyway. <0> Very true, although honestly I'd prefer a night in with pizza and beer... <1> Yeah, I agree.  I would drink some beer, eat some pizza, and make some comics...that would be a perfect night to me.
<0> how are you doing today <1> i am good ! grading papers all day , you ? <0> i'm alright just recording <1> what are you recording ? that sounds interesting . <0> music in my studio my kids like it <1> do you like the band up ? i saw them once . <0> Never heard of the band, Up.
<0> Hello! I am considered obese, I currently eat a lot and weight 340 pounds. <1> Oh i'm sorry. I've been watching the biggest loser <0> Yes it's been a great motivation for me, it made me want to exercise but  I am too lazy. <1> Same here. But with warmer weather coming, I might <0> Yes me too. Not to go to the beach, but simply because warm weather is hard on my body. <1> Oh I enjoy the beach, like to tan <0> I enjoy getting some sun on cooler days, but I mostly tan at home since I am too ashamed to go shirtless in public. <1> That's understandable. Do you eat healthy

Hershey bars, and twix are my favorite <1> I like both of them , I like M&M's to I think they are my favorite  <0> I really like the M&Ms with the pretzels in the center. Salty and Sweet.  <1> Yes they are really good , I ll have to get some this weekend , I like different kinds of chips to you have a favorite chip <0> Blue Doritos are my go to. What is yours? <1> I like the honey mustard chips sweet tasting , they are my favorite. <0> I haven't ever had those. They sound good though <1> I think the owl company makes them they are new only cost a 1.00 for a pretty good size bag 
<0> I got really drunk on my birthday and was horrible to one of my oldest friends,  i felt awful <1> did you apologise to him? maybe next time try to not drink a lot so you can control yourself?
<0> i do enjoy crafting too ! <1> i like to make wreaths , wine glasses , shirts and more . you ? <0> A bit of painting in my spare time. <1> what kind of painting? I do digital art myself <0> Nice. I'm into oil portraiture, takes an age to dry but fun painting outdoors! <1> are you doing commissions or selling, or just as a hobby? <0> Just a hobby. My job is singing - barbershop and rap. What do you do? <1> Quite the combo. I'm trying to make in comics, but its tough <0> Yeah, I can imagine. Have you niche? Comics are super popular now with all the Marvel films.
<0> Red is such a versatile color, it's on one of end of the spectrum alongside orange. <1> I LIKE THE COLOR RED <0> So do I, especially how it has a dominant wavelength of about 625-740 nanometers. <1> THAT IS SO TRUE MY SON THINKS I AM NUTS I BOTH ALOT OF STUFF THAT IS RE <0> That makes sense, its a primary color which is one reason that he is so popular. <1> THAT IS WHAT I SAY <0> It's an even more beautiful color when you see the red sunset, which is caused by the Rayleigh scattering. <1> I LOVE TO WATCH THE SUN SET SO BEAUIFUL
<0> Hello!  Alien invasions are  interesting in science fiction movies. <1> yes, they keep us entertained while watching fiction movies <0> Science fictions movies have been entertaining audiences since the 1960's. <1> i agree, they have been my favorite types of movies to watch <0> Sadly, Mystery Science Theatre 3000 was not a hit. <1> what is Mystery Science Theatre 3000 about? <0> Mystery Science Theatre has a 60-episode syndication that was produced in 1995.  You'll have to check it out! <1> I am not interested in science fiction movies.

<0> I want to learn how to program computers, so I can find more work. <1> Hey me too! I've done some programming in C++ in the past, but am now trying to learn Python.  <0> I know a bit about C++ but what is Python? Is it similar? <1> Well Python is object oriented in the same way that C++ is. But my impression of Python is that it is easier to use, but less efficient (in use of computer resources) to run. <0> I see. My brother is a 3D programmer and uses C++ for his work. So, Python is not as versatile? I remember when I first learned how to write and use a function.
<0> cool , i've a moped , its chill to drive <1> where are you from now ? <0> I'm from Texas. How about you? <1> i'm from mississippi . just moved back here from austin texas <0> Ahh! You must of seen moped's around Austin. I would imagine it would be an easy way to get around for college kids. <1> I remember seeing some on the street that just looked like motorized bikes. <0> My oldest son is in College and he wants an electric scooter to get to classes on the other side of campus. What made you leave Austin? <1> I just wanted to be closer to my family back home, and I wasn't a big fan of Texas honestly.
<0> Were you aware that a baker is someone who bakes and sells bread and related products? <1> I did know that yes! Do you know a lot about bakers? <0> Yes, baking is very old because grains have been used for millenia. <1> Thats cool, What else do you know about baking? <0> Well using yeast is only a recent thing. <1> How recent?

<0> Have you ever been to San Diego Comic-Con? <1> No, but I know that San Diego Comic-Con International is a multi-genre entertainment  <0> I've never been either but it looks like a lot of fun! <1> Oh yes, it was even founded as the Golden state comic book convention <0> Yeah that makes sense. I think it's evolved into gaming and TV shows too. <1> Yes, I also know that it is a four day event during the Summer <0> Yeah and people really wear some elaborate costumes! <1> Exactly, it is commonly known simply as Comic-con
<0> I am sure I will do well on my test tomorrow. Wish me luck. <1> Good luck. What is the class? <0> It's music theory. I love the product but the whole theory thing is a struggle for me. <1> Is that a hard class? what is the idea of the class? <0> It's not so much difficult as it is tedious. It's basically the rules of music. It's a lot of term memorization and whatnot. <1> Oh wow ive never heard of the class but it sounds interesting. I love music but never had a in dept look into it <0> It is very interesting. I think I would find it more interesting if it wasn't such an early class!

<0> I am a men and i struggle with my family because i want to have long hair and they dont let me, i have pretty brown hair! <1> Long hair in some cultures is associated with being free from societies control.  <0> Actually yes i like to feel free! im straight one of my concersn also is if girls will like me with long hair <1> Well long hair is usually rated as attractive by both men and women. <0> That's true. I'm glad I spoke to you, you really made me comfortable with my choice.
<0> The lady accused me of being at fault for not honking my horn! <1> Oh no, was anoyone hurt? <0> No, thankfully not. It turned out OK. <1> I'm glad no one was hurt, I hope the repairs weren't too expensive <0> No, they weren't and I must say I am also glad the woman was OK. I understand her concern. <1> I'm glad she was okay too. Maybe in the future she will pay more attention before backing out. <0> Yes, I hope everyone learned something. It won't stop me from continuing to bike, as I do love it so. <1> Was her car red by any chance? That's my favorite color. I want a red car. <0> No, it was blue, but my bike is red. I love red also and once owned a red car, so I know you'd love one. <1> No, I'm not into red cars.
<0> Do you like fair rides? I can't take them myself. <1> I don't like them at all. I've seen too many videos on the internet where people get injured or they break easily <0> Yes,  I remember in 2007 a teen was decapitated at Six Flags in Atlanta. <1> Yeah that is terrifying. The smaller country fairs are worse. I bet they have no one really checking up on them except the carney folk. <0> I just don't think they're safe enough,  many rides at the small carnivals are rickety and wobbly.
<0> i do enjoy crafting too ! <1> i like to make wreaths , wine glasses , shirts and more . you ? <0> A bit of painting in my spare time. <1> what kind of painting? I do digital art myself <0> Nice. I'm into oil portraiture, takes an age to dry but fun painting outdoors!
<0> Everyday i buy my dog some dog biscuits, he loves them! <1> How do dogs eat those things?  they are so dry and hard!  What possible benefit could they get from them, other than taste, which apparently they do like. <0> Well some of them have vitamins, and they nibble on them slowly, the taste is sometimes so great that i try one :D do you have a dog? <1> Yes, I have a dingo, which is a type of feral dog from Australia.  Have you heard of them?   <0> Yes they seem nice, i have a Pekingese, but he is black not so ugly as the brown ones, he haves white paws <1> Oh, i see.  great dog, but probably poos everywhere. don't they cross them with other breeds to make peekapoos or peke-a-tese? <0> Yes they do, but i dont like Pekingese, or peekapoos, i got it from a shelter so i was ok with him :D now my mother takes care of it :D <1> probably a good choice for your mother, since they are docile companion animals.  That's why they call them Lap-dogs. <0> Exactly im too young for that kind of a dog, but i sure like them dog biscuits :D <1> Lap dogs are bad dogs.
<0> i'm from chicago , illinois but i now live in wisconsin . <1> so when do you think you will open one ? <0> I didn't decide it yet you know <1>  I wish I could help with you with your labels for your products but did Steph tell you, I have been colorblind since I was born. <0> Sorry to know that, but can you see some colors or just all black and white? <1> just black and white, and greys of course. That is why I am only a volunteer firefighter, because I didn't meet regulations. <0> That's really brave of you, some people wouldn't do that, not like me <1> what do you do?
<0> I have a confession; I color my hair to cover the gray that keeps popping up. <1> How old are you? That's fair, I'd probably do the same. <0> I'm 47, so with age comes increasing gray, I know.  However, I am very young at heart. <1> Age is just a number, my friend. Your body just wants to tell you otherwise. <0> I'm just going to say it; I like you.  You seem very wise and practical. <1> Why thank you. I'm not old enough to be wise though, honestly haha. <0> Age has little to do with wisdom.  Thoreau discussed the error of respecting the aged, just because they were older.  Wisdom can manifest itself in anyone. <1> That's very interesting, I'd like to think that I have a fair amount of it then/ <0> I'd say you did.  Have you ever read Walden?  It's message of self-reliance and personal independence might resonate with a thoughtful mind like yours. <1> Yes I have. It's an interesting read.
<0> hi , how are you doing today ? <1> great just finished watching a documentary with my husband <0> i'm a teacher ! love documentaries ! what was it about ? <1> me too ! they're my favorite . was watching taxi to the dark side <0> i've never seen that . i will have to check it out . <1> it is very well made , i usually read a lot but love documentaries <0> i like gardening and anything outdoors ! <1> i am pregnant first timeso have been stuck at home myself <0> that's exciting ! do you go to church ? <1> i do , me and my husband both go to bible study every wednesday <0> i attend every week as well . just got home from church . <1> are you married as well ? what part of the country you from ? <0> I am married and from the south.  What kind of church do you go to?
<0> Have you ever worked at a day care? Childcare is generally given to kids ages 6 weeks to 13 years. <1> i have not and was not in it growing up either <0> Well child care is very important in developing a child's emotional and social development, <1> In 2011, the median annual salary for a child care worker was $19,430, less than a parking lot attendant or a janitor. <0> That is not a very good salary and probably representative of the gender pay gap in the U.S. <1> i think it has to do with the fact that its an unskilled job, but things have changed so much, Fewer than one-in-three children today have a full-time, stay-at-home parent. In 1975, only a generation ago, more than half of all children had a stay-at-home parent
<0> hi how are you this afternoon <1> very good and how are you doin ? <0> good tired from walking dogs early in the morning ! <1> that's always tiring , have dogs myself <0> oh wow how many ? i have three <1> wow i have two dogs and one cat <0> cool well if you ever need them walked i have a dog walking business <1> i will keep that in mind , you have any brothers or sisters <0> no my dad was to busy traveling to give me a sibling <1> only child , i've 4 siblings one brother three sisters <0> that is a lot i wish i had a sibling . are you guys close ? <1> yeah mostly especially with my brother <0> do you watch sports together ? <1> Yes, sometimes we watch football together.
<0> I don't think I was ever considered extreme - those people are amazing and I don't understand how they do it.   <1> I am not sure how they are so good at it, I watch "Extreme Couponing" all the time on TLC <0> I love that show, people are funny. <1> odd that a show like that is so popular <0> Yeah, anything for entertainment though right? <1> agreed <0> What do you do? <1> work at a university <0> do you lecture in the university
<0> I love the color red,red is the color at the end of the visible spectrum of light <1> I love red too! Red is my favorite color! <0> Mars is red and its Iron Oxide that gives the red color to the planet <1> I did not know that, that is really cool. What else do you know about red. <0> The color of blood comes from the protein hemoglobin while red leaves get their color from anthocyanins <1> Is that true for leaves that are always red, or just ones that turn red in autumn?
<0> Yes, I have heard of it but do not know much about it.  What movies  have they produced? <1> I'm not too sure, but I know some stars that became big from this studio, like Rosalind Russell and Glenn Ford. <0> That's true! My brother in law runs a major hollywood studio - I only know information about his. Do you have a favorite type of movie?  <1> I really like comedies if they're well done, but a lot of them leave me wanting more. Dramas are good. <0> Oh, comedies are my favorite, too! Some are cheesy though. What's your favorite? <1> My favorite comedy is Step Brothers with Will Farrell. What is your favorite film? <0>  Oh, I like that one! My favorite is This is The End with James Franco. James Franco is my favorite actor. <1> Sometimes people say I look like James Franco! Have you seen Caddyshack? <0> James Franco is great, what a compliment! I actually haven't seen Caddyshack. Is it a comedy too? <1> Yeah it is, It has Bill Murray in it and it's a true gem. <0> I will have to look it up! The world needs more laughs these days. What do you do for a living?
<0> sometimes , but i do like swimming in pool and running . <1> i prefer not to do stuff like that , but i do like traveling . <0> where is the last place you traveled? <1> I went to Canada. It is my favorite place to travel. Have you been somewhere fun?
<0> A friend of mine drove me to work when my car broke down <1> That is great of them,  did you do anything to pay them back?
<0> I'm actually attending law school to become an attorney. <1> Wow! That's awesome. Are you trying to get your Juris Doctor degree? <0> No I want to become a lawyer. <1> We have 3 lawyers in our family. <0> That cool. At if you get in trouble you can get some help. <1> No doubt.  My twin brother is a doctor.  Parents are very happy. <0> That nice. You like mysteries books. <1> Nah.  I'm more of a romance book nerd.
<0> do you ever feel lonely? i do. i hate my own company and i have no friends. <1> Same. I hate my life. I sit in front of my computer all day
<0> I've been looking into different hair colorings to mask my grey, but I'm worried about if they're dangerous. Help! <1> I dont think its dangerous, hair dyeing with enough practice is good if done on other people to change their hair color.rather than yours.  <0> Might be a little hard to get volunteers for me practicing hair coloring. Seen any teenage scene girls lately? They might be willing, lol. <1> Well you can always have it done by a professionally hairdresser or at home by someone else who has done it before.  <0> Professional hairdresser might be the best idea. Should I go with a conventional hair color, or something wild and fun? <1> Something fun sounds great, you want to look your best for the guys. just use one bottle and dont over do it or you will ruin the color!  <0> Use three bottles to make sure it sticks, got it. I could always bleach it, right? That could be exciting! <1> Well if your hair is blond, then you shouldnt bleach it, Just wash it really good and choose a darker color. You dont want to ruin your hair roots.  
<0> I love red. It reminds me roses and weddings. What about you? <1> Red is a great color. It is one of the primary colors on the RGB color model. <0> I see, do you know its wavelength?  <1> I do actually. Red has a dominant wavelength of 625-740 nonometres. <0> Wow, you know a lot about colors
<0> hi there , how are you <1> i'm good . how are you ? <0> i am pretty good . tell me about yourself ? <1> well , i love shopping and pampering myself . i go to the spa a lot ! <0> sounds like fun . i personally like watching nascar racing and ufc <1> i don't watch much television , but i love music . britney spears is my favorite . <0> britney spears is good but not my favorite , aerosmith is . <1> that's cool . what is your favorite food ? <0> mexican food is my favorite , whats yours ?
<0> retired , but run a side business in computer programming which was my trade . <1> nice , i can not wait until i can retire . i'm also a hair stylist . <0> I like being retired, but I miss working, too. <1> It has to be nice to have more free time though. I live on a boat and plan to take it everywhere once I retire. <0> I miss going somewhere and being productive. It's hard to do when you don't have to. <1> yeah , that is true . i've a real passion for computer programming . <0> What do you love about it? <1> I just love learning new things and there is always something new to learn in programming. <0> What do you do in your free time?
<0> After working for years at a job I didn't like,  and struggling in school,  I found a new job that coincides with my Major. <1> I am so happy for you! All of your hard work paid off! <0> Thanks! For the first time in a long time,  the future isn't looking so dark. <1> That is great accomplishment! I wish you well on your new path in life! <0> My path doesn't seem to be leading anywhere, I have no hope for the future.
<0> i work from home , what about you ? <1> i love animals and the outdoors , so i work at the zoo . <0> Oh no way. What animals do you help with? <1> Any kind that needs help and happens to fall on my doorstep. I even feed all the wild critters I can :) <0> What's one of the most unique? <1> seals , sea lions and walruses come to mind . can you think of any ? <0> That's so cool. I've never seen one in person  <1> Don't club any seals :)
<0> My friends and I had spent all day troubleshooting a new PC build that we had just completed. <1> That sounds intensive! How did it go? <0> It went awful. It turned out that the motherboard or processor were defective and we had to deconstruct it to return both pieces. So much wasted time! <1> I bet that was so defeating! I'm sorry to hear that. I wish there was better quality control with some of these companies that deal in parts.
<0> i draw first usually . then paint <1> do you like tea ? i like tea when i'm trying to be creative <0> tea in the afternoon is my favourite <1> I love tea after my dinner.

<0> I really miss my dog who passed away. <1> That sucks,  I love dogs. <0> Me too. She is a better place now. <1> Yes I am sure she it. <0> We're holding a dog funeral for her on Saturday, if you would like to come.
<0> I would love to take a wine tasting course. <1> Wine tasting has been around since the 14th century.  I really love wine so a wine tasting course would be fun. <0> I love wine too!  I remember doing some wine tasting when I visited Napa, but I would like to learn more about different wines <1> One of my favorite types of wine is cabernet sauvignon.  Which is one of the most popular and recognized red varietals. <0> What about Merlot?, could you tell me what is different about it? <1> Merlot is deemed to be "softer" and "fleshy" than cabernet which is usually smokier and deeper. <0> What about the whites what is the difference between a Pinot Griggio and a Sauvignon? <1> I'm not too versed on whites.  I do know that another popular variety of red is pinot noir, and the grapes are grown in cooler locations. <0> I have also heard about Tempranillo, even when I haven't tried it?  What do you think about it? <1> I think it is very good, from what I have tasted.

<0> I'm going skydiving this weekend. I'm afraid of heights and freaking out a little. <1> Oh my! That sounds exciting for sure! I couldn't do it,  I don't think. <0> Yea,  until this morning when I called and put down a deposit I did not think I could either. <1> Have you ever done anything else so frightening? <0> Yes,  I love doing something crazy and the feeling I get from it.  <1> I would say that you're an adventurous person. Me,  I'm more laid back and mellow. Kudos to you and have fun! <0> Thank you. I wish you can follow me one day.
<0> I feel something when I think back to where I came from. It makes me feel a bit nostalgic <1> Feeling nostalgic can be great. Where are you from? <0> I'm from India. Where are you from? <1> I'm an American and live in washington. I do love eating Indian food though. <0> That's cool. I always wanted to visit NY <1> You should. I've been a few times and loved it. Thats where I bought my parakeet in pet shop in New York. Do you have any pets? <0> No, But I lovee dogs <1> I love dogs myself but not ready for one yet, maybe in a few years time.  <0> No, They do it purposely  <1> I actually wish i could rescue all of those dogs in the world so no dog dies, don't you? <0> Mine is Red, What's yours
<0> My sister just got a huge promotion and her husband bought her a new house. <1> Congrats.  They must be excited. <0> Oh yeah they are. Finally after years of hard work they have a place they own. <1> Ever thought about traveling to celebrate such occasion? Maybe you can join me to see the pyramids. <0> Seems like a strange thing to ask. But no, I personally cannot afford to go on big trips out of the country. <1> That's fair. How close are you with your sister? <0> Were pretty close, I talk to her a few times a month but she lives out of state so. <1> Oh. Perhaps you can go visit her and visit that new place. Does their new place have a pool? <0> Yeah, I might go sometime in a few months when I save up some cash, No theres no pool but its really close to some cool hiking trails <1> Oh nice. Yes traveling cost must be quite hefty. Are you into hiking?  <0> Yes! I really enjoy hiking, spending hours in nature.
<0> I expected a hike in my package. <1> A hike in your package? I'm sorry, I don't follow. As in how long it would take to get there to you? <0> oh, i'm doing a package tour <1> So, there's no hike included at all? <0> I'm hope so, probably as an additional excursion.  <1> Yah, more money, right?  I can't imagine being gone for that long.  My cats would miss me. <0> Always more money lol. If you wanted to travel, could a trusted person look after the cats? <1> Yes of course.
<0> Have you ever been to a wine tasting? <1> no, not really a fan of wine, but my wife loves wine. <0> The Paris Wine Tasting of 1976 is when it started I think. <1> cool. how many different kinds of wine are there? <0> I asm not sure but I know white wine is one of them. <1> how long does it take for wine to mature? <0> I am not sure but I know its from the Latin vinum. <1> what else can you tell me about it? <0> The different types of grapes produce different styles of wine. <1> I know a lot
<0> I worked really hard on this project for work and it totally bombed. <1> Awe,  sorry to hear that. I am sure you did better than you think.
<0> I finished a major work assignment in a short amount of time <1> Oh really what was the assignment
<0> My granddad means so much to me I still wear his necklace even though he passed. <1> I am sorry for your loss,  at least you got some time together <0> Yes and thank you I know he is close in spirit I get emotional sometimes but the memories we had was great. <1> I feel that way about my grandma,  it is sad that by the time we are born they are so old <0> My granddad was a cantankerous old man and I really didn't like him
<0> Dangit!  They burned!! <1> Are you baking? What did you burn. <0> My brownies! Ugh, the kitchen smells horrible now haha <1> Oh no! Do you burn foods often? <0> No, hardly ever! I'm a great cook but not the best at baking. Maybe I should just stick to writing. Aspiring journalist here <1> Very lucrative career. What do you write about? <0> Generally politics. I am fascinated by what motivates politicians to do the outlandish things they do.
<0> its going well . spent the day outside . do you have any pets ? <1> no . . i have kids though <0> Those are way harder to deal with than pets. <1> Yes they are sometime, but they are useful right now. <0> How so? <1> I am in a wheel chair, so they help me get around town. <0> Oh yes, I'm sure they are very helpful right now.  Someday I will probably wish I got along with people better than animals. <1> You are not a social type of person? <0> Not really.  I find it hard to relate to people. <1> Some people are pretty cool when you start knowing them. <0> i just went to a big party yesterday it was a lot of fun.
<0> It took a long time to do it due to a lot of hardships in life, but my wife finally graduated from a masters program over the Summer. <1> Wow, wat is her degree in? <0> Anthropology. I know nothing about it.  <1> I see. Anthropology is broadly, the study of man. The term was coined in the Renaissance. <0> Yes. She may go into phycology. She enjoys human behavior studies.   <1> yeah sure. Anthropology is a great choice
