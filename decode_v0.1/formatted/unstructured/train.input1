<1> I have 2 dogs, no cats.
<0> I hope the Republicans win.
<0> no, have you?
<1> You are smart to worry.  You should worry alot because there's a lot that could go wrong.
<0> You are right, Iphones are slower and I hate Androids too.
<0> well , in summer i actually like to go to the county fairs around my area . you ?
<0> i am in school for magic
<0> The mustache  dates back to 2550 BC
<1> I do no believe males feel protective to distant family members.  
<0> Oh I love games with alternative endings too.  You can play it over and over again
<1> Yeah, well you don't have to work there. I hate it there.
<0> I won't do any buying online.
<0> pineapple turnover cake! Gonna pimp it up with cherries.
<1> That's sad. I think the best option is to start as a friend.
<0> It is very interesting! I hope to work here for the rest of my career!
<1> You are lucky to have a nice dad.
<0> Yes several cuisines around the world sell my food, but its most popular in US.
<0> Lol,  I was. But that didn't help me much when I walked into work with torn pants. They had to send me home after all that!
<1> Yea exactly. Any plans on restoring another car ?
<1> beautiful . is that okay ? do not tell me wife
<0> Oh man I dont know. I feel awkward. Maybe Ill go back next week and make a joke about it.
<0> no dogs here i love my three cat !
<0> You're right!  And there's so many different ways of loving that are becoming socially accepted, like polyamory-- so much more than just two partners!
<0> Are you going to continue to take lessons?
<1> I know Indians use to have long hair
<1> no i dont like dogs and duck hunting
<0> Ok. My wife needs to be strict with the kids, I don't want a foster care situation
<0> I wonder if dogs would say the same thing. if they could walk in our shoes 
<0> That's so thoughtful of you to say!  Made my day brighter!
<0> no it was a brief moment . we are good friends
<0> We try make that quality positive.
<0> i like the rolling stones
<0> I don't remember any particular model, but most brands have their convertible version. 
<0> i do not like soccer nor do i like beach. I like to be left alone 
<0> i really love concerts too
<0> no thats fine for now
<0> i work at a lawyers office .
<0> I like to think so. It just makes me feel a little better. Its like having him right there with me.
<0> Yeah my GPA was pretty solid in high school.
<1> Yes I have two cats but I don't have any dogs. 
<0> Just working on a deck-building roguelike at the moment. Simple and something I can do on my own.
<0> There are some very good restaurants in the area
<0> I don't think Westworld will continue though because I heard HBO has less than 20 million subscribers
<0> you seem nice . any advice for future animator slash author ? you married ?
<0> the yellow labs , they give me advice on seafood allergies .
<1> No, they're not that rare though, so it would be soon i think
<0> That's so funny that you would say that, I have long blonde hair too, down to my knees!!
<1> Oh that's cool. I'm not a fan of teaching personally. I work an office job instead. 
<1> really, they are so overrated 
<0> The French like an anise like flavor of vanilla, but I much prefer the more standard vanilla flavoring.
<1> I don't know about that, I barely make enough hours to qualify for part-time.  
<1> sleeping early is good 
<1> I never eat breakfast. I dont know how to cook.
<0> I'll just go get it. I live just down the street.
<1> I don't have a dog.
<1> i have to agree with you on that one for sure !
<0> i hated being 20
<1> It’s a good album, but it’s only good for relaxing to.
<0> Well it sounds like I will be working really long hours without getting paid overtime. It doesnt seem like the salary offered will be worth the amount of time I will be at the office.
<0> why would i eat the old testament ? that's kinky
<1> i'm really excited . what kind of a parrot is burt ?
<0> The company have done well since the founder Kiichiro Toyoda  started the company in 1937,
<1> I own a garage. Cars are my passion.
<0> yeah i play piano and some bass guitar
<1> I doubt it, nobody is hiring these days.
<1> Nah. we don't have any poisonous flowers  
<0> are . you . serious ? i am so impressed
<0> I guess it was a good thing we weren't all that close to Callie. Pain in the ass, that cat.
<0> i have played the guitar since i was little.
<0> Okay, could have been better 
<1> i agree, but i create time for them 
<0> the real flashy ones because i do d models .
<1> A cruise to St. Thomas.  It was relaxing because it wasn't during hurricane season.  What about you?
<0> Not particularly, I can't say i've came across a topic that really intrigues me.
<1> Yeah, right? My job is very interesting too. I am quite passionate about it.
<0> Wow you know a lot do you cook breakfast often. I love to infuse it in to other dishes as well.
<0> Not right now, i used to have one. If you could own a wild animal what would it be?
<0> I have faith he will. He is a good person.
<0> Aww! True that! They may end up being best friends.
<0> I've never been swimming before.
<1> i prefer someone else to cook me dinner . whats his job ?
<0> it is supposed to be half a million,  a sewage pipe busted over me while i was in a store
<0> The world is full of sin, my friend.  That's why I never attend church.
<0> Omar was his name
<0> Yeah,  well wait until you hear this! Her husband agreed that she needed to go help her mom,  and then he filed for divorce!
<1> i am doing okay . just eating some chocolate , watching anime !
<0> that's true but i really love my job so i cant even think about retiring early 
<0> hi ! i've a boring profession in an office what about you ?
<1> No  i cannot  play on that because i do no have passion for it . It takes enough of breath 
<1> i do not even own a tv , but i fell you
<0> No, but I'd really like to get a purple one some day
<1> I have been bungee jumping before, it is such a thrill!
<1> I don't play any instruments. I don't enjoy listening to music.
<1> I loved it there, the dry heat in the desert is the best. 
<0> They seem to be making genuine progress.
<0> Thank you. I prefer dogs, but I do own both. How about you?
<1> The video to what?
<0> no. whenever we meet i will handover to him
<1> People had better avoid the championship and restaurants and bars. It is too dangerous during the pandemic to have such a tournament. 
<1> Hope you have fun! Never been there myself, I'll have to do it one day.
<0> Yeah, I hate cats. I'll never ever have a pet cat.
<0> It's quite a balancing act!  I do need to use props to make them sturdy.  Interestingly, it was in the 17th century that cake decorating began!
<0> Yeah it did star Jodie Foster, do you like any of her other movies?
<0> I love Blues. Have you listened to this genre before? 
<0> I only like summer sports, nothing from the winter games. Snowboarding is my least favorite activity.
<1> Not really, it's too sweet for me. 
<1> mines an iphone 
<0> Yes, but I have never cursed in my life.
<0> Well it would be a shame to not bring up Freddy Mercury if we are talking about people with amazing voice ranges and a distinctive voice the man is also a legend! What's your favourite Rolling Stones album and song?
<1> Oh, my favorite is classical.
<0> No, I hate NFL Madden, video games are a waste of time.
<0> Come on. I love my stomach.
<1> Uh oh...Was it tainted? I wouldn't risk it...
<0> Thanks, I am not worried about getting it. I think I'll get it.
<0> ASUS. I've had a good luck streak with them that I hope will continue
<0> sounds like you will be. Messi is my favorite player. Who is yours?
<1> I understand. You should be ashame of yourself.
<0> ahh i love exercise, i am regularly exercising and keeping fit
<0> yep it sucked quite a bit
<0> The were unconventional and played many genres, including pop music, Indian music, and hard rock!
<0> They have muscular and slender body.  They are cuter than other types of cats, I think.
<0> I really hate the noise and insanity of the day time.
<0> I'm not going to a drag show. I'm going to a drag race.
<0> Not eve. I really wish it were me that won. 
<0> you have been lucky then . not many people have that luxury .
<0> That is a great choice,  I love mine so so much
<0> I mean, it's kind of slow to I think most of us nowadays.  It was black and white.  But it managed to snag 9 Oscar nominations.
<0> Looked like it hurt when it hit the door at full speed.
<1> Bitten by what? I don't have pets.
<0> Pretty terrible. Feeling pretty down and been in a bad place for a while lately
<0> In Australia there is a thing called a bushwalk and its basically just walking through the desert!
<1> Yes, one of the earliest shops was started by the Wolverhampton Society for the Blind to help raise money for the Society!
<0> That's fantastic! How often do you drive it? I drive my truck around every morning for fun. 
<1> That sounds nice. I hate Asian food but at least it's cheap.
<0> It is named after a small maneuverable warship called a corvette
<0> yeah, but I'm not sure I will get it.
<0> I should probably get out and get some exercise with a sport like that soon; it'll make up for the fast food I got after my dog came back.
<1> Oh wow! I like getting out of my comfort zone and doing new things,  it's such a thrill. Especially rock climbing - I had a friend who made me do it once too
<1> Lol maybe
<0> I was very happy for sure
<1> do not tell my students , but i sing karaoke on friday nights !
<0> yeah I like chicken but hate mac and cheese
<0> I was diagnosed earlier this year. It's such a pain.
<0> I would like to own an suv someday.
<0> thanks alot. wow
<1> I don't enjoy their music much.
<1> Only 10%? That's pretty good odds.
<1> Well, it makes sense, being fully prepared is not best if you are really hoping to get the job.
<0> I see. I genuinely think this is a bad step. I'd rather they keep it prohibited.
<1> i like fishing too
<0> Milky Way actually means Milky Circle in latin
<0> Apparently in Australia, hitchhikers point at the roads as opposed to thumbs up. I thin I would pass them by in confusion.
<0> Thank you,  I hope yours is great as well
<0> I haven't taken any of the courses before, so I've been looking into it a lot.
<0> yes i live good spiderman. do not live evil
<0> I like reading too, but I can't stand doing anything physical like sports or dancing or hiking.
<0> Yes I'm from there actually
<1> have you read summer in my garden ? i bet you would like it .
<0> I will have to look for some female quartet groups. 
<1> Puppies aren't all they're cracked up to be.
<1> What? I am not fine, don't ask.
<1> Keep in mind much of the state is at or near sea level, so if you are there during hurricane season and one comes, it is best to evacuate if they tell you to.  
<1> When my father lived, he enjoyed taking me fishing as a child as a get away from all of life's problems. Red Fish was our catch.
<1> I can quite easily. I've never used it and probably never iwll.
<1> That's something she should know. 
<0> Me too.  It is the waiting that is the worse part.  It is hard to get your mind off of it.
<0> he played the villain in Lazy town a strange TV show for kids in america
<0> yeah and i was worried so i went out that morning and bought them more candy to replace it
<1> That's interesting, I knew he was an astronomer but not a scientist.
<0> I'm single and don't have kids.
<1> Love the karoke idea - sounds fun.  We play games - cards, jenga, cattan, etc
<0> Thanks for enlightening me about computer engineering
<0> Yes, people would travel for days to get to the fair so they could be sure to meet those they needed to buy from or sell to.
<0> Very. I feel confident in my abilities,  but of course it does play on the nerves some anyway.
<0> I am as well, it's why I've never had one as a pet :(
<1> i don't . they are filthy animals .
<0> i like cooking the pies with nutella i love it
<0> I bought 100 cheeseburgers from McDonald's. I shall eat like a king for the rest of my life!
<1> I've never known any real police officers.  
<1> I've never heard of Bob Marley.  What instrument does he play?
<0> Any metal is nice but I really like any rock too.
<0> They perform anything from classical to repertoire.
<1> I don't need to go to Cinemas as I have my own home theatre and enjoy that.
<0> You've been been to the beach? Wow! Come to Florida as we have the longest coastline in the US!
<1> Of course not.  Elementary schools are boring. 
<0> I will someday go to Canada because I have never been there.
<0> Yah so its like 40 years old
<0> By the way, I got promoted because I was working so hard last week to have that report done and the client really liked my report
<0> Yeah,  you sorta feel like the specialist among your friends and loved ones.
<0> That's not interesting at all.
<0> Well, I would have to pass.  I can't stand pie.
<0> Me too. I have to work all day tomorrow and I dread it.
<0> if its not hiking its cooking love to cook
<1> I lived in Japan for a few years but just moved to Texas yesterday.
<1> yes i like my job so much of doing other jobs
<0> That is one of my biggest pet peeves. Just tell me what your intentions actually are instead of stringing me along for nothing. It would have been more than perfect for my family. I really believed her.
<0> Definitely, their song B.Y.O.B won best hard rock performance of 2006 just to name one.
<0> Montana in the winter! I love cold weather.
<1> according to this not much lol , you ?
<0> Sorry, they just died recently.
<0> It's quite tough, you have to have knowledge in all fields of law including Ethics, Philsoophy of Law, Civil Law, Administrative Law, Consumer Law, and many more!
<0> look at the bright side! soon the robots will take over and we won't be there so no one can hurt anyone anymore.
<1> I've been trying out a dating app, too, to find a potential spouse.
<0> I wish I could just keep cooking, but it doesn't pay the bills!
<0> Maybe but I'm not feeling good
<0> Yes! You should have watched that game. I felt very influenced by France. They played really good.
<0> I would be afraid that the Crocodile would eat my rattle snake.
<0> Well the minimum wage is fine as is there's no use in doing that.
<1> I bet it was really hard but I wouldn't know because I don't smoke. 
<0> Barney (the best friend) was probably my favorite. I liked their kid Pebbles and Bambam too. I'll be searching the web to order these now lol
<0> i believe i cant be tired of that meal
<1> yes . i guess he's kind of my role model .
<1> Very nice, even though I hate living in the United States I still salute your husband.
<1> i cant explain although i heard its a nice place
<0> I made sure to let them know as soon as it happened and send them a picture.... they were a little upset i missed it but understood
<1> I live near the beach. We're always hearing stories of people having to be rescued because they overestimated their abilities.
<0> You will have some soon probably.
<0> wait until you have two daughter and a husband busy busy busy
<0> Stuffed crust and extra cheese is mine!It's the best witha a side of wings!
<0> Basketball can be very fun. It can be very technical from a rules standpoint, though.
<1> I really hate the ones that are so pretty, especially Rarity.
<0> your friend name
<1> Vitamin C is useless.
<1> I don't really care about different kinds of cars. I just want whatever drives well. 
<0> Me to!
<1> No, i am a teacher at my local high school
<0> Are you in the Navy? I've always wondered what that is like.
<1> Actually, the US is one of the healthiest nations.
<1> where to though?
<1> ugh how ridiculous . i just proposed to my girl
<1> Maybe a cruise to nowhere would be good for you.  They are less expensive and only last 2-3 nights.  Could be fun.
<1> I hate birds and anyway I have a pet cat that likes to eat birds.
<0> I agree, I will be cancelling the wedding.
<0> wow i play baseball or used to be a player
<1> Yeah doesn't sound interesting at all.
<0> Yes actually. My favorite colors are white and black so I enjoy painting abstract and contrasting these colors. 
<0> They have been dominate for so long. It now appears they are about to dominate the East for the next 10 years after the departure of Lebron James to the Lakers.
<0> I see, well I need to go flush my beta fish, I killed it, forgot to feed it. Oops!
<0> I'm not sure but the helmet that I have for my motorcycle is pretty good at blocking the sounds anyway.
<0> I agree. I am so thankful
<0> We are a comical group.  I am a sun worshiper too.  I love the beach and sitting by my pool.  
<0> i hate eating sushi i sea food allergy.
<1> Yes, it is a bit small.
<1> this 1 was for the holiday
<0> Ah well, it is a great spring drink. Already ready for winter to pass so I can get to my favourite season!
<0> yes, it is 
<0> It's alright. At least it fits me perfectly. 
<0> Yes, and pit bulls are the most common breed of choice for dog fights.
<0> Aw.. Thank you. I truly appreciate that. Sometimes I think I should have gone first, but then, I know it'd have been harder on him than it is on me.
<1> Oh no, they might harm anyone else but me!
<1> i love my mum.
<0> Hey i'm searching for a job...can you help me to find a good job?
<0> Thanks,  we could use it.
<0> He got me the Lego Disney castle that I have been wanting forever.
<1> really ? that's good . someday i might take up new hobbies .
<0> ah...you ever fly to Buffalo? I'm a huge Bills fan.
<0> A little bit I guess
<1> Yeah I really need to stop planning things at the last minute.
<0> Yeah in addition to producting seed they have long been admired for their beaty
<1> Too bad I'm living with another loser at the moment.
<1> Wow, your family must really not love you at all!!
<1> I have never been to Las Vegas, but my family and I are planning to go next summer. 
<1> He started it in 1986 in East Hanover
<1> I've heard that fear makes people do all sorts of crazy things.
<0> Yes and you can do what you like while listening and watching.
<0> I don't do financial services for the company I work in sales.
<0> No I have to go tomorrow. I feel a deep pain when I am not taking care of them. They definitely expect it! I LOVE making sure all the critters are fed- with how cruel the world is to them- It's the least I can do..also skunks,  bunnies etc at night like to come too. I will go get it tomorrow,  I promise!
<0> its ok i work from home most days and my boyfriend works fulltime
<0> i just follow the regular news and keep updating myself.
<0> Pet ownership is second only to gardening in the U.S. as the most popular hobby. I'd guess the U.S.
<0> Yes, Cheese tastes bad and has a bad smell.
<0> what kind of music do you like
<1> Sounds like good news to me, I really don't like dogs.
<0> That is a short amount of time I would have thought it would have been around way before that being back in the day people was known for making lot's of food at once. 
<0> Thanks, but I am pretty sure there is no way of finding out what is causing my allergies.
<0> Congratulations! Boy or girl? We have 5 and 7 year old boys
<0> Fried chicken with salad.
<1> they are wild and grow everywhere
<0> That's understandable, It's sad but you guys are doing a good job. 
<0> I'd say out of all the types I prefer woodwind instruments.
<1> the piano is great . pets usually eat my food while i cook so no , do you ?
<0> Oh yikes. I love going through old vinyl records at Goodwill. 
<1> I wear glasses from 2 years now.
<0> Wow! Talk about scary! I love to travel,  but I hate flying so much.
<0> did you eat any snacks when you watched it?
<1> i cant testify to the authenticity
<1> You really should - everybody loved the salsa I made, even my mother!
<0> I don't know. I have never eaten fruit cake, and it really sounds gross to me.
<0> I am walking my dog right now. I am not really looking for a job at this time.
<1> Is that also were apple cider comes from?   I really enjoyed drinking that as a kid.
<1> oh that's awesome ! you could give me fresh steak .
<1> I've seen a few of the Spiderman movies, but generally prefer the older ones.
<1> Yeah, I was a really talented artist even as a kid.
<0> I like cats too but I'm allergic to them so I have to go the dog route. What's your favorite breed?
<0> Oh that's awesome. It's healthy and fun! What are your hobbies?
<0> I am,  I feel okay but you never know what might be wrong.
<1> I don't care about that, I always keep everything clean when I work with clay.
<1> i wish i could have studied after i graduated
<0> That's so cool. Some people still have dogs that are closely related to wolves. At least that's what I heard.
<1> What kinds of fields are you interested in?
<0> is orange your favorite color?
<0> cat man that is funny . actually , cats make really good companions .
<0> No,  he did pass away about 9 months after the diagnosis.  I tried to help care for him,  but we had to call hospice in eventually.  There are some angels that work for hospice.
<0> I love musical TV series/movies! I can't sing to save my life, but watching them inspires me. My favorite musical is Rent
<1> I don't like country music. I prefer rock.
<1> Have you ever had a rivalry between a brunette? 
<1> Cool..I want one but never got any..My kids have some
<1> I think so, the 5 years I've spent with my tortoise have been great.
<1> Museums are a waste of money.
<1> None actually, I hate chinese food.
<0> It was an IPhone from 2012. It wasn't that new so it's not a big deal if I can't find it.
<0> Has it been difficult for you to be organized errands with your family while running a business? 
<0> it is only him and i , so i spoil him with vacations .
<0> I like sapphire! I like turquoise more, however. It's closer to teal.
<1> survival is key and everyone looks to survive.  
<1> Please don't try to get even with her
<1> When I was in Mexico, I swam all the time.
<1> that's great ! my favorite color is black , i always wear it . whats yours ?
<0> Thats unfortunate. Family farms are very lucrative. 
<0> I do enjoy rice and noodles. What about you?
<1> yup wanted to start a business but at this point in my life its a bit too risky 
<1> I surf a few times a year if I'm near the ocean.
<1> I'd say ignore them as best as you can. It's normal for kids to do these kind of things!
<0> Actually, I don't like flying. I'm not afraid, but I hate the commercial airline, security, baggage. So tiring. But I am excited to meet some of my nieces and nephews.
<1> So what's the deal
<1> My sister has two cats that live at her house. They are so cute!
<0> Doubtful honestly.. they dont seem to care very much. :/
<1> I know. You sound like you are familiar with LPN works.
<1> Definitely the best.  So, what are you up to right now?
<1> I hope it does. I don't have to worry about that as my family is really wealthy.
<1> I have heard it is but i don't know, i have never tried it
<1> I disagree. Their first album is fantastic!
<0> I was not aware of that! You may have just saved my life because I love eating them raw. I will cook them first from now on.
<0> It's called Ponyo. They've been singing a song from it for the last couple of days.
<1> That's a small province. That may be why they are so endangered. 
<1> No, the beach is awful and terrible because I hate sand, it gets everywhere.
<0> It does sound good, never had that before, I'll have to try it sometime.
<0> oh that's fine. Sheeran's second album "x" got to number 1 in the USA and even UK
<0> I've only had good experiences with McDonald's salads. Always fresh in my opinion.
<1> Oh I hate mini golf. It is such a boring game.
<0> Some become vegetarians for environmental, cultural, or economic reasons.
<1> I bet you didn't do very well at all.
<0> Well it can only fit 2 people.
<0> ll i had two cats and i'd try to put make up on them .
<0> I'm not sure. I have never been a pilot. I am a lawyer. 
<1> And did it not go over well?
<1> Thank you, when I become a famous politician I'll remember you.
<0> No one from my family is going with us, and I never wanted to go on a cruise anyways. People die on those ships "mysteriously" way too often.
<1> Need to help both nah
<0> haha what type of music do you like ?
<0> At least you've had things to do! What kind of cars did you fix?
<0> I wish I know how to dance
<1> I like that tshirt and I'm going to order it.
<1> My favorite part is helping the researchers with their studies.But it really depends on the aims of the day.
<0> Yes, definitely
<1> Have you ever tried eating the rind of a watermelon after you cooked it? Apparently, it's edible, although I've never tried it.
<0> Yea, that's pretty cool! I own red hiking boots too.
<1> I don't either. Eating healthy is so expensive nowadays.
<0> ok. My best friend has OCD which has a big impact in my life
<1> It's pretty aweful. I'm probably going to sell it.
<1> the best work for me is something with numbers. i can't draw or paint to save my life.
<0> no but i was very mad
<1> It is risky but that is the fun of it
<0> I would think so. I would love to go on a cruise to Alaska, though. It's considered the 3rd least populous state, which makes it appealing! 
<1> I don't want to give away the story. I recommend you pick up a copy and read it. 
<0> After you grow them for a few years you can start harvesting them biennially. 
<1> That's my daughters favourite too 
<1> Yes, because some people can have allergies to Oates when they are ingested.
<0> true, it was ranked as the greatest cartoon aside from the simpsons
<0> That's true about piercing!  I can deal with that.  Gets to be pretty crazy once you start talking about body stretching.  Usually a good idea to go in small increments so that you don't damage any skin tissue. 
<0> It sure does. I can still remember changing his diapers.
<1> I don't know.  You will probably never get better after this loss.
<0> My friends call me The Hulk because I am so big. 
<1> I don't either! They would have to be something very wrong as I couldn't imagine hurting an innocent!
<0> I am an electrical engineer. I haven't been doing it long.
<1> wow that's dumb.
<0> i wont like to look
<0> Well it is far as its 13 hour flight from Japan where I am living.
<0> I'm a perfectionist. I like everything in place.
<1> I understand. That's why I never played sports.
<0> i love salad as my ready to eat food
<0> My family made a ravioli dish, but I don't really care for it.
<1> I love cold weather! I don't like going to beaches or tropical places.
<0> Yes, the German autobahns have no speed limit in many areas. Good thing if you have a Porsche, lol.
<1> That one's not too far from me, but I've never been. I'll check that one out while you check out Dorney and we'll compare notes!
<0> No at all. I am the one helping him.
<1> He never cooks, I do all the cooking.
<1> im not from texas. im from missouri

<0> I am sure that he found a good home. He was a lab and hound mix,  about 1 years old.
<0> i work as an accountant . good pay .
<0> Nowadays I have come to know that cancer is bigger than athletes foot,its a disaster of its own.
<0> yea and i could whatever i want when i win
<0> I will pace myself in my next marathon.  How important is staying hydrated during the race?
<1> Congratulations! That's a great accomplishment. I know my fiance and I will get that far too.
<0> I agree, I've been there and seen it myself so I know exactly what you're talking about.
<1> No, actually loved it!!
<1> Tell him to f&^% off!
<1> I don't use any cake recipes because I dislike cakes in general.

<0> I would never be able to give up meat, I have a steak a day.
<0> No because I didn't study.

<0> Impressive. Here in FL we have the oldest American brewer, Yuengling
<1> I'd love my world to change. We plan on having 5 kids some day.
<1> Yeah, he's probably going to have a great time. 
<0> Mahjong has always been a mystery to me as well. It is familiar but the rules to playing it are elusive.
<0> I get my kids Mcdonalds occasionally since it is way cheaper. Have you had the new Popeyes chicken sandwich?
<0> i can speak not only english but french pretty fluently
<0> good and bad mostly funny
<0> I hope so,  that would be nice
<1> That is smart. Sugar is tasty but it has nothing good for a body.
<0> Me too, I've never won anything. I always finish last.
<0> I dont have yet
<1> I sell cars
<1> where are you from actually ? i miss home as though
<1> It can be hard especially for senior citizens.
<1> Yes, I do enjoy their coffee and their frozen drinks too. My girlfriend loves their frappes.
<1> Yes carbs are good because I hate meat and I'm a vegan viking.
<0> Actually, I already have a job. Been there for 5 years now. 
<0> Yes I get both reactions, but it doesn't bother.
<1> Maybe you should just wallow in it, actually.
<0> It is large, but it certainly is cold there too.
<0> Oh, I see.  I also like it hot. Pfanner and Rauch are the most popular manufacturers of tea? Maybe they make a hot tea you would like.
<1> Don't do that I wouldn't recommend getting food at all. Spend it at the mall.
<1> It's super fun, I went last summer.
<0> No, i don't listen to ColdPlay.
<1> I will go there tomorrow morning.
<0> This is strange because he always pays me back.
<1> Sounds like you're living your best life.
<1> I didn't like college much myself either.  That's a great idea though, we will start training together
<0> That would be sad to win a lot of money,  then lose it all.
<1> I think that the population rising is not a good sign for the state of the economy.
<1> I hope you stay at the hospital in pain
<0> You are right, the scallion is the strongest onion in taste and odor. 
<1> i've considered that field but for now i just watch videos
<0> I don't have a mother. My mother died when I was 20 years old. I have not seen her for years
<0> Maybe there are medications to take in case the crackers don't help?
<0> For doing a good job.
<0> that is not fun . animals are always good to have around .
<1> We haven't played live recently because our saxophonist left the band.

<1> That’s great, I’m not too surprised by it tho because a lot of cab drivers are very nice and generous
<0> I don't like the outdoors.
<0> Don't worry you will find someone some day! Just gotta keep looking and opportunity will come to you. 
<0> Yeah it's been like a month and a half since I've seen them. 
<1> I m a good houswife
<1> Oh my! My grandfather worked at a paper mill. They would pour feces from sewage into the mix to create the paper!
<0> 52 years
<1> Unfortunately I do, which stinks because I can't stand to look at the smiling faces on those little demon's faces.
<0> I enjoy working on cars. I also like working with animal;s
<0> That's probably why it tires me out and the more I think about it, the more I don't want to join a swim team.  I'm on a softball team and it's a lot of fun; I'll stick with that.
<0> Mine are all adults. All 5 of them.
<1> I hate classical. I need something with words to keep me busy at work.
<0> No, I don't like sports where you have to compete with each other.
<0> So they were made before that but they were first patented back in 1929?
<0> No at all . it is very easy 
<0> good thinking man.there is a lot to explore before that. any hobbies?
<0> Rain is good sometimes,  but the sun needs to shine tomorrow.
<0> He's 45 and just going back now,  to start his business degree.
<1> very true ! what is your favorite season ? mine is summer .
<1> oh then great 
<1> agreed, people are already very cautious on the road and that will make it safer
<0> That would be great! Then I can maintain a helathy diet that supports my energy needs with no exposure to toxicity 
<0> Yeah, the summers might be too cold for you
<1> I hope so, I don't know if he'll like it though. 
<1> I used to live there many years ago
<1> I'm sure it was,  but it always a great idea to be looking to improve yourself or your position. Do what is best for you.
<1> My favourite colour is Red and turquoise is my least favourite.
<0> oh , that sucks . i just recently bought my first home in springfield missouri !
<0> My life is terrible. I am so sad and hopeless.
<0> I have never played soccer before actually, it doesn't interest me. 
<1> You must be very happy enjoying the cold then, it is really hot here staying not too far from the desert.
<1> its very funny when you forget things like that

<1> I do not like music i prefer to read and stay in a quiet place
<1> I honestly dislike travelling it makes me home sick.
<0> What are you talking about? I have no kids...
<0> i really like to eat pizza
<1> I can eat just about anything.  Nothing really grosses me out.
<1> with the excitement that you have,ill definitely get up there
<0> Well, I really enjoy windsurfing. It's great to feel the water and the wind on my face, my red hair blowing behind me. It's exhilarating!
<0> I talked her into coming over to my apartment to watch funny movies and eat junk food to get her mind off of it.
<0> I wish we could,but he's very willful and won't sit still long enough to be in a show.
<1> You're right. It is hard. Most people wouldn't have the willpower.
<0> I find working with animals easy to do but it is not very rewarding at times. I would love to work with people. 
<1> That sounds like a good plan. How big is your garden?
<0> I do not know much about technology and am not willing to learn it
<1> It is so sad. I worry everyday about my school age kids.
<0> I'm not sure how he ended up being a DJ, but Andrew Taggart was at Syracuse and interning for a record company before they met.
<0> Yes, I was a scout throughout school and went camping with my troop all of the time.
<1> No, I don't do research, I mostly sail ships. 
<0> that is why I've never had kids
<0> once in a while, history is good
<0> I can't have parrots because of my kids.
<1> My favorite color car is red. You didn’t like it
<0> they are both younger than me by a couple years
<0> unless you got enough cash we can
<0> I don't care for it.  I'm not a fan of the soft pastels.
<1> not anymore . how about you ?
<0> No,  not reallt
<1> Oh I have numbness in my hands so I am always spilling things so don't feel too bad! I understand though. As you can see- I don't like having stuff on my clothes either lol
<0> actually i saw it before
<0> Oh war for sure. I love wars. They're so cinematic!
<1> Actually, I don't like sports. I wouldn't want to go to a game.
<0> I like to have extra time. I'm going to take a break now. I am going to order pizza and cake for dinner. 
<1> I have never driven a car.
<0> maybe they will you have just got to give them a chance and be patient
<1> i have run marathon race before 
<1> It's great however I wish they would stick to hand-drawn or computer animated, not a combination of them.
<0> I think they are real.  
<0> it is.. good .. big portions and a reasonable price
<1> I like leather jackets. Being a dude, I feel every dude should have one. Like James Dean. I', into old movies.
<0> i hope things work out for you i've to go
<1> College is horrible though, you'll see.
<0> I hope so too,  I wish they would have done them right then,  but they are making me wait.  It's so nerve-wracking!
<1>  i have kids and I can't wait to have my own kids.
<0> I used hard boiled eggs a lot in egg salad and sometimes tuna salad.  The cool thing about egg salad is you can add a number of different things to it
<0> That's cool, what kind of projects do you ordinarily work on?
<1> I bet it wasn't bad at all. Food and a place inside, how bad can that be?
<1> oh man that is horrible!  I am so sorry
<1> You should paint then.
<1> Actually ya im single 
<0> He is from Michigan. Kid Rock originally started out as a DJ interestingly enough.
<1> I should too, I never been out of the United States.
<0> You have to look it up on YouTube! It's hilarious with Christopher Walken playing a music producer and Will Ferrell is playing the cowbell on a song they're recording.
<0> Yes and the norms of the tradition began around 1550!
<1> I already knew that!
<1> My favorite sport is swimming! And yours?
<1> so tell me more about yourself
<1> Oh! Then you must never be proud of yourself. 
<0> That's true. If you're ever in Florida, you can get free orange juice or grapefruit juice at any of their Florida Welcome Centers.
<0> Same here. I dont like Jamica very much either
<1> I DON'T HAVE ANY. AND RECENTLY I HEARD THAT COURSE YOU CHOOSED IS NOT VERY POPULAR AT ALL. 
<1> While I like Scottie, I think Michael J achieved his status on his own merit.  He's probably over-rated, but I really like the guy.
<1> I'm 17.
<0> i just a nice fall color
<1> It doesn't sound nice, i hate going for concert is boring.
<1> I don't think she has studied enough to do well though.

<1> i hate rock music, i prefer rap
<0> I hope so. I actually want to be an eye doctor because my eyesight is so good.
<1> You should try not to be angry at your friend and be happy for him. 
<1> No but cooking is done by chefs in restaurants or people cooking at home seems like everyone cooks
<0> Yea me too, but I hate playing baseball. 
<1> Yeah, I'm glad my family is healthy. It's a blessing.
<1> I don't think I'd like to receive anything like that.
<1> I'm glad your parents stayed together.
<1> Good. but i think your co-workers are terrible people.
<0> I turned up late and a sweaty mess. Then I talked all the way throguh a movie
<1> You'll find a way to make it up to him, I don't think something as simple as ice cream would be enough to console him on this one. 
<0> No, I don't find that very facinating
<1> prenter ? congratulations . keep it clean . i sound like my husband now , lol
<0> and what are those two things ?
<1> I have a solution for that,  but I wouldn't advocate you doing it. 
<1> How long did you play as a kid?
<0> He's got it easy. He never gets hit. The running back dose everything.
<0> My wife said I'm too clingy sometimes, though.
<0> Yes, also the 1918 influenza and the Great Depression probably contributed to a lot of children here being orphaned back in the day. 
<0> Yuck. I may not make it to work if it gets bad here.
<1> Ops!! I'm not.  No really like grasshoppers and my body diet doesn't allow for it
<0> My boss treats me well.
<1> Please don't, this is so boring. 
<1> Cars are so boring. I know nothing about the history behind them.
<1> Oh wow, we will probably plan a huge wedding there so that we can all zipline at the same time
<1> wow where are you from then ?
<1> Yeah, I don't really like Italian food though.
<1> Me too, I don't like watching any type of fight
<1> I can only handle one as well! They can be a hand full for sure!
<0> Monaco is on one of the borders of France.
<0> Figures.  I have been drinking plenty of water.  I should skip my workouts as well, right?
<1> No I think all meat tastes disgusting. 
<1> Yes girls you are doing the right thing. 
<1> i do love playing in the snow . . but i miss my garden during winter lol
<1> No, I think all dogs are ugly and mean. I dont like them at all.

<1> I would, but I really do not like spaghetti.
<1> my whole life really. I don't play as much as I used to though. Never too late to learn
<0> i do not believe in influence 
<0> It is crazy! I've never met or spoken to people who were alive during the depression and WWII. 
<1> In my opinion, nothing. You should trust them they are your family after all, maybe it was someone else who took it or you miscalculated. Just keep track from next time and It probably will never happen again.

<1> By physical do you mean phsically fit, or aggressive, or both?

<0> well i have no ideas about basket ball
<0> I don't really know. It just reminds of when life was easier.
<0> Someone that I went to high school with is really sick and it sounds like they might die soon.  Its upsetting to hear news like that.  It makes you think about things.
<0> That is amazing! What else can you tell me about Zumba?
<0> I've had a rough life,  the last 40 years have been a trainwreck. Betrayal,  family problems,  basically I went to prison for a crime that my mother committed,  and now my life is screwed.

<1> No I do not unfortunately. The Prima ballerina is Dame Margot Fonteyn though.
<0> I know the big turkey legs and jugs of drink...looks pretty good to me.  I wonder if musical instruments are sold at the craft tables.

<0> I'm not really interested in dance at all. I think it's boring.
<0> Interesting. I know all about taxi cabs and how they got started.
<1> I need to find someone who can give it a full overhaul. Maybe 10 kegs will do it LOL

<1> I agree they are so interesting 
<0> I have seen every single one.
<1> I'm lucky in that I'm sort of the 'chosen one' in my family. The rest of my family really looks up to me and asks me for advice all of the time.
<0> I think it would be interesting. They could easily re enact the strategic bombing with close air support and tactical air power for really cheap using CGI.
<0> I spend a lot of time at work making hamburgers and other food. 
<0> Actually, that's not true. The Vitamin C content actually increases over time.

<1> I dont have any experience with presentations, so I'm just doing my best to guess what could help. 
<0> I hate snakes too, that's why I would never live in the desert.
<1> Lots of people are afraid at night, but I don't think there's anything scary about it.
<1> But I've seen the easter bunny in my closet before!  Haven't you seen it?
<0> I don't have a brother. I have two sisters.

<0> I honestly think the Red Cross is a fraud company.  
<1> Yes, Always be positive to everyone and support them in anyway you can.

<0> I don't like any novels. I love poetry, though.
<0> Draft beers are good too! It's hard for me to find my favorite local draft beer in other places though. That's why I like to bring cans with me when I go places. 
<0> good.
<1> Well, lazy people tend to lose. Real winners don't need hard work because they are naturally gifted. 
<0> I like playing the flute, guitars are to much work to play
<0> That is why I hate cats. I would never buy a cat because they eat a lot. 
<0> I don't have any special work to do. So now a days I have started playing piano. It is my hobby and I love it.
<0> It is! I spent all my winnings on it after pouring $500, 000 down the shame. I was so angry.
<1> Wonderful. I have flavored it with cocoa and in the mornings make it with chopped apples and cinnamon.
<1> its not really worth it to just relax though, theres always work to do and money to be made!
<0> No not at all. I just got up and couldnt stop laughing at myself. I could feel the heat coming off of my face.
<0> Yeah definitely, the house it always filled with music it really lifts everyone's mood.

<1> That's stupid. I don't care. 
<0> i am sorry . i am a plexus consultant , motivated mostly because i wanna lose weight
<0> I've tried a few unique buns but I never heard of macaroni and cheese. One day I would like to make my own bread but I'll stick to sauces now.

<1> Oh, she definitely is. She used to be so naughty!
<0> Oh that's great! Surfing is the sport I like the most.

<0> no. i hate working on different types of cars for living i do it
<1> No, we just go for my kids to swim and wear themselves out.
<1> I swam in high school
<1> That's too bad. I don't like to hear people whine all day, especially children. They have it so easy, why do they always have to whine to me for?
<1> i so much dislike purple color, they aren't just attractive
<0> She is! I had to comfort her. I felt so bad for her 
<0> Not intentionally.  "baby" is one of his songs.
<0> I hardly go to casinos, so I'm not worried about getting addicted.
<0> I am pretty busy right now. You can try learn it on your own like me.
<0> i am sure it does i learned italian years ago and i still practice .

<0> Yeah!
<0> Wow if he only knew how famous he could have become.
<0> Well you have time because women on average are ready to accept proposals after 4 years of dating.
<0> Yes, I am familiar with the rules.
<0> No, I don't think so. It's not very enjoyable. 
<0> exactly. I recently got myself a george foreman grill, spending way too much time just sitting in the garden grilling a good steak in the evenings
<1> Me too, I hate rap music! most of the time I can't even understand what they are saying.
<0> have you ever been to paris ? i go whenever i can afford it
<0> yes I do not like yellow and black together
<1> What? I am not expecting anything or package.
<1> Yeah that sucks,  I have gone through that too

<0> Thanks I love going to gig alone. 
<1> I think weight lifing is a horrible idea.
<1> I like to eat them whole

<0> She's constantly jealous and I feel stifled 
<1> that is true but I always thought George Harrison got too much attention
<0> I always thought that store mix wan't as good as making it from scratch. That's really interesting. Why is store bought better?
<0> I wish I had siblings to go camping with. I'm an only child. 
<1> I can see the why you would feel that way. I would be worried too. I'd hate for it to get between me and my passions, also.
<0> thank you!! i can't wait to spend the bonus. So excited
<1> ha ha , you need to cut down on ice cream
<0> It's pretty relaxing! It doesn't require much out of you,  so if you enjoy being out with nature (and getting something good to eat while you're doing it),  it's a fun time.
<1> Nothing, when you die its the end.
<0> fun . it is an electronic dance version , but it is fun ,
<1> Yeah.  that is terrible.
<1> Yeah, I don't really care for Beethoven or classical music. I'm more of a rock and roll kind of guy. 
<1> i use to play mario years ago but now i do not play
<0> I got my divorce because he was into drugs behind my back, I didn't know because we were both active duty Army and stationed apart. So many diffrent reasons people do it!
<1> oh that is super cool ! i write short stories
<0> Yes, I do. We went on a date last week and I had the most delicious oysters.
<0> I agree, ice cream is the best
<0> Yes and pits and pit mixes have such a reputation.  Most of them really don't deserve it.  
<1> I think your friend sounds difficult to deal with. 
<0> Children are drawn to anime, I think, because of its colorful graphics, fantasy theming and vibrant characters. It seems to really resonate with kids, if you know what I mean!
<1> It is just one acre of a land, nothing on it to keep me busy aside from some grass.
<0> I believe so. The red in their flag happens to be my favorite color
<1> I don't know any of her songs
<0> I'd love to own a boat someday.
<0> Yeah, my beagles are great hunters.
<0> Im supposed to be eating healthier,  and major failed this week. 
<0> No,  just the regular national lottery draw. I was so happy
<0> Well hopefully he is at least able to get the social support that he needs from other people in his social network.
<0> Probably a sushi restaurant!
<1> Your son doesn't need college . It's a waste of time
<1> Oh dear, that is quite the interesting story. I'm glad I'm still young and don't have to worry about making the same mistake.
<0> the girl who drank the moon . a good book .
<0> I like Mortal Kombat X, which is a fighting game published by Warner Bros. It is so fun.
<0> Both of them are a mix of many things. Both rescues as well. 
<0> I don't like it yet. I am really feeling this empty nest.
<1> Just like his music. I don't enjoy it much.
<0> That is find the hunters is some days
<0> I thought Paul Rudd was really good in that movie and Michael Pena was really funny. I am more partial to Iron Man and Captain America though. Black Panther was really good too I just saw it.
<0> Oh no I don't want that thanks, I hate fashionable boots.
<1> I grew up in Oklahoma and love the Sooners!
<0> Yes, unfortunately I am unemployed right now so maybe not the best. Do you work?
<1> i understand, I hate going outside i would rather stay inside and sell insurance its very interesting.
<0> They are also much like BBC television dramas that have been produced to get you over the nervousness with smooth scenery shots
<0> 1968 Chevrolet.
<1> I don't have any, I'm too busy with my kids to get a dog.
<1> that could be really nice, I want to spend the evening in a VIP area! They look so nice with security, couches and bottle service.
<1> I am sure you know best.
<0> Me, too!  That's why I have my yellow lab.
<1> i'm retired so i don't really do anything these days, i haven't been to college in years
<1> Justin Beiber has been a popular musician for quite a while now, not a huge fan tho. But he is a talented singer and songwriter.
<0> I don't have a Labrador. I have a German Shepherd.
<1> No really, I allways prioritise new customers over anything else.  
<0> Some are very graceful and artistic and some are very powerful
<1> Very tight rules and I never text while driving that is very dangerous.
<1> do you ever go to the beach?
<1> I hate reading books. It is so very boring...
<1> i'm working on my law degree at night
<0> I wish. I thought it would break the ice, but it turned out bad in the end. 
<0> I am an extrovert
<0> Well there are so many endangered species in the world right now, why we need to bother about saving parrots.
<1> I don't have children. I haven't even finished school yet!

<1> I remember throwing food over and watching them catch it as a kid.
<1> You can actually be a tormenting person to them
<0> Yes, there are 2 local no-kill shelters.  It is too hard to go to a place where they routinely put down the animals.  I try to foster animals as much as possible as well.
<1> I certainly wouldn't choose teaching as my profession i had a terrible teacher in high school
<0> Yeah, it's a good thing I have my own prescription glasses. Wearing them right now actually.
<1> I think the best thing to do is just tell her you did it on purpose.
<1> True, but I can't relate to what you're saying.
<1> Oh come on, a year goes by so fast, get over it already!!

<0> He has written at least 10 books and I have read them all. 
<0> Jim Cooper does a really good job at portraying Sheldon
<0> What is your favorite burger on their menu?
<0> Technical drawing is very collaborative. It's great sending someone a piece and having their ideas expand upon it. I can make really diverse pieces that way. 
<0> Sadly they only made one Starship Troopers movie though.
<0> Me too, they might actually make it to the Superbowl this year. What are some famous attractions I can see over there?
<0> I just wish I knew more about swedish history.

<0> I should have just stopped since it was just me in the car.
<1> I always eat out, I hate cooking for myself. 
<1> Yeesh, that attitude is so off putting. You should be ashamed of yourself.
<0> Damn you trolled me epic style my friend.
<0> One car I dislike is a Ford Mustang as it looks so boring!

<1> I'm sure things will get better.  Keep your head up.
<0> I may try spotify, i am always searching for new music.
<1> You can't do any of that if you're a vegan though. Vegans reject that animal should even be commodities at all.
<1> It sure does! The delivery method affects things like how fast it causes you to feel the effects of the drug, intensity and enjoyment etc.
<1> Oh, me either. I think it makes people look cheap.
<0> Between the Zhou and Ming dynasties, production of alcohol was made illegal and then legal again.

<1> Haha, I don't they they are the type of friends to get you a cake with rum.
<1> It's weird that you weren't able to find one, since there are quite a few around.
<1> I make them like that all the time!
<0> yea we almost have more space explored than the ocean.
<0> Some ran away in terror. Others in disgust. I think I sent one to the ER even. At any rate,  I was mortified and I am sure I won't ever live this tragedy down.

<1> Yeah, people can often be very nice as well.
<1> I think the original Star Trek is horrible and old fashioned.  The new ones are much better

<0> Is that place far away? I don't like driving in a fall. Such a sad time of the year when it looks like all summer beauty is just fading away.
<0> Haha,  maybe next time
<0> I don't really have one.  I am not into sports very much.
<1> California is where I met my wife!
<0> Thank god a Co-worker didn't catch me, I wouldn't want to waste my time explaining.
<0> I've been working at the local pizza restaurant for the past 2 months.
<0> Thank you, I will surely tell her you said so. I know, I can't stand the bugs. I called pest control to come out to the house tomorrow. It is like we have a roach infestation, I just dont know where they came from. 
<1> Very infrequently, we don't really have time from our personal lives.
<0> Yea? What are your staples to get from there?
<1> No I don't like beer. My husband does.
<1> Guns are not dangerous! my dad drives my kids anywhere and carries a gun in his car.
<0> Same! We are going to get the new Call of Duty game and order pizza.
<0> I don't care about ancient stuff like that. Modern tools for a modern guitar, I always say.
<1> I would not waste my time using Chopin, it is such boring and uninteresting type of music.
<1> wow , that s so cool , and you love it here
<1> Yes, but I don't like going to my local brew pub.
<1> I don't trust doctors either. That's why I'm a homeopathic medicine proponent. 
<0> Ok ,where does pizza first originate in?
<1> flower bulbs are very scarce.
<1> No, I don't have a family, I'm unmarried. 
<0> It's electronic but more down tempo and chill than EDM
<0> Yes I don't like hanging around broke people
<0> none here . what about you ?
<0> They do have a lot of freedom. Did you know that an armadillos name in spanish means "little armored one"?
<0> I have never eaten Asian meals. i do not think i will like it.
<0> ha ! no doubt . do you have a favorite place to travel to ?
<1> We have lots of scenic hills and mountains where I live in New Hampshire.
<1> As you're hopeful,  you will get it
<0> I hope I do alright. I'm a bit weak.
<1> I find that to be the most peaceful way to fish.
<0> i have never heard of that .
<1> It's gotten pretty popular. Do you associate field hockey more with women or men? I wonder if it's the same as lacrosse, where body contact is not allowed (although stick contact is...)
<1> I wish I had one! I have never kept one and I don't like them as well. Though, I will try to keep one in future.
<0> how many pets do you have
<0> If you are hiking in bear country you should bring some protection. Bears near the coast tend to be larger. Bring an airhorn or a weapon.
<1> I wouldn't know. I look like an idiot.
<0> Yes, i used to live in Venezuela and in there, there were houses in wich the isolate patients that were potencially risk to the society, there were a lot of human rights activist involved in this cases!
<0> See? That's the thing that would lose me, the mental part... 21 kilometers is a 5 hour race, right?
<0> I feel panicked. I don't like being around a lot of people at once. I wish I didn't feel that way but I just don't like big stores and lots of people.
<0> Yes I went back after my payday and gave him ten dollars
<1> I know. While my father hates Metallica he actually went to every Beatles concert.
<1> i disagree , i think that politics tends to bring out the best in people.
<0> Oh I wish I had a truck, my life sucks and I can't believe my girlfriend left me. 
<0> i like to sing so i'm in chorus at school
<0> you know when thinking about translation i was strictly thinking about sign language lol. can you tell me the exact definition of translation cuz i think i am a bit confused
<0> I would imagine it could be quite comical as well.  
<0> They were constantly struggling to produce precision products, I'm currently into pilot/cosmonaut watches.
<0> My sweetheart and I have been married for several years
<0> Yeah they all dress very shabby and old looking hats
<0> i want to go to nashville tennesse
<0> i am 50 now it seems unlikely
<0> Do you know Carlton Cole or any professional footballer?
<0> I used to take the ferry for rides on the Puget sound. The Vashon ferry.
<0> Wasn't fun at all. Cleaning the mess took a while
<1> i've a very huge love for all dogs .
<0> I have never flown in my entire life. 
<0> You can always brush more. Then you will be fine and not need the dentist. 
<0> It has a lot to do with an individuals circadian timing system its more scientific than lazy.
<1> I read and spend time on the computer.
<1> Yeah traveling is always a bad time, The word travel must have been around since the use of words. 
<0> oh my , when i am not feeling well , i spend time sitting in my garden .
<0> Loud music is just fine. I just flow with the positive energy
<1> i like fish . also love tea but drink way too much of it .
<1> Not me. I'm the biggest kind of introvert. All I want to do is spend time by myself. 
<1> You will never find out.
<1> uh oh ! congrats that is awesome !
<0> I write about my parents, I love them,they are great.
<1> Well, one thing is for sure, my work as a scientist should help me find a cure for it.
<1> I HATE the Beatles. Queen is MUCH better!
<1> Yes it is, but I like hard working it is great for me to keep active and fit!
<0> I'm not interested in Mars at all.  Let's get some ice cream. 
<0> No, I was never a fan of skateboarding. I preferred riding a bike. 
<0> Yes,  I have season tickets.
<0> Humans are actually the saviors and we do not cause any animals to go extinct.
<1> Ha ha,  that's a good one.  
<1> I hate Belgian Mallnois dogs because they're scary. 
<0> yes , i've to have salt on everything
<1> I hate new clothes the first day of school. Feels like I am showing off. 
<1> We moved to New York. It's quite nice here, a bit dirty, though and the trains are slower
<0> nope.. it happens all the time at work
<0> The best investment strategy is gambling and the lottery.
<1> i use my cheap car my dad bought me to deliver food as my alter ego
<1> I have lived there for 20 years!
<1> i don't know i don't think you have any fun
<1> It's OK, I don't think moms all are that great, especially mine.
<1> I hate hockey. I hate most sports.
<1> I am single too. Being single is great because you don't have to answer to anyone.
<0> every weekend they come by to visit
<1> Do you have a dog?
<0> Really? I did not know such laws exist but it's awesome. Where do you live?
<0> Yes good, how was your day, tell me your experience to working a novel.
<1> my daughter plays the sax and several other instruments .
<1> Did you not call the police?
<0> yes that sound is really good
<0> I work for an employment agency.  Actually, our desks are right next to each other so I see her a lot.
<1> Don't do that be carefull with the gun
<0> Nice! I actually dropped out of school to pursue a music career. I want to form a hard rock band.
<0> You're really smart. I like your ideas. I should go read my book.
<1> I don't clean up after mine I don't see why I should.
<0> that is so nice of you !
<1> omg!  aren't they really poisonous?
<1> I really don't care how your old friends are doing.
<0> I'm not afraid and that sounds like fun. 
<0> Cool! The documentary featured live performance by pop singers like Rihanna and Britney Spears.
<1> No, unfortunately not. It was a lot of fun however so was just happy to take part and be amongst the atmosphere.
<1> I have a couple.  I'm trying to get my kids interested in mechanics.  I like cars.
<1> No I don't have any pets
<0> It is a bit different variation of basketball but its early development of its kind which began in England in 1890s
<1> cool, do you get free food?
<1> Dating is lame and boring  and not meant for humans.
<0> I am!  It can't come fast enough!  I'm hoping for great weather since it'll be outside.
<0> One day when I take my first trip to Brazil I'll have to make a stop in Argentina.
<0> I just wish I could finally buy this game called Destiny.
<0> That is really wrong on so many levels and pretty much all goes back to what I mentioned earlier, exploitation of labour.
<0> Haha, that's the ones used for promotion by the Anheuser-Busch Brewing Company? I heard about them.
<1> That's true, usually this happens when the marriage and relationship itself dissolves. So those who picked the right person won't divorce.
<1> who is edm ? maybe i will try it . need something to listen too when i travel .
<0> Yeah it was a lot of fun. Suprise parties are great way to make your friends happy.
<0> Exactly, so freedom of 'Speech' doesn't just include public speaking, but also the internet.
<1> i do not know . do you have a favorite color ?
<0> Yes but I couldn't go because of work. Guess I will have to suck it up and be lonely for a while.
<1> That drives me crazy too!  I can't get back to sleep once I wake up to go to the bathroom.  Hope you get some smooth zzzzz's tonight! 
<1> Same.
<1> So you never had a car?
<0> It's a good thing I'm already really good in college! 
<0> And I believe you can still have several legal wives in some countries, right?
<1> Not in the army, but I was in the fbi, G13 classified
<0> The Israelis developed it into a weapon 
<1> I can't relate unfortunately. I really hated being around my family.
<1> Wouldn't that be a funny story if I were?
<1> i am not married no kids
<1> I can't stand dogs, they are dirty and loud.
<1> Oh wow, that is remarkable I guess it would have to take a long time to get to Shih Tzus
<0> I don't have any children.
<1> where are you from if you don't mind me asking
<0> I'm not really into shopping, I find it kind of boring. 
<1> kind of i kicked the ball for extra points or a field goal
<1> coo coo , so whats up ?
<0> I am very nervous.  It is completely optional so I might just cancel it.
<1> But sometimes life skills may not help some people.
<0> Music is very new.
<0> Yeah that's the one I have, it's really nice and new, I like playing it a lot.
<1> I bet.  Its probably cheaper than therapy though!
<1> I don't work with newspapers. I am a electrician.
<0> so i guess you have not heard of all american rejects my fav band ?
<0> I live in the capital city of Malawi.
<0> Unfortunately yes! Yorkie legs are only so long!
<1> I am a fan of volcanoes. I have seen a few in my lifetime. I would love to see the ones in Iceland. 
<0> okay, so he is an artist who takes ordinary stuff and makes art out of it
<0> Sounds cool! Maybe I'll look more into getting them, then. I think it could be a good investment. Any lasting impressions you want to make before I go?
<0> no , lol he's sixteen . cars and box are his thing
<1> I work there too as a reporter. 
<1> ok..very nice
<0> I am a poor college student and needed to eat the leftovers. Thought it would stay good for all eternity. Guess it doesn't when it's cooked.
<0> I do not like the color blue
<1> We take vacations all the time where there is nothing to keep us occupied.
<0> Yes,  I am glad I was ready for it.
<0> yes, color can.
<1> yeah it can be rough sometime. especially considering the fact that I once was was in a show but I wasn't lucky even then...
<1> So cute! You must be so proud! You should teach him more tricks!
<0> I will not know about the word crochet
<1> You could just damage the condoms you know. He has to do his part too.
<0> No but they wouldn't let him off the field because it wasn't time to sub! He kept falling!
<1> yes i visit different churches and homes and make friends from them
<1> I hope all of your belongings were ruined. 
<0> I will probably never use the hand knitted one my grandmother made for me. 
<0> The food I hate the most is pizza and wings, so messy.
<1> They're my favorite! 
<0> What caused it?
<1> My parents just had a celebration for their thirtieth wedding anniversary yesterday. 
<1> That's why I prefer to buy used cars. It's more fun and economical to fix up a junker.
<0> The surgeon will fix it guaranteed, they are experienced with fixing shoulders. Although I'm not a fan of surgery and would not like to be a orthopedic surgeon when I graduate medical school.
<1> good work for kitty very well.
<0> texas state, tech major and a minor in mechanics.
<1> I don't personally care for poodles. From what I hear they can be kind of snotty. 
<0> I wish my area had a supermarket.
<0> They do,  and they are trying to catch these people. Its sad there are people like that, 
<0> I always thought Faace off is a bad show I saw in my life.
<0> Yea,  I mean,  I would rather pay more than get skimpy toppings like that.
<0> Yes, I did know that. I know all about Woodstock. 
<1> Am a financial advisor and have a higher income. Working as a Standardized test won't allow you to meet you goal anyway. I urge you to switch profession.
<0> Oh now I have never tried their macaroni cheese. I will put it on my list for next time.  KFC was founded by Colonel Sanders who began selling his own receipe for fried chicken from the roadside.  Now its in so many countries around the world!
<0> drake is better though some rap artist is still good
<1> i should help you.
<0> I can't wait to sign my daughter up for her first beauty pageant!
<0> That's definitely true,  I just worry that the grass is always greener on the other side.
<0> So do I, but my children hate eating seafood.
<1> Where do you live?
<0> yeah , everybody likes food . except my girlfriend . . she's pretty anorexic .
<0> i'd rather watch then participate. i am more into puzzles 
<0> I never really write. I'm too busy with my full time job working as an accountant. 
<0> He's about 11 or 12, and yeah he's healthy since I take him to a general practice vet.
<1> Anywhere to get away from having to ride these horses on the farm!
<0> Yeah, although it's sunny and nice here, so I try and get out.
<0> i'm at school part time too business major . i'd like to open my own school .
<0> Nice choices there. I wish to be a fashion designer some day.
<0> Good throughout my life, I played several styles. But I certainly keep the shooter and RPG. I like fantasy and adventure.
<0> Oh, I am working on a bridal gown with lots of intricate details and challenging tasks. 
<1> i have been to the miami bech in florida
<0> I absolutely will. I see you like animals with higher intelligence, not sure if pandas fit that. But they are cuddly!
<0> you ever play bingo ?
<1> That's nice. $5k isn't a good amount, but it's better than nothing I guess.
<0> That's too bad. My wife and I love orange soda. 
<0> i really didn't enjoyed on the surprise trip
<0> football is too bore so i prefer basketball
<0> i love to cook fresh veggies from the garden when kids are home
<0> Actually I do, because I like him
<0> Yes,  those were the good old days!
<0> Oh, it's when people used to sleep in two shifts. It was rare
<0> Yeah,  I use that too! What breed do you have?
<0> I'm not sure who the first was, but Abraham Lincoln was one such attorney who would ride the circuit!
<0> Really? It looks like a boring continuation of all of the previous games to me.
<1> so what else are you into ?
<0> I eat broccoli everyday so I know it doesn't affect me.
<0> Well, I guess farmers are having a tough time of it now. Maybe they got out in time.
<0> my car is a 2011 volkswagen passat i like it a lot
<0> not not bad to text and drive like people say. I think it fine to do it 
<1> Actually I do! As a librarian, I spend my days cooped up inside so it's nice to go out and golf every now and then. How about you?
<1> As the friend of a teacher, his teachers will know what is best for him, so you should leave it to them to continue his progress.
<1> I wish they could have worked it out - it was like they were meant to be together.
<1> Stephen King.  My favorite novel is The Stand. 
<0> Wow. Sounds like you love your job! Inspiring young children is where it is rewarding
<1> yes he is for sure, i think batman is overrated and i hate him.
<0> My parents are so supportive of me and my mom helped me dye my hair blue the first time at age 10.
<1> sounds like you got it all together
<1> Oh boy,  have a great time!
<1> Yes. I find it easier to make my own food now. I don't really go out to eat much. How is your experience?
<1> I had injuries, but was ok in a few days. Lost my coveted Jimi Hendrix CDs.
<0> Hopefully, issues like rising tuition and funding cutbacks don't cause the college attendance rate to decline further
<0> what make and models do you like
<0> It's pretty bad.
<0> I don't like that band, I mostly listen to 70s disco music. 
<0> i'm an er surgeon , but i know what goes on in the entire er .
<1> That can be very rough. Maybe you can move there soon!
<0> i've not gotten back to my home if over 2 years .
<0> Love them. Licensed to Ill was my jam back in the day. and Paul's Boutique
<0> I might bring my Laptop to him tommrow and let them have a look at it then thanks
<0> I guess you can find anything online as well too including tv shows and sports.
<1> Haha what was the drink? 
<0> Mixed planting I believe is generally just having a different variety of plants, but not for cover. Not very many countries are known for using cover crops actually.
<0> yeah its a great place, however there is so much more out there to see before I repeat the same place a second time
<0> That's a fantastic idea! Are you diabetic? I know that makes it more important in the short-term.
<1> Yeah. The contrast between yellow and blue in my room was quite nice
<0> Driving to the beach. I hate mountains
<0> how can anyone ever stop liking chocolate !
<0> Yes,  we got him out and it helped him realize he was wrong and he has totally changed for the better now. That was 6 years ago.
<0> I'm glad I don't have a girlfriend. 
<0> No. I've never played golf either.
<1> I know,  at least with my son I get to experience some of that still.
<1> i imagine it is ! i was going to grab some fast food on the way home .
<0> We can do the surfing , but the dance part you can dance my friend. She's good  dancer . I am not  because I never tried to dance . I hate it. It tires me up.
<0> I am. It's my dream to one day open my own garage.
<1> The only thing I've ever collected was bottle caps.
<1> Yes, It stopped some years ago and I haven't witnessed it since then
<0> sometimes people cannot really stay together despite the desire to care for children
<1> Ah, nice. I usually need some caffein to play for long periods of time. I love me some coffee with cream
<0> I wish we would play games in the pool here at summer camp.
<0> I went right home and took a shower because I was wearing sandals.
<0> Time just goes by so fast.
<0> Yes, but its almost impossible to cultivate without a lot of practice.
<0> The victory poses are really nice and some really funny but over all i think overwatch is a great game for all people to enjoy
<0> Fishing and the fisherman have also influenced Ancient Egyptian religion
<1> Oh wow, I have never heard of the process. How long does it usually take? 
<0> Yes and I was supposed to have the day off,  but it got really busy and I had to work.
<0> Thanks! They grow up so fast lol.
<1> Definitely the hot. Of course I always pay for it later.
<0> I disagree, I went on a cruise with my family last fall and it was a lot of fun!
<1> My favorite holiday is Christmas. Halloween is too scary for me.
<0> Neither.
<1> She is about to start her treatments, but we're optimistic at this stage.
<1> that's cool. is he from there? i actually have a gf named luis who is over there on an exchange program atm
<0> Sometimes. That's where I met my husband when we were in college.
<0> Well my husband and I like to take walks in the park.
<1> You can always go back, even if you do get laid off.
<0> Yeah, I wasn't really into the betting aspect. I like the racing itself.
<0> I didn't go to school either.
<1> I see. Also, I love fishing! I have been fishing for well over two decades. I go out a lot, so I try to fish as much as I can.
<0> I am not interested in anyone else and I am busy with my kids but I miss him
<1> Since I'm Korean, a trip to Japan would be especially meaningful as a way to expand my knowledge of Asian culture.
<0> Who is Ringo?
<1> i find it easier to run when listening to my favorite group rush
<0> Yea,  we do. Does it sound like a bad thing?
<1> Well I'm glad she judged you, and I hope she doesn't make it up to you!
<1> that must be a lot of work , but rewarding .
<1> No, I don't like dogs.
<1> I hope you never find it.
<1> It's so strange that it was rained out.  There hasn't been that much rain in the US lately.
<1> I hate the color red. 
<0> It really is. We've been doing it for 5 years though,  since I've been in school.
<0> I already have a son with another ex-husband.
<1> I'm not sure--probably during one of the waves of Italian immigration during the 1800s.
<0> I don't like classic games.
<0> Yes I feel the same way. I love being able to see my mom and talk to her.
<0> Let me know how that goes! what would you eat?
<1> Oh yeah that would be such a fun find!
<0> just give me a minute, i will be back. my mom just came back from work
<0> i'd be too ugly to do that with all my freckles
<1> Well, at least you don't have to worry about them acting up. 
<0> Yeah, I was so eager to attend my class reunion.
<0> I love eating pasta, so easy to make and very delicious. 
<1> It will be easy. It's really not a hard accomplishment.
<1> I hate having friends around on gloomy days.
<0> That makes sense.  Sadly, I think bees are becoming less populous and dying off.  Have you heard that?
<0> She's the best daughter a mom could ask for :)
<0> i prefer next generation , but i enjoy them all really .
<0> That's good for sure, I'm a big fan of horror as a genre. Very fitting with this time of year too. Is that a Haloween staple?
<0> Thank you,  I sure hope so!
<1> What a showoff, she's just trying to make herself look good
<0> She's been my puppy for 10 years,  I really hope she pulls through.
<1> I don't want to know what you guys did
<0> Yeah, it hurt for over two hours!
<0> i do . netflix binging mostly though if i'm not writing
<0> I hadn't heard that. Was there a study?
<1> I can't believe you don't even like Parmesan, which is my favorite cheese.
<1> I try but I don't have any family to critique my singing ability.
<0> Regular milk it is then!
<1> no i do not i graduated from stanford , so i play out here .
<1> I don't blame you! I live for the cold.
<0> i do like country music too good messages in the songs
<1> I think Chevy's are way better than Ford, what about you?
<0> I'm not sure, I only learned recently as an adult.
<1> I live in Florida and have had shrimp nachos many times! They were delicious!
<0> kentucky scares me a bit . i get the impression its not so tolerant .
<1> OK.we will go to dinner.
<0> I understand. I will say I am no lark which is the opposite of a night owl.
<1> I was really surprised that they lost, they always play well as a team
<1> Get a nice gift for her to let her know how happy you are for them!
<0> I hate monkeys... they look too much like us, it's freaking me out!
<0> Probably lol have you ever gotten something like a knitted scarf or afghan from your grandma before?
<0> I'm not sure, I'm more of a Sci-fi person.
<0> nah this is a bearded dragon
<0> It's some great stuff! That's why I used to travel for it lol.
<1> I hate speaking with old friends. I prefer to leave the past in the past. 
<1> thats not good news
<0> I haven't. I'm almost scared to listen to it
<1> Don't get another job.
<0> Not that I know of, she’s a librarian. 
<0> NO.... man I need to call a friend or something to calm me down. I have goosebumps. 
<1> Really I got pulled over Tuesday and got one. 
<0> Yeah, you know what I hate added to ice cream?  Oatmeal.  So gross.
<0> i hear it is pretty cold there during the winter
<0> I don't think that I could ever move away from the beach.
<0> I don't like crowded places like disneyworld.
<0> it also originated in ancient India.
<1> I worked ICU fulltime for years, but it was very intense, so I cut back hours there and started cooking. And yes, it relaxes me.
<0> I might do that. Growing fruit trees is very difficult, and I've never had any success with it.
<1> I've never had a cat but my pit bull pups are just amazing!
<1> You did the right thing. I wouldn't have been able to stop thinking about it.
<0> I don't know what you mean, I've never even heard of "vampires."
<1> Really?  I also like that places.
<0> I never was  able to find the information on McDonald online. They always hide everything about their business. That is why I never ate a burger or  french fries from McDonald's.
<0> that's so cool, can you tell on weather I should start a new career or retire, I'd hate to retire.
<0> I've never studied Spanish.  Always wanted to.
<0> I really don't like singing and only get up in front of people if I am forced.
<1> Will you miss him?
<1> I disagree they are the worst band i ever heard
<1> The window banging could be a supernatural thing like ghost.
<1> I am not a fan of soy sauce or wasabi.  I did have a friend once who ate wasabi thinking it was guacamole.  That was funny!
<0> You must be right... I'm not much of a fan of rock music, so you probably know way more than I do.
<1> Me too, but it's really cold and snowy here. Too cold for walking.
<1> Yep, I was quite surprised, given he's been dead for 7 months.
<1> No. I think dedication is a waste of time.
<1> No, I don't really know anything about it.
<0> I've tried to make my own Italian styled pasta but it just wasnt the same
<1> TENNIS NOT ORIGINATED IN NORTHERN FRANCE
<0> Oh so different whiskys come from different parts of the world? 
<0> I would go shopping, I haven't done that in months!
<0> Yes, I have 3. I'm a stay at home mom. 
<0> I appreciate classical music but don't know much about it. Can you tell me more about what time period is considered classical?
<0> You're a good person too! 
<0> How do the UK mechanic operate that you mentioned earlier?
<1> I've never tried it, it is bad for your body.
<0> Yeah I was really disappointed,  it came with a raise too
<0> it seems to be rewarding .
<0> I should, because they'd probably make me feel better, but I'm so scared of needles.
<0> No it's just a get together. Maybe a mid summer celebration :)
<0> Yes it is, thinking of the move calms me down.
<1> i think i'll . what breed do you suggest ?
<0> I don't have any kids.
<0> I never saw a movie in a theater until I was in college.
<1> No i can't speak it due to the face that my Parents cannot 
<1> I'm allergic to them too, maybe we will get a hairless one!
<0> Yes that's what I was thinking. I mean,  couldn't she have at least went somewhere more private!
<1> I wish I had work right now. I've been unemployed for six months.

<0> sounds like you have the perfect job ! i am trying to open a restaurant .
<0> I never thought of owning a boat or any other watercraft. It seems to be too much of a hassle.
<1> No I don't know any vets. In fact I feel that their work is overstated and that they don't do much to help animals.
<1> i have never worked at all
<0> I just take it that I did something for God,  I hope he rewards me 
<0> They sound very fancy. I don't think I've ever owned a pair of blue shoes.
<0> See this is why you are dope to hang out with. TV, Food, and Music
<1> yeah they are cool and they cost over 30k so you would need to open a big bank check

<1> No. I'm very confident to walk on the beach

<0> i agree! I actually wanna learn surfing 
<0> I am really surprised but overall impressed really.
<1> I understand, Hawaii is kind of ugly anyway.
<0> Oh I don't want any kids. I think I will just adopt some
<0> do you like to read

<0> Last time I checked, I am a girl!
<1> That's too bad work is like that for you. I've never had that problem. 
<0> I wasn't aware that drug use during pregnancy was a factor. This is a really sad statistic. Do they know what type drugs are most likely to cause this?
<0> I have way too may cats.
<1> I also hate bungee jumping
<0> I prefer trucks
<0> Very interesting. Is there a larger population in the States now than there has been in the past?

<0> Once in a while I sneak a bite of steak from my wife's plate.

<0> He owns a local insurance company.  I am so envious of him.
<1> i love the book 1984 i have read it many times
<0> I only have one daughter.
<0> Yeah, I guess it is. I really think there isn't that much value in all the online learning thing though. Traditional is much better.
<0> Thanks! You should! Better now than tomorrow is my motto!
<0> because she thinks i am going to move with my dad , i miss him
<1> No way I'm from Canada too!
<1> Oh my! That is a big family. I bet they are crazy for chocolate milk shakes.  I am.

<0> No I have not seen that movie.
<1> i hate traveling on water so i can't captain a boat.

<0> I hate pasta, can't stand when my wife cooks it. 
<1> No idea. I wish to go to Paris and DC someday though.
<1> i love dancing, but i don't like to sing

<1> i wish i could afford to go to college , but it's too expensive right now .
<0> I have never used chalk before.
<0> My children love my dog! 
<0> I would think so. Whatever is not urban is considered rural, and actually in 2006, the year of the last census of population, the Canadian population living in a rural area was between 19% and 30% of the total population, depending on the definition of "rural" used.
<1> Yum! I know its kinda mean but I want to learn self defense in case my husband starts eating my food. Lol. 
<0> I guess you have to put in the time to be any good. Hopefully I'll get there someday! I have a baby which takes up a lot of time!!
<1> Hiking and drinking don't mix too well, but after the hike sitting around the campfire is another story.
<0> Worms are the tackle...it's what I use; I go fishing all the time!
<1> It is no big deal, I would definitely still be friends with them.
<0> Chocolate and bourbon whiskey are also used.
<0> i love spending time with my dog and cat .
<0> Thanks, used cars are my preference, I would never be able to pay full price for a car
<0> do you like to read ?
<1> i hate watching netflix, i prefer to be outdoors!
<0> Do you have any favorite South Park Episodes?
<0> It was a supervisory position
<0> I think beer is a bad investment and won't be profitable.
<1> Wow,  did he buy anything cool?
<1> Agreed, fantastic show
<0> His job is to provide extra run protection or extra pass protection
<0> The origins are a little vague. But it's believed that it dates to pre-vedic times around the 5th or 6th century BCE.
<1> I agree, I also dislike theathers and watch more Netflix movies at my home too
<1> i have always wondered what people taste like .
<0> Yes I think so! I just bought some new clothes and I feel like a million bucks. 
<1> You shouldn't feel at peace and should not have gone to the family reunion
<1> I agree these type of cars are not reliable at all
<0> it will be the best cake ever
<1> My parent's bought more houses than they could afford, and they ended up being fine. 
<0> Yes,  my roomie had used the toilet and neglected to flush.
<1> That actually sounds delicious! I'll have to try that some time, I could use some burgers myself right now.
<0> I heard about the spin off as soon as they announced it, so couldn't wait for it!!
<0> it always reminds me of when they were little
<0> I've had so much spaghetti that I don't even want to see it anymore. Not a fan anymore.
<1> I'd like another Golden Retriever since they are really good with kids. My daughter really wants one also.
<1> I hate meat and sausage in my pizza.
<0> Wow I definitely understand your reasons now for wanting to be a chef. 
<0> I don't miss my grandma because we didn't do much together.
<0> Yeah it is! My favorite Corvette is actually the C3 which was made from 1968 to 1982.
<0> i'm familiar with german , but everyone here speaks spanish
<1> Oh, OK then, suit yourself. I seen the moon on my way back and it looked very real.
<0> I have a little bit hate it because it is too crowded.
<0> I always make sure to get everything needed.
<0> Did they hurt the pets?
<1> wow, big dreams. that would be a nightmare for me because i hate building anything haha
<1> Books are for losers, I just stick to TV and movies personally.
<1> The Death Eaters are not scary at all though.
<0> I hate big dogs but surfing is cool
<0> I hate dogs. I prefer cats.
<0> Wow, I would never think of a lifeguard on a mountain!  Are there many EMS's that also do lifeguard work, as well?
<0> oh, ive used bows. I have a short bow im using to teach my kids and my younger sisters to use
<0> do either of them still play pro ball?
<1> but not Chinese food because it is too greasy
<0> That has to be true, a 50% divorce rate is insane to really think about
<0> Have you seen the great British baking show? 
<0> sounds good! my pet stays at my room, it's in the basement but pretty comfy
<0> The pulitzer prize is an award for achievement in newspaper.
<1> but there is no plenty of time to get to know each other for you
<1> totally off topic, but have i told you how much i like to read
<0> No. Its been storming all day.
<0> That's gross... a little bit like my ferret, they have a weird smell.
<0> I prefer flour.
<0> i love veggies ! however , my sons , jacob and tyler do not like to eat their veggies
<0> i do not have a car though
<0> He unexpectedly decided to make me a painting of myself with crayons. It was pretty funny.
<0> not really. 
<1> Really? I hate reading.
<0> Safety is second, fun is first. I would rather people have fun then worry about safety.
<0> Not really, If the animal is unsuited for this purpose it can always be used as a house pet for a household. 
<0> Thanks! I can't stand thieves! I work hard for the things I have!
<0> I don't have a favorite restaurant because I don't eat burgers. 
<0> I don't really like Starbucks, but my friends like to go there.
<0> I do not fancy soccer. i prefer American football.
<0> I like really hot showers in the summer. It helps me unwind.
<1> oh perfect humor can change the world for the better .
<1> don't worry there's always another chance
<0> yep . oh and some jerky .
<1> Oh no! How does that make you feel?
<1> I think it's normal to feel that way. Historically, only children have been pretty uncommon. Usually you'd be in a big family with lots of siblings.
<1> Oh. I understand it. I think you friend will understand it. That what friendship is.
<1> I don't want to. I don't think 2 weeks of dating is long enough.
<0> I have also heard that many people use debt as a mean to purchase items that are not possible with the cash on hand. I know that is an approach that I have taken.
<0> Eh. The week will probably fly by.
<1> I don't know, I hate basketball. I coach football.
<0> I hope so I'm just so overwhelmed right now
<0> Oh really? I've actually been skydiving over Paris, great view!
<0> I have just joined an advocacy group that is enlightening people about how they should treat animals so I am hoping thing will change 
<1> I grew up in Detroit, Michigan. Moved to Washington DC about 10 years ago.
<0> Yes, it's like pizza on a roll, but not like hot pockets because the pizza part is on top of the bread rather than inside. What is your favorite food?
<0> You used was as in past tense.
<0> I don't get ill at all from eating sushi. I've never had any kind of negative response.
<1> It's a book series providing an historical account of the Battle of Hastings.
<1> I wouldn't know, I don't go to Canada.
<0> It can be difficult, but you should give it another shot now that you're older. It was nominated for a Carnegie Medal after all.
<1> can't really complain to anyone because you sound ungrateful so just say thanks
<1> Yeah. Thankfully my work is stress free and I don't have to work overtime, otherwise it would have been so much more difficult.
<1> That's rude of her, she didn't feel bad at all.
<0> i don't want to eat a meal and i hate pepper.
<0> I saw a snake in my backyard and i didn't killed it
<1> I'm from San Francisco now.
<0> It was! I was thankful we did so much in anticipation for the hurricane!
<0> Definitely the Jets! Things get fierce between those two.
<1> 11 years seem like a small period of years for working for such a company with such culture.
<0> Japan has a crazy work ethic. Their government recently passed laws to restrict work hours, i think.
<1> I hate old TV shows. I'd rather watch reality TV.
<0> I wonder how teams decide on their names; sometimes they just change them out of nowhere - or move teams to other cities, like the Chargers.
<0> Yea, I just don't like music though. 
<1> Am Went to Australia
<0> I like the Dark Tower series but I only read the first one. The Dune miniseries was pretty good.
<0> They were pretty stuck up, actually.
<0> I know it’s important I’m just not interested in learning about it
<0> Yeah,  just doesn't feel like there's much to offer her. I'm also not living close,  so I can only have phone conversations with her,  which,  again,  doesn't offer much. She's a good person,  so I hate to see her so bent out of shape
<0> I do tennis on occasion. I haven't golfed in a long time! We need to catch up one day and play a couple holes together!
<1> I hear you I don't like to cook either
<1> Does it smell like a Cheeto too?
<0> Oh I tell him very regularly but it would be nice to do so face to face. 
<1> I've never lived in New York
<1> I hope that you can find a solution to help with that. Good luck!
<0> That sounds awesome!  What is your favorite station?
<0> I feel more comfortable doing things I'm familiar with and I'm satisfied with it
<0> I have two kids and they also like to spend time outside. 
<1> i love podcasts that can give me good recipes
<1> Most people, including myself, develop vision problems when they are an adult.
<0> It's not that tasty.
<0> Is red not one of the primary colors? It reminds me of a vampire. 
<0> I know, it's been way too long since we've enjoyed lunch together.  When are you leaving on your trip?
<0> I hope so.  I have a liver disorder that we thought was under control with medication,  but my health just took a nose dive,  so it is all up in the air.
<1> i hate the color blue
<0> My favorite would have to have been going camping. Every summer we would got to different state parks and camp for a week. I loved it.
<0> Hip hop developed during the late 1970s, so recent! I would say around 5 years
<0> It was kind of like Shaun of the Dead but only Indian style. Did you ever see that one? It was a British film.
<0> No. My dog eats any food available to her so it's pretty believable.
<1> Nah, I don't really like music and dancing.
<0> That sounds like a really easy and simple job.
<1> I really hate it here Missouri, I'm thinking about moving back to Chicago
<1> I don't think you need to get her a gift as thank you, she is family its natural for her to help
<0> we had to read for 30 mins a day in 8th grade . do you do that ?
<0> It is honestly especially when you have to work in the morning 
<0> true that, I am already so thin
<0> I am still coughing a lot
<0> No I've never been there since I don't like Italian food at all.
<0> yes . it is very relaxing . do you watch golf and tennis on tv ?
<0> powderpuff for the win dude
<0> good one ! i am an app developer . i think they can heal our world .
<0> That sounds yummy. DO you know how much cheese people consume daily around the world? 
<0> Well, not really. I only met her one time when I was very little, so I barely knew her.
<0> You're kidding!  That is so cool.  Who invented them, I think I know the name...it's on the tip of my tongue...?
<1> I do actually quite a few mainly old country songs like daddys hands is a big one super oldie! 
<0> The gills don't do anything.
<1> I love it when a dog craps!
<0> No idea but it makes me feel very unappreciated.
<0> yessss, i love it. I listen to hiphop songs almost eveyday.
<0> It is actually in The Wizarding World of Harry Potter.
<1> I'm a vegetarian.
<0> I don’t know. Today I was busy working at home for the whole day.
<1> I have never worked for one before.  I don't really care much for animal welfare.
<1> That's so nice of you to do that for her. I have two dogs and they're picky too.
<0> yep.  like that old joke goes, politicians and journalists should wear jumpsuits like NASCAR drivers, with patches from all their "sponsors" lol
<0> lol its about over now
<1> thank you , both my parents are doctors . yes i do
<1> Oh I've never tried those. I normally don't bake at all.
<0> I think i got that perspective down!
<0> I'm not much of a macho guy myself.
<0> I don't want her leaving the house to quickly I'll miss her 
<0> That's true, they can fit a lot more people than most cars so families really reap the benefits
<0> Yeah, I learned Auto cad in my college and good in designing space models.
<0> It's a 1968 chevrolet.
<0> I know!  Thanks!  We really want this home!  It would be perfect for us.
<0> Awww,  congrats!  I absolutely love having a niece. 
<0> what a cool name , i bet he is so cute
<0> Yeah just be kind that all you can do
<0> I agree, but the crunch wrap supreme from taco bell is my favorite!
<0> i don't allow my brother to drive my car as he is poor in driving
<0> Yes, hope that I can get in touch with a plumber soon.

<1> I have never been to California. 
<0> Yes, they own the farm!
<0> I also have a younger brother and sister .
<1> I don't understand how, whenever they go at it it is super boring.
<0> We were quite furious,  he was mad I wouldn't pass him the puck.
<0> really, they are marked victories since the ancient times
<0> Don't be sorry...just bring something fun to the table!
<0> Do he play a lot of nightclubs or one specific one?
<0> It's because they can be very territorial fish!
<0> The profession has been around since the frontier days when the judges used to ride horseback with groups of lawyers.
<0> I am still yet to give birth to children.
<1> I feel the elderly have no respect for younger generations which is why I do not have respect for elderly people.
<0> Because the trucks are gas guzzlers so they brought them down since they cost so much for gas.  There are 3 Ford divisions in North America
<1> I am lucky I don't have to work because I inherited a lot of money and can afford anything I want
<1> True if you don't exercise we the kind of food we take,one can easily be obese
<1> yes , love it . great band .
<0> No,  i stood up quickly. But it was pretty embarrassing experience to have honestly
<1> seems like you have a lot of time on your hand
<1> Oh I make plenty of money, I'm a stock broker. 
<0> they are sometimes dangerous to strangers
<0> Nothing today. I've been on the road driving since I woke up this morning, and I just got home. 
<0> I think I understand the craze about Anime, everybody wants to know more about it, and It was just last month I knew it was Japanese cartoons
<0> They really have!  I was standing in the aisle looking at all the options and it just hit me,  I don't have Legos all over my living room floor anymore.  Talk about crying in the middle of Walmart because your kids have outgrown Legos!
<0> I wouldn't dare trying it.
<1> i hope you have a good evening . good luck in selling cars
<0> We don't have crocs, just alligators
<0> Well, I'm thinking about going into investment banking.  That's what my dad does.  BUT, you don't get much exercise.
<1> Oh wow thats awesome! Seems like a pretty chill job
<1> do you like pets ? you should
<0> Oh definitely. I had trouble handling the thing at first anyway, can't imagine how hard it would be if it was heavier.
<1> No, she works the day shift so she and I can watch Game of Thrones together - we never miss an episode!

<0> my favorite color is green 
<0> I like most kinds of music except country.
<1> Hope you had a good birthday.
<0> Yeah i hate them , they will never bring anyone sucess.
<1> NO, THAT NEVER HAPPENED TO ME, BECAUSE I DIDN'T SPEND THAT MUCH TIME AWAY FROM HOME.
<0> Surfing sounds like fun. It's better than playing with my dolls. So boring.
<1> No, I like blonds.
<1> We recently divorced, and now i am working like a maniac
<0> oh my . are you happy with that decision ?
<0> Interestingly, the format of Dancing With the Stars has been  licensed to over 42 territories!  That's quite an accomplishment!
<1> Star Trek is overrated. I hate watching it
<1> I try to avoid sugar at any cost. I even don't take a banana or apple
<0> Yeah the Halo is the big weapon that the aliens and humans are battling for control over. Part of why I like the video game is the rich storyline.
<0> Am not interested at all, it takes time
<0> I don't go to movies, they are too expensive and I don't have time for them.
<0> She deosn't think she is, but she is humble. She takes class 6 days a week.
<0> Yeah,  that's what I was thinking. It was in a neighborhood so hopefully some kid found it and can buy something he always wanted.
<0> Yeah they have. I listened to their first record in 1972
<0> I am sad that my mother forced me to leave my boyfriend.
<0> Reading doesn't keep the mind fresh
<1> Me either. I live off the grid without electricity or running water.
<0> i enjoying drawing and riding my bike . you ?
<1> And you can even cook through chemistry without heat such as cooking fish with the acids of lemon or lime juice.
<1> I would too. I also wish I had more time to read comics.
<1> That is pretty unfortunate. You should be like me and just buy them,  always easier when someone else does the work.
<1> I do as well. Hondas and Toyotas all the way. Brands like Ford, Jaguar, Chevy and GM are garbage cars.
<0> Oh that looked pretty bad, I'm not sure the commercial really gave away enough about the show, I prefer to not be suprised when I'm watching something
<0> what about raw onions do you like that
<1> I don't really like being outside
<0> I hope so!  Drowning is the worst way to die in my opinion!
<1> I'm having an awful day today.
<1> I don't like that idea, people should be allowed to harm the environment. 
<1> I hope they tell you that you didn't get the job.
<0> Yes, more than I can count haha. I guess it can be good and bad
<0> i like to read as a hobby also
<0> That is very interesting - I wish there was a simple answer to those of us who can't sleep well.
<1> I know. I've been there a few times this year
<0> I love my job as well.
<0> No, they just formed their group last month. 
<1> I agree. There are many characteristics that are important
<0> Yes it really does. He talks to her everyday and tells her everything and even asks for her advice.
<0> i volunteer at the animal shelter . its where i got my four cats lol
<0> I was so ashamed and felt so bad. She was very special to me.
<1> It sounds like you would make a good lawyer then.  It's all about the practical application of legal theories and following the rules.  Maybe you can go for it!
<0> I don't like cats but I do like my only pet which is a dog. 
<1> yes so is rap for me . believe it or not
<0> That's true. You know, cosmetics usually smell pretty good, but the FDA specifically excludes soap from being listed as a cosmetic. I found that pretty interesting.
<0> It is only 10 miles driving. I hope I can just go and nail the whole interview,  leaving the whole crew impressed with my skills
<1> That's great. My parents are lawyers so I might want to be a lawyer
<0> Well it's a good skill to have so you should learn!
<0> Yes, Mattel sure is a large company.
<0> They are the worse players I have ever seen, actually.
<0> I wish I had a dog. Right now I don't own any pets
<1> Well it's not so bad because I have my dog alive and well here with me to keep my spirits up!
<0> I'm also too shy to look at myself in the mirror, 
<1> Is it priced well?
<1> I don't really like being outdoors!
<0> i like looking at paintings .
<1> Its not any worse than the common cold
<0> There were a few left but they had devoured most of them. I really liked those flowers!
<1> I'm glad that you feel so helped out by the gifts! It's not a very fun and exciting time, I don't envy you for having a baby at all.
<1> Same here. I have never been to college either.
<1> I hope time will heal,  and they don't lose hope.
<0> Does Mexico have a huge population?
<0> i think you should see the world before you settle down . australia is great
<1> No way, I'm scared of horses.
<0> Yeah, but my son still takes up a lot of my time.
<0> I don’t like her movies.
<0> you hate vegetables that much ?
<0> No, not very often. I think blue jello is the closest thing to candy that I eat. 
<1> That makes more sense.  Is she still coming out with new music now?
<0> you have to stand up for yourself
<0> It is just for leisure. I can't wait!
<0> In 2009 Italy requested that Neapolitan pizza (thin crust pizza) was registered with the EU as a Traditional Specialty Guaranteed dish, which means a pizza can't be called Neapolitan unless it's made in Italy.
<0> ok friend defiantly here after i wll try that games  
<1> Oh, well.  Maybe it is best if you don't get the job then.
<1> Yes - that  would not be a job I'd like. 
<0> The 1930s was one time when government intervention was very helpful, with the passing of entitlement programs in the New Deal.  Things like Social Security, and Farm Security Administration.
<1> do me 
<1> Just clowns! 
<1> That's really cool! I love watching basketball with my family!
<0> well , that'sn't fun !
<1> i can imagine . i love working with animals . i am also the local theater company .
<0> I love to cook Indian food since my father was from India.  I also love to bake cakes and cookies.

<0> I went shopping today and met my friends they are coming over for dinner tonight. 
<0> me too but we are not expecting good news
<0> I would dance so well to it.
<1> Nobody is nice these days
<1> I understand. As a CEO of a big business, I don't have much time for a family.
<0> i know i have 23 ! i pick up 1 every time i travel !
<1> i'm feeling a little judged .
<0> I know right? Durant also used the Chevrolet Motor Car Company to acquire a controlling stake in GM.
<1> Yes, it's hard.to keep up with 24 grandkids.
<1> Yeah why don't you have it delivered, I'm not a big fan of pizza myself.
<0> that is cool i don't know who that is
<0> i also enjoy playing the violin . do you play anything ?
<0> great , i want you to pay for it though
<1> I would like to try tennis someday.
<0> Yes, it was a blast only wearing pajamas at the movies.
<0> A bunch of star wars toys and some legos as well!
<0> It plot lines are limited with little cast.
<1> Wow you must be really smart. I hear that's really hard
<0> mmm, that does sound delicious!
<1> I never find any interesting music at goodwill.
<1> You might regret going back to school so late in life.
<1> I've tried Destiny 2.
<1> I think that's a waste of your money, you should use it for something other than games.
<0> That's life I guess. I ended up moving in with some people I still talk to though.
<0> Yes! We love to watch Sound of Music on Thanksgiving evening.  
<1> by business was low too when i first moved to Washington 3 year back, but with time it got better. so give yours time  
<0> It is,  you have never heard of it?
<0> that's a great job , i just work at an office in my city
<0> i love magic . there's a great magician at venice beach . have you been ?
<0> Well at least you have a sister, I wish I had siblings. It's lonely being an only child.
<0> I saw the Northern Lights on a family vacation a long time ago. It is awesome. You definitely have to see it.
<0> Where I'm from, Wales, there are a lot of redheads. We're concentrated in the same general area.
<1> Haha,  yea thats how I feel about my In laws.  Im glad they are a 4 hour plane ride away
<0> True but I am so busy I don't think I will ever find the time to clean.
<1> testing or developer?
<0> oh , great ! what kind of concert ? what kind of music ?
<1> You would be surprised by how much of that you could find in Mexico. Mountains are beautiful there.
<0> No, I don't like loud noises at all.
<1> I don't think I like it, I feel its complicated. 
<1> i love to swim to
<0> wow , you must love fishing .
<1> I'm not too concerned about how much the company is being charged. They already make enough money. There are many different health care organizations in the US.
<0> one day i will be able to run real fast like i could when i was younger .
<0> Obviously! I already knew what a prefecture was.
<0> what is your career ? do you have any favorite foods ?
<0> no it is small i have some cats . four of them .
<0> i like very much that one.
<1> I don't think a degree in nursing  is any important achievement, so that should sound like a big achievement!
<0> I've seen larger results. lost 30 pounds in 2 months eating right and jogging
<0> I doubt I will learn anything. I am already wise enough
<0> i bet. have you adopted many yourself? i'm sure it must be hard not to take them all home!
<0> You are right. I will write a letter to my doctor
<0> Nice i am from canada also but i am from the west, vancouver soecfically.
<1> Might be better to get another dog as soon as possible to help you get over the other dog
<0> I know that.  My father was a butcher and he taught me everything about it.
<0> I love the Cavatappi! They are my favorite tools to make my art with. They name literally means corkscrew in Italian. 
<1> Yeah, but I'm really proud of the Bachelor's degree I earned last year.
<1> Most driver are exceptional and careful when driving. 
<1> i think you'll love that more
<0> I'd prefer a techno song. I don't like melodic music much.
<0> It's not bad, I stay alert by drinking lots of Coke. My favorite, I hate tea and coffee.
<1> I think robots are fascinating!
<1> Ive ran a couple marathons can't wait to get back out there and do another one
<0> interesting. I've also heard they shed copiously particularly at the change of seasons
<1> I don't know why you're going to disney world if you want to have fun though, that place is nothing but a stress magnet.
<0> I listen to the radio..
<0> Yes,  it's the only time we get to meet our brothers and sisters ,  nieces and nephews because everyone is on holiday :)
<0> i doesnt say thats at all
<0> Lol...it'll be less likely to happen this year. I've gone full vegan and there's not a lot of vegan candy being given out!
<0> Well in the song Rainbow the first color is purple and the last color is red.
<0> Very true.  They probably make a great deal of money selling the concentrate for soda fountains in restaurants.
<0> No, my eyes are blue...blue like the sky on a cloudless day.
<1> No not really, I only just started learning a few weeks ago so I'm quite lost. 
<1> I work at a fast food place right now. Probably why I eat too many fries!
<1> No, I drunk milkshake only.
<0> I do know that costs around $100,000 to $400,000 minimum.  It depends on how much land you purchase or rent, but you can figure out the cost by acre and the the cost to prep the land and use equipment.
<1> I did not like the farm,I hate it
<1> You should just do it yourself.
<1> You know, I think traipsing around old ruins in the hot sun would be deadly dull.
<0> I love it. People always give me big tips for being such a great waiter. I never forget their orders.
<1> I love it and I'd go sailing more often if I lived closer to the ocean
<1> Me either, I eat it, at most, once a month.
<0> I don't drink soft drinks or anything carbonated 
<1> I think it is a good thing that she is not paying you back. It is a good lesson for you.
<0> In fact I do eat fish as I am allergic so I would not know how good it is.
<0> That sounds super fun! I may have to go buy that game.
<0> i wanted to go fishing with the family
<0> I never eat chocolate. It upsets my stomach.
<1> Whatever you do don't take any chances with people. You can't trust them! 
<1> Yes, I majored in Electrical Engineering and am now teaching as a professor at a university. 
<1> That's cool. I don't think I'd want to own a bow - sounds dangerous.
<1> I have no money to go on Vacation so I probably will never leave this town. 
<1> Not me, I haven't even thought about college yet. 
<0> I didn't know that so they can plan my whole trip not just the plane or transportation part I wonder how much I have to pay them though.
<1> what do you do for work ?
<0> they're not good parents
<0> I know, that's why I am relieved that she forgave me immediately and was not upset.
<0> Sled racing is interesting, it seems dangerous for the dogs though.
<0> I never swam for any team, but I did run track at one point.
<1> I like to read books in my free time.
<0> Yes, Tattoos are very new actually. They came after George Bush's presidency.
<0> Because I never expected her to get pregnant so young.
<1> Yes I liked the 70s models but loved what they did to the 90s models.
<0> They were really influential. I always considered them having more to do with the punk scene, though. Haven't really gotten very dep into their evolution, I have to admit.
<0> I have a big decision to make. Any other advice to help me decide?
<0> It is like water skiing but on a board!  It is fun,  but a little nerve racking!
<1> Stealing is actually not bad
<0> Yeah, I really love working for this company and I will never leave anytime

<0> i love having fun with my family . we are free spirits .
<1> dogs do circus tricks too
<0> Yeah whats your favorite combination of foods
<0> I think I will go to McDonald's to buy 50 Big Macs to really infuse it with that nasty,  greasy smell of despair.
<1> I absolutely love pizza and sushi. The bloat is worth it!
<0> Everything they report on is propaganda that is pushed by Bloomberg. In face in 2016 they did an article on Fake news and admitted they have to stretch the truth sometimes. 
<0> No, I ended up meeting up with them later in the night.
<1> Its not flattering for your man to be good looking.
<1> That is a respectable build, would prob be worth money now a days. 
<1> I have a husky, he's the cutest. 
<0> I do, but only baseball...football or basketball are boring to me.
<1> I understand that! I'm a teacher so I have the summer off. Where do you work?
<0> What else is going on with you?
<0> Lots of Ja Rule and Nelly. Talk about a long time ago. Felt like I was in high school again.
<0> ive never travelled outside the country, id love to sometime 
<0> I began two years ago and only do yoga now.
<0> During the 8th century, Chinese artists used cobalt blue to color blue and white porcelain
<1> just my son . what do you do in your spare time ?
<1> dont worry every thing will be ok. just keep your self on
<0> Oh I would never even think of traveling to New York
<1> I wish I lived near a park. The closest one is way on the other side of town.
<1> I'd have to let my husband know, as I'm a woman.
<0> Yes I did, zebras were the only ones that came up. I was on a cruise ship that toured down africa.
<0> Sure does, but I would much prefer to eat a scone.
<1> Not yet. I need to find a new job. Stuck in a Factory for now. Doesn't pay very well.
<0> You would definitely enjoy a Chicago deep dish pizza.
<0> Yea the states are good, but I like it here in Africa.
<1> it is a pathetic situation
<1> i've a hard time parallel parking but the other parking i can do well .
<0> Very hard to recreate for sure. I am terrible at painting and drawing. 
<1> You shouldn't change your way of thinking, just be yourself and if she likes you, she likes you!
<0> I know, I saw when I stayed there.
<0> I can not read my bible sometimes when I am busy.
<0> I think I've chosen my genre thanks to you. I am going to write a mystery novel. I appreciate your help and insight.
<0> Thats a a good thing.I can imagine life without my cat.Do you have odgs?
<1> Let's play
<0> Was burger time in 1987? Or was that the actual restaurant, not sure if I've played it but totally get the concept. Same here 
<0> Aw that's so sweet! I have a little at home too!
<1> You should be careful sometime its not much enjoyment in such parties.
<0> Very! and they refused to give me a discount.  Last time I'll order from there again.
<1> I would not like a job at a casino. Dealing with all the drunks!
<1> Im in Montana and was thinking dirt biking would be awesome this weeken
<0> We are the opposite. I work while my husband stays home with the kids.
<1> I was a gymnast growing up so I have amazing balance.
<1> I think that he is equally talented. He can just make a person feel strong emotions through his craft. It really is amazing. Can you think of anyone today that is of his calibur?
<1> I like most seafood but shrimp really puts me off.
<1> Yeah it is, I went with my dog and he was going crazy from the heat.
<0> There are some disadvantages however.  They can be topheavy, which can affect handling. 
<0> Oh, I can't sing a single note and I hate sports.
<1> the girls and i go horse back on weekends it helps train the dogs
<0> I did,  I ended up getting another job I wanted,  but I was pretty bummed about losing the other one. The commute would have been much nicer.
<0> Wow that is a long time I know its the most popular home delivery food in the world
<0> No,  haha not traumatized but happy to move in to a real apartment once we had enough money saved,  haha. 
<0> Yeah it was, I didn't have to cook for the 3 days they brought us food.
<0> That place sounds terrible.
<0> I prefer blues to metal though somehow related.
<1> that is horrible!
<0> I am about to go here soon.
<0> The same town but the house is much nicer and everything inside is new.
<1> Yeah but i wonder what Spain would be like
<0> do you have to have really good grades to do something like that ?
<1> It's about drama and love
<1> None. I find dancing boring and a waste of time.
<1> Great I prefer movies alone it's the best
<0> you remind me of one of my four sons , you should try life is about chances !
<0> I really like cute shoes. There was one pair I was usually fond of but one of my 2 cats ruined it.
<0> I hate doing anything that involves leaving my home
<0> no.literally anyone could do it. you just pick up garbage. it's not as easy as teaching, im sure, buts ittakes no skill
<1> Yeah, Vegas isn't a great place to take a vacation.
<1> Oh I love those. They always have great selections and the desserts aren't bad either.
<0> Nobody asked if you have any dolls who cares?
<0> Yes,  I will be staying right downtown.
<0> No, I clean for a living.
<1> That sounds great, though I don't really like the Stones, but you guys are fun!
<0> seventeen years and i can not wait to go on my honeymoon
<0> Of course, with the pros comes the cons.
<0> I have a lot of dogs but no cats.
<0> Yes they were big in the 2000s, I wonder if they still make music. 
<0> i love it,  i have bought it every year for the last 12 years
<1> The kitten might have been dehydrated.  Hopefully the neighbor called someone else to come help?
<1> how did the accident happen ?
<1> i love to sit on the couch and play video games myself
<0> Very proud! Especially as a trainee dentist!
<0> i imagine so . i live in the middle of not where with turtles as pets
<1> what school should i look into ? oops , dogs needed out
<0> Well it is certainly better than what the first internet users in 1552 had.
<1> Yes. I will be learning how to make pastry next year.
<0> There is no way I can make it to work on time.
<0> but health wise a normal human needs a holiday from work
<0> Is it any good town for a vacation?
<1> Yeah,she was already old and lived a fulfilling life so i don't feel sympathy for your loss at all.
<1> I couldn't agree more.  I have really enjoyed the time I've had with my children.
<0> I would rather be at home than in the mountains.
<1> Yes you should probably find someone to talk too.
<0> i hate spanish album.
<0> cool thats nice do you draw as well
<1> Me too, I wish I could work remotely.
<0> i am a sales representative. YouTube sucks 
<0> I am too and so were both of my parents.
<0> she ask me to come.
<0> yes , it requires an upper level of comprehension , i suppose .
<0> I would eat a McDonalds hamburger for lunch as I enjoy eating beef hamburgers.
<0> Like the show Puppy Dog Pals!  Bingo is my favorite!
<0> we dont do christmas concerts
<1> dog ? i have no dog . only three kids !
<0> i had a sprain in my neck but my car was ruined. i was really mad.
<1> I don't either, regular Coke all the way!
<0> I do not like cats
<1> Things are fairly conservative down here but there are also many weird cults in New Orleans.
<0> yes , i like bruno mars as well . . . especially the versace song .
<0> I also have a one year old. My twelve year old thinks hes "grown" because I'm not very tall and he is. Haha
<0> I see, that is a good idea. Have you traveled a lot before?
<0> Oh yeah that's a must! Gotta be safe out there!
<1> I like the Rolling Stones but my receptionist heard me listening to them and was mean to me.
<0> I do IT but only part time
<0> Not too often.  But that's ok, they lose alot.  Have a wonderful day. 
<0> Yum!  Well I would definitely want to try some of all of that:)
<1> i will give it a thought
<0> I love steacks and fries
<0> I bought a cake to make them forget about this.
<0> no I actually have a pet hamster.
<1> That's nice.
<0> sugar cane is a huge commodity and i like sugar
<0> No way, I could never own a gun they are so dangerous! 
<0> Yeah it's pretty much junk but it tastes so good!
<0> It takes me back to a special time.
<0> Whaaa, that is crazy, I would love to have a restaurant or chain pizzeria bring me pizza at the beach, that sounds like a wonderful time
<0> Her parents are pretty proud,  but I'm more joyful for her than anything!
<0> i am going to visit the usa as soon as i finish my degree . i am almost there .
<1> my wife really hates me
<1> Role Playing Games, you play team of warriors and develop them over time.
<1> I don't like Italy
<0> You can run 2.5 kms in 11 mins? That’s awesome!
<1> You should have not volunteered for it and gotten another job.
<1> i work out very often now
<1> No, I've actually never had any alcohol in my entire life.
<1> I wish I could have a dog, but I travel a lot and If I get a dog, it wil be alone for days in my house.
<0> I don't know anything about Tesla as a company. I don't even like cars.
<0> Was it? I haven't seen any episodes.
<0> Probably taste just like chicken as the joke goes
<1> I do. I am a Catholic myself.
<0> I guess I'll just have to wait on moving and get this reparation money first. 
<1> Yea it actually forms part of the Mexico–United States border, Most people dont even know that.
<1> My last dog was a golden retriever/lab mix.  I adopted her as a senior dog.
<0> No luckily the house was ok.
<0> You make a good point.   I want my kids to have actual memories, rather than pics on a cloud.
<1> I had a lot of fun too! I drank all the alcohol I could get my hands on and became dead drunk
<0> oh nice . that is important lol . lets get a drink
<0> I always am! They make it easy to relax
<0> why do you say that
<0> I agree with that. Not everyone can be helped.
<0> I remember my parents getting Sky tv in the 80's and we watched the first ever song played on there, Money for Nothing I think it was called by Dire Straits.
<0> your trophy case full of other gold medals or will this be the first.
<0> Yeah I can't stand it, and cooking in general is just not fun
<0> I don't have a dog! What gave you that idea?
<1> You're probably contagious with something. I hope you don't feel good enough to leave the house, so you can't infect others with whatever you've got.
<0> No, I actually like my job and have met some wonderful people there.
<0> That's awesome. I'm kind of lazy so I don't like fitness. I'd rather drive my car then work out.
<1> You should do better next time.
<0> I watch many lizard videos. Fewer antics than cats, but just as cute in their own way. 
<0> Yes they are , Do you care for one ?
<0> It really looked so gross!
<0> I graduated from Harvard Law 15 years ago

<0> We were lucky cause we didn't get any of the rain.
<1> I'm a loner.  I don't have a best friend.

<0> ok you're insisting, I can't prevent you
<1> Ugh, what a let down. So they gave you something that's just going to fall apart in a year? What a joke.
<0> great i would also try for it 
<0> I like thousand island dressing but I don't like vegetables.
<0> Yes! It was several years ago and when I look back on it I'm just like,  why did you do that mom? Lol. I couldn't see myself doing it as an adult
<0> I remember him being so frantic and out of place though when being provoked. Unlike Eric! 
<0> Sounds pretty cool, I haven't met a fellow Jew in quite a while so that's nice.
<0> As of 2018 the population is 623,657 but Burlington is the most populous city in the state.
<1> It is. But also traffic is crazy and it's a bit overpopulated. But the beauty makes it all worth it
<1> My high school sweetheart wants to go to Florida but I hate all that flat land. 
<0> That's an very good information i found it very informative. Thank you.
<1> he is a good singer . he is very popular here in the usa .
<0> do you know a good salon ? my hair is so hard to manage
<0> Sadly that diet dose not exist in nature. They do perform many important things for us such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and military, companionship and, more recently, aiding handicapped individuals and therapeutic roles. So we have to take care of them.
<1> I wish I had at least one. We would be able to spend alot of time together.
<1> Yeah, at least I don't have student loans, otherwise that would be a burden on top of the already existing problems.
<1> You don't have to do that. You don't have to do much to please her
<0> I know - I can't wait to get a third more cash in my hand every month!
<0> I was! My friends ditched me...I couldn't believe they would do such a thing.
<1> I don't have any dogs, sadly. I am allergic.
<1> Sometimes it is the best thing to deal with,you will miss it when it is all gone.
<1> I have read Canada have very naturally beautiful places to see during summer. I wish Summer Olympic Games to be held there after Brazil
<1> I mostly eat out, cooing can be so annoying
<1> Thanks. Do you have a job?
<0> A drug problem. It has been going on for years.
<1> Sometimes people carve leather, but it must be vegetable tanned, full grain leather to work it this way. 
<1> i hate it with passion
<1> Yeah me too. I don't have a job, so I play a lot of video games.
<0> Golden retrievers are terrible at retrieving ducks. You should get a different dog.
<1> i don't like pizza
<1> i do not know , lately i've been so sad , i think i need some help
<1> My dad and I have been hiking all day...just got back and it was not a good day!
<0> I usually go on our Tuesday break to buy one with coworkers.
<1> Yeah but I hate nature. I want to be somewhere complex and interesting.
<0> Yea. I'm so used to living in the center of the city. Nothing but cars and buildings. I already feel so relaxed here.
<0> I'm honestly thinking of just scanning them all into the computer.  But it's going to take some work,  especially since all I did today was cry at just about every photo of our girls when they were little.
<0> Dachsund. He's black with brown splotches.
<0> Yes,  I'm really looking forward to the new year.
<1> Or you could start smoking too, to make things simple for you, and it will stop bothering you.
<1> positive discipline model doesnt work anymore
<0> I would rather repair cars, than heal people. People annoy me.
<1> i am an adult . and she doesn't like me carping in the forest on weekends .
<1> my father preaches on sundays . he says the city is full of sin . . . is it ?
<1> Thats extremely interesting. Is there any suggested foods for this diet?
<1> Times Square was a lot of fun.  We ate at a restaurant right in there and got to look at all the billboards and advertisements all over.  It was too expensive to do often, though.
<0> I'm constantly on the move. I have to drive my car everywhere since there's no public transit where I live.
<0> Oh that's sad. They always have that issues with some of their clothes
<0> No I don't want to propose. It is too soon.
<0> but its not only for solution
<0> Yup 20 human years. My dog is a boy and he's currently six now. He's filled with energy! 
<1> Yes. None of my flying experiences have been scary though.
<0> Well, give em another chance, theyre kind of what you call...timeless
<0> Well,  someone I was conned into getting on one and before I knew it,  I was strapped in and could not get off.  I literally felt my heart stop.
<0> I'm learning to deal with it.  He passed away ten years ago tomorrow.
<1> Why don't we go to the pastry shop together and enjoy a sweet treat and a cup of coffee. We can have a nice chat and eat our favorite food.
<0> it is my absolute favorite to listen too while i cook
<1> I love mutts. someday I want to live on a farm with a whole herd of dogs if I could just get my life together.
<1> oh thats swwet, wished i have a brother too.
<1> I hate finishing books i start reading, i hate to read novels these days
<0> At the beginning of the film, the ducks are awarded scholarships to Eden Hall Academy, this was after they won the Junior Goodwill Games in Los Angeles.
<0> I found out today,  and it haunts me.
<0> I don't have one.  I don't really care for NASCAR.
<0> where do you work?
<0> I'll be in my bunker with my hoard of food and supplies!
<1> I guess it will kick in faster
<1> I was there on Monday, but it was raining so I had to leave but I don't care much about going there because there are too many kids.
<1> 35. I wish I was having a party, but I'm going out with friends.
<0> That seems to be interesting and soothing
<1> No, I have not but I sure plan to soon.
<0> you should . i guess people get annoyed that i worry about the less fortunate .
<1> That is too bad. I got some expensive french red wine. I could have bought a car for the price! haha
<0> Yeah I think it just scares me that you don't know what is in there. I got back in the pontoon as quickly as possible.
<0> Not yet,  but I think I'll just eat an apple.  Such a let down when I wanted something salty and tangy like chips and salsa. oh well.
<0> That's interesting! Do you happen to know when the first orphanage was created in America?
<1> They don't make comics. 
<0> I would say they have a close proximity with other Punk Rock bands but there's none specifically that are quite like them.
<1> They're quite the handful. I give each of them a packet of seeds for Christmas, so they can grow their own food.
<1> I'm glad you liked it, but that sounds pretty gross to me.
<1> Great, and that's my name!
<1> Yeah, I heard they are bad for the environment.
<0> i hear it's the most dangerous animal
<0> no , just them . it was lonely growing up . do you have siblings ?
<0> yes exactly. thanks for the understanding
<0> I have never been married before.
<1> i think we always have those things we regret in life
<1> Yeah but reading has its own proper ways that affect your brain to expand.
<1> They start of the season always feels so slow. I'd rather wait for the finals.
<0> What a coincidence, I also work as a chef!
<1> I already know how to fix cars and engines, so I wouldn't need those classes.
<1> It's not very popular in Canada.
<0> I have ten pets.
<0> i don't care for them .
<0> yeah, cause he undermined my work recently.
<1> I'm glad you're working. Work's always slow for me around now, that's why I don't like this time of year.
<0> i did not like to study about the ocean
<1> I hate dogs. I don't have a dog, and I never will have a dog.
<0> Yeah, they are good. I've baked chicken wings too. Both are great. 
<1> I don't have any pets since I hate animals.
<1> I used to love the old starfox games.
<0> I also know that tacos don't go well with breakfast
<0> For sure, when I go I do feel better about it. I will make up for it next week for sure!
<0> True, there are none native to where I live either. They are easy to spot with their vivid colors multicolored feathers.
<1> No, I am scared of flying.
<0> yes its great , you'll never be home i have a mansion
<1> I wish I had a puppy. I've always wanted one but never had one. 
<0> Wow! That's crazy. Wasn't there a Garfield movie recently too? 
<0> Yes i do, mostly bikes but also enjoy riding horses
<1> That's no good. You've got to make big deposits at once.
<1> Yes, you can get a Toyota Highlander 2005 version
<1> I should watch las Avengers to see the flash in action.
<1> it makes me not breathe well and sometimes my eyeballs fallout .
<0> Never tried that, maybe next time.  How many Starbucks do you have in Seattle?
<0> Yeah, it really is. I'm usually out and about so the few times that I get the chance to cuddle up I take it!
<0> What are other types of jokes that you know of?
<0> Yes! And it can last from 2 to 72 hours!
<0> I discover it today. I felt some anormal in that area then by touching I notice that skin was not normal.
<1> I've never had this problem, I've always had loads of friends.
<0> I had to find my lost buddy,  and nervous is an understatement.
<1> nice ! maybe when i'm older . now its disney movies for me .
<1> i like kevin because he seems down to earth but i hate kevin because he is so sarcastic
<0> I just had my first child a few weeks ago. I guess the distraction got to me and effected my performance.
<1> No worries, even if I'm not that interested in having to work, I can still appreciate those that do!
<1> Not too fast thought, because it will be awhile before they grow up.
<0> Next time I shop I will try Amazon
<1> What are you waiting for?
<0> Economics. I am hopeful I did well on it because I studied hard!
<1> I don't want to spend time on a boat, though.
<0> I've never been a fisherman so I don't know the pain
<0> i also, it applies to me, i better surrounds myself with friends than being single.
<1> That's nice. I have a pet dog. No cats though.
<0> Not anymore. Are you in college?
<1> I don't think you should've gotten involved, it's not very nice to impede another's happiness.
<0> yes two kids what about you
<0> That is interesting. I would love to learn how to play.
<0> Sure thing. Or maybe do an old classic movie together and enjoy a day of eating
<0> Though going there is a waste of time on my side because there will be no benefit at all and I  will spend some cash. 
<1> I don't really care about your problems, please don't tell me about them.
<0> No, I mostly know facts about yellow. Yellow is my favourite primary color.
<0> That is true but hopefully the money last a long time.
<0> no it is his second, and yeah he's going to do more.
<1> i have kids , so it pays the bills . ll
<0> Ew, beer is disgusting.
<1> i live in new york but i am originally for algeria
<0> Yes for sure. He said he was afraid to tell anyone all these years. 
<1> I don't want to leave this job, because I love my boss, he is very friendly and always lets us finish earlier if we want to
<0> anything with animals and ponies ! i draw pennies all over my 3 inch binder ! you ?
<0> Is it for flowers or for vegetables? I would grow vegetables but I know it would just feed the raccoons around here. 
<1> i tried it , i just buy booze .
<0> Well I don't think that is a good idea, the school has poor percentage on rankings!
<1> we have been together almost a year .
<0> Yeah, Taylor Swift is great.
<0> Really? I was thinking about getting my first ever tattooo one of these days actually.
<0> Hey that is a great idea. I want to visit Nashville. Have you?
<1> I think pizza is gross in general.  I feed it to my dog when my wife orders it.
<1> Wow, I hate video games. I find them boring and never play.
<1> Yeah I watched most of it. How about you?
<1> I do use headphones quite frequently actually.  I personally use Bose.  What is your favorite food?  Mine is pizza.a
<0> It's okay though since I have other shows that I like better.
<0> That is nice, I do not have any Kids
<1> I'll eat anything I'm not picky at all
<0> She got a scholarship to go to school abroad.
<1> Well I would go on the date then buy the kid a big present.
<0> The grass makes me itchy,  But the shower afterward feels great.
<1> i am not old,i used a large clubs.
<1> It's what my husband started doing for me after I retired.
<1> I actually don't play or watch football. I only play basketball.
<1> Wow. We go every 2 years to Canada. 
<0> cucumbers, beets, misc things but my favorite thing to pickle are eggs. My family just loves them.You ever try them?
<0> thats cool, I am finding it dificult to stay faithful to a diet plan
<1> Well, at least it was a stranger. It would've been way worse if you knew her. 
<0> I guess part of the frustration is because of dealing with the current passing of my father.
<1> Yeah. red is my favorite color too. I love it
<0> Thanks , but I saw them recently and mentioned that I was thinking about being a vegetarian and they were not happy with me 
<0> i teach at a middle school , 7th grade science .
<1> OK,  I find the whole topic boring
<0> I had the fiesta lime chicken.  It was a decent meal if I must say.
<1> My favorite fruit is apple.
<1> It really is. I do always lock my doors though and windows at night because I have heard of people trying to break in during the night.
<1> Yes, Verne was so prolific, that's why he's my favorite sci-fi author.
<1> well it is almost the same thing i do , sales . so i hear you
<0> nice . i guess they didn't hurt as much as i think they would 
<0> That can be a type of flourless cake. I enjoy any cake made without flour. Ever since i was diagnosed with celiac disease I've missed out on cake.
<0> They were even buried with their humans as long ago as 36,000 years ago
<0> Yup don't we all...but I was living at my parents' then and now I'm on my own,  fully self-employed. So I guess I'm officially an adult
<0> I really hate sports.
<1> Same. I avoid most forms of media, including video games. They are a waste of time.
<0> I hate sugary foods, they make my stomach hurt
<0> Definitely although I have to admit I'll be ordering Pizza Hut I hate say. Love Pizza Hut sauce.
<0> I was quite annoyed,  especially because it was unnecessary too.
<1> I actually don't mind teaching at the highschool. all the students are really nice
<1> People taht think you can be abducted are crazy

<1> I do not know, nobody smokes in my family
<0> Yeah I'm glad she's alive and healthy.
<1> oh yes im terrified of spiders, more than they are of us
<0> I know. I just don't understand why some people drink hot chocolate with wipped cream. It's disgusting.
<1> Is that why the lyrics don't make sense most of the time. 
<1> I don't need the help. I am always prepared.
<0> I hate cooking. I wish I could do something else
<0> Not sure what i missed out on by not going public, but my mother did great

<1> I'd like to go but I'm training for a marathon that goes through the city.
<1> Well then you should have returned them! If they looked bad that matters too!
<0> Yes I look both ways and never use my cell phone in the intersection. Sometimes I wish I wasn't soch a worry-wort.
<0> Its a social commentator william hazlitt
<0> I never saw that one!

<0> 6 weeks!  wow - how did you manage to be able to spend so much time?
<1> Thanks! I'm fine, honestly I'm so relaxed you have no idea.
<1> I'm getting the best grades this year in a poetry class.  I'm flunking Biology and I can't stand the thought that I'll have to go to summer school because of it.
<1> oh yeah . cheese plate frank sinatra playing , and watching spongebob on mute , perfect
<0> Scooby Doo is one of my favorites. I've watched it since I was a kid. Tom and Jerry is really funny, too
<0> Huh.  That's interesting.  I wonder if there's a way to adjust to the other way or if you'll always tend toward one or the other no matter what you do.
<0> Yes we met in the classroom as students. My name is parrot so when I told him that it obviously grabbed his attention.
<0> I have 2 dogs. I don't have cats. What about you ?

<0> marketing , i love it so much .
<0> I hate dogs, though. They are the worst.
<1> That sounds so good!
<1> I agree!  It is one of the top public recreational activities - in some countries swimming lessons are mandatory!
<1> Don't worry about it, just be yourself. Don't look up any dating advice or watch videos, you'll just overthink it.
<0> Yeah Twilight is one of my least favorites
<0> Yeah it was Ride the Lightning by Metallica,  which made it even more impressive because it's a very technical and fast song.

<0> I always buy my stuff full price i hate sales 
<0> so cool , i'm a vet

<0> Oh I love to shop online, the magic of the being able to buy anything and everything with just a few clicks is amazing. 
<0> I think my church group would think the same, I'll tell them when I go Sunday.

<0> Yes,  she is going to college,  she wants to be a vet.  I have such big dreams for her,  but I think she has even bigger for  herself.
<0> Yeah,  which is fine if we were just friends,  but we're significant others and we plan to get married,  so it's kind of worrisome that after years being together that we're not better at communicating,  or at least working through an argument. It's hard for us to put aside our personal feelings and be objective,  but only when it's with one another,  for some reason.
<0> and they think it is old and throw it away .
<0> Have you ever hiked? I wish I could walk
<0> Is there anything else about Barbie you can tell me?

<1> its a concert . my mom won't take me .

<1> I hate sushi. Can we try to find a different restaurant online?
<0> Can we change the subject? This topic bores me!
<1> I sure nothing helps to reduce the stress and strain.
<0> Well they have plummeted back down so you can get in pretty cheap again,  but it might not be a good idea at this point.
<0> I have kids but I wish I had pets too.
<1> Maybe you should come here! The weather has been decent since hurricane season just ended.
<1> I don't know what a vacation is.
<0> I don't have any rocks yet. I really need to start collecting some soon.
<0> I am helping plan a surprise party at my house for her. 
<1> How about cows? Do you have any? I love a fresh grass fed steak lol
<1> There are stores that less people are in and dont crowd alot. Also have you tried online shopping?
<0> yes . absolutely , bring your cats .
<0> Indeed. It would be interesting to watch for time to come. Criminal investigation coming to conclusion and what to do about Strzok and his thug evildoing. 
<0> Definitly,  I will need lots of water since it hot here.  Any other tips?
<0> I think they look completely ridiculous. Who'd ever want one? 
<0> I did and I am pretty sure that I aced it!

<0> yea. very true. i stayed in paris for 10years. met my first love there also.
<0> Oh, I've never heard of that

<1> That's good to hear! I hate being up late, so it's been a little unpleasant for me.
<0> Nothing in particular,  I just get a bad feeling about them
<0> I lost my faith also, but I found it again.
<0> Yea she also loved wearing blue
<0> I hate sushi. How can anyone eat raw fish? 
<1> It's not the kind of food that I would eat.
<1> i played football and basketball in college and i wouldnt trade that experience for the world 
<1> That's really neat. I've never done much with technology. Do you like it? 
<0> When did you go?
<1> Zero. I prefer to watch at home on my own TV
<0> I really am.  It was so much hard work,  I must celebrate.
<1> I don't know I haven't tried it.
<0> No,  but I had let my dog out before I left and then forgot to let him back in and now he's gone. I feel horrible!
<0> Now you're making me hungry. I have some beef I need to cook. A chefs gotta eat you know...
<0> he Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. It's a collection of 35 governments and the organization was founded to stimulate economic growth and trade. It also takes account of literacy.

<1> I've never had a casino.
<1> I'm worried my parents won't approve because she's rude and rough around the edges.

<1> You're welcome. I'm just glad I finally realized my dream of joining the Navy.

<1> Well hopefully you get a few more good years out of it before it gets really bad.
<1> oh wow! thats great! it was really nice to chat with a teacher 
<0> Yeah me too, I think its cruel to catch fish on a hook, I would never do it
<0> I would never get nail art! They look awful and do everything but decorating your nails!
<0> It is very clever.  I wonder if it does fall in the definition of genius!
<1> awe that is so sweet ! how old ?
<0> It was a ford focus,  it was actually a car I had and was in the process of paying off,  and they just gave it to me!
<0> I don't remember that song but I would probably recognize it. They are very popular across the world!
<1> bluegrass and poverty is good for is then.
<0> I have three boys and two girls. 
<0> Yes but I really do not know how to draw
<1> I've never been to New York but want to go so bad. I have a friend that lives there, she says she'll let me stay with her if I visit.
<1> Oh, I am sorry. But I think more than education, you need to have some luck in your favor.
<0> Oh cool.  I wonder why this isn't played more in the states.
<0> Nice name! I wish I had a dog, but my parents won't let me get one.
<0> It is good work, but I actually hate doing it.

<0> oh you have red hair! i bet thats cute :D i just have natural dark brown hair haha

<0> Sydney 
<1> that's cool . have you met anyone famous ? my mom met elvis .
<0> they really are , just not worth it
<1> They have a great public transportation system where I live, I will have to look into riding the bus.
<1> You probably also learned your brother is a cheapskate,  haha. I hope you did end up getting that car one day!
<1> Lucky you. Are you always a positive person or it's just been an amazing week really?
<0> I don't have the attention span for movies. I don't watch them. I prefer TV.
<0> Yea. English of course,  then French,  Spanisha and Chinese.
<1> Nope. I've never been on one, but it seems scary.
<0> I don't know. I don't think I will get it.
<1> Me too, every Friday I eat steak with my family.
<0> No it's not safe at all. And neither is kayaking. That's why I hate that kind of sport and would never actually do it. 
<0> No I have not but will look for their song after this, when was the band formed?
<0> Maybe too nice. I might never see him again
<0> Crowded and hot. Just like the food. Austin has very nice people there as well.

<1> i like it too . nothing beats the woods .
<1> you have got your hands full over there .
<1> Not at all, I don't really have feelings towards them either way.
<1> I do not care if the spaceship crew is attacked or not, something that would attack them is okay.
<0> I hate drawing, it's just really boring in my opinion.
<0> Neither have I.
<1> I'm sorry, I can't relate. I just don't understand how you can get so upset and emotional over some old photos.
<1> Sounds gross. I don't like cake. I prefer something salty.
<1> But i'm not having passion in it
<0> I do miss him. I should arrange to catch up with him over coffee soon.
<0> It's in Pure Mathematics. I'm great with numbers and I've been studying a lot. 
<0> Me too. I don't eat them.
<0> I think the Red Sox are a better club than the Yankees.
<0> It's amazing and his voice just grabs you in. He was nominated for three Latin Grammy awards in 2011. I'm sure he'll also be nominated this year for his new album.
<1> how you must interract with people. All the cool rules and the way you can approach the bench. law clerks, stenographers, it rules.
<0> My aunt. It's weird she's the only one who has the red hair.
<0> THank you!  I love Vegas!  It is so much fun.
<1> Aww that's so sweet! Good for you!
<1> My parrot tries to talk to Alexa all the time, it never works.
<0> I don't sleep during the daytime, I have too much coffee in me to not be alert.
<0> I don't know why you're telling me this stuff, I could care less.
<0> I'm not sure buddy but we often desire it because we want to be left alone or so we can think for ourself
<1> Oh, but I didn't ask what you lie about.
<0> Yes i have a child in each marriages and i pay the Child maintenance directly for the care and support of children of a relationship that has been terminated
<1> I don't have any yet, I'm anxious to get my first one!
<1> aha, i dont really like baseball I prefer cricket
<0> We swam and just enjoyed each others' company.
<0> I think Harry Potter is childish 
<1> life is good to be enjoyed , work hard and play hard
<0> The clear daytime sky and the deep sea appear blue, imagine if they where a different color they would be so weird to look at.
<1> fictions are not that interesting
<1> That would be a great hobby, travel the world and collect pens. Might take some money though.
<0> Sure i i knew about harsh cold. That's why I'm putting on a big jacket right now.
<0> So a vegan is a meat eater, correct?
<1> Marching band.  Not as cool, I'm afraid.  I'm a lab tech in a cancer research institute. 
<0> That series has lots of twist ending.  I love the dark, satirical tone of the episodes.  So unique!
<1> Hell no, I never rest and I will never suggest anyone to rest. Life's too short to be passive!
<1> its better to not have any pets
<1> That's really sweet of you, I love animals too
<0> sewing has really brought that out for me . if you have meat , we can grill it .
<0> I personally love chicken, My wife makes the best fried chicken.  Are you married?
<1> Yes it is, In Middle Eastern dishes they dont use cinnamin and allspice to cook beef and lamb.
<1> Well, don't feel guilty over feeling this way. You can't help your emotions, but it would benefit you much to go to therapy.
<0> A courtship is the period of a relationship before engagement. So basically dating!
<0> I believe that it is! I think violet is at the end of the spectrum, like in a rainbow!
<1> Oh, yeah I will not be going to Rams games since it is too far too travel.
<0> I think I'd like to have a chihuahua. I don't have any dogs right now.
<1> It can be a trying time, though a lot of valuable lessons!
<1> I am a teacher in a public school and it quite a demanding job, i barely have time for myself, but i enjoy teaching my young students.
<1> Haha, I feel ya. In my city there's not a lot of basketball courts so the kids set up hoops on the sidewalks.
<1> i'm indebted to all the nurses who stitched me up in the emergency room .
<1> thats cool. i always wanted to go to mexico.
<1> you can really cause permanent damage. a good chair is important too if you don't want to hurt your back 
<0> My family were into cattle. I love the farm but hope school can lead me to more. Thus the need for an A.
<0> That's interesting they combined bands to sell almost 32 million record in the United States.
<1> Tony Bennett is my favorite. I can't stop listening to him!
<1> Yeah I don't like steven universe now.
<1> Don't be, they're actually kind of a let down once you see them.
<1> I have two kids, but no pets.
<1> No, I wanted to see some music but never got a chance
<1> That must have been very embarrassing.
<1> What else do you do in your spare time? I like to play board games and go fishing
<1> No dowry, no.  I had it backwards before.  We jump the broom because we can't afford a minister to perform the ceremony.  So it represents a SHAM marriage.
<0> then i hope you run as fast as i swim !
<0> i was not happy
<0> Yes, it really is. I am somewhat undecided myself. How do you feel?
<0> Yeah, they must have. Thankfully, throughout history, most couples have only had one child.
<1> I don't even know my expenses though. I will have to research
<0> what are their name , i love dogs
<1> I agree, nothing good can come from spending time alone, away from people. 
<1> It must be tough on you. You probably aren't having a good time.
<1> i believe the queen of england loves them also
<0> I wasn't guilty for the ticket.
<0> i've always wanted to try surfing .
<1> Well it's no big deal and I'm surprised you are excited.
<1> yes i do herb for my migraines raising 2 kids is nauseating
<0> My favorite band is Oasis. I listen to them all day long!
<0> By all means do! I've never even been to Europe, so I need help.
<0> Yeah, I just wish I started sooner. I wish swimming lessons were mandatory here like they are in other countries.
<0> a golden medal and my name in the gym wall 
<0> your cat sounds cool ! that name , though . . .
<0> Never did get back.  Figured I'd hang out here and start a coffee roasting business.  I'll be the only one,  so success seems likely.
<1> I think thats pathetic you don't contribute to more chores. 
<0> haha we definitely agree there!! Well what do you do to relax?
<0> Yes it was, the story revolves around  the creation of One Ring to rule the other Rings of Power as the ultimate weapon to conquer and rule all of Middle-earth
<0> so you like stranger things ?
<0> wow
<0> Sometimes. It depends on what mood I'm in being bipolar in all. Luckily the meds are helping with that.
<0> Yes, I'm a lawyer. 
<0> i coordinate anyone anywhere . i help the doers in the world make connections
<1> Yes, I feel that social cues are followed very closely in this current society.
<0> Ooh!! Interesting!
<1> I'm not a joker.  I'm a shape shifter and a pacifist.  I always turn the other cheek.
<1> Awesome!! Sounds better than me being stuck in an office!
<0> It has the worlds largest city airport system as measured by passengers per year.
<1> I can't say to that, but I do know that in 1995 the rugby union and league joined, and became a professional sport, but took 100 years for this to happen.
<0> imagine dragons? ive never heard of them, are they any good?
<0> Yeah I feel like because I got into camp at such an older age I can only handle cabin style really.
<1> You're strange people normally don't get nervous at their first day of work
<1> I try but even when I was young video games weren't my thing
<1> I did see an impersonator in Vegas one time before and it was okay.
<0> I felt terrible,  honestly. I chose work over spending time with my son. Something I always wanted to avoid.
<0> It all depends on what you add to the pasta. In southern italy, meat is commonly eaten with pasta.
<0> Yes I did,  It was such a shocker!
<0> I will start speaking gibberish and sweat bad. Not only that but my face turns so red!!!
<0> I live alone
<0> Well that sounds easy enough. Thanks - I'll try and bake some.
<1> What do you like to do?
<1> i have never played it
<0> hopefully , when i graduate in two years i'll be able to shop a lot too
<1> I love Bananas 
<0> yes... but I think your average person doesn't think about it on a day to day basis
<1> I'm sorry your life is a mess right now, it makes me sad you are having a hard time.
<1> No, just keep going until you've finished - it will be over sooner that way.
<0> OH that is unfortunate. I'm glad he could live on somewhat in the character of Lightning McQueen
<1> You did good, but I did not care either way.
<1> I know your wife’s name. 
<0> I just wish I had enough to testify in court against those theives.
<1> Not really interested in knowing how many holes it has.
<1> My father isn't a doctor, he's an accountant. 
<1> i'm sure you aren't alone in wanting a pet dragon .
<1> I work a sales job and I don't know anybody that loves country music.
<0> I don't really care. I don't think much of the Arsenal.
<0> Well I agree with those few cultures, women shouldn't have long hair.
<0> I'm a waitress too!
<0> I see. I have lifted 400 before.
<1> Blech, not me. I hate kale and wouldn't eat it even if they PAID me!
<0> I just wish I had more free time these days, as I work a lot at the restaurant.
<0> Cool!  I have leather wallpaper in my bathroom.
<1> I never liked playing NES.
<1> That is so true! I have many friends that are interested in philosophy. 
<0> Yes,  I am just a little upset right now.
<0> Well i heard that pizza was invented in naples, this is the modern story and since it has became in many areas of the world!
<1> You self-entitled brat! Just kidding,  your mother loves you
<1>  i have a few of them, those are the only pets i have, though i would like to have more.
<1> Yeah, it was hard. But over it now. Just trying to move along with life. lol
<0> Who was responsible for making  the first french cuisine?
<1> Kids can be funny that way.  What's your favourite horror movie of all time?
<0> Traveling to islands is a terrible idea. I prefer to stay inland as much as possible.
<1> Me too, I hate dogs.
<1> I do not think we actually have a culture, that's one reason I hate it here.
<0> Since Chick fila was founded in COllege Park, GA, it's probably taken some time to spread throughout the country
<1> I get kind of annoyed when dogs do too many tricks anyway.
<1> I'm sure you could find some amazing artifacts among their more than 70,000 pieces! 
<0> Yes, my mom and I am. I had such a bad time at the party, everyone was boring me and worst of all the theme of the party was green..... ugh, i hate green.
<1> I've always thought Japan was so boring.
<1> Oh I see. Are you far from home?
<1> I think that sounds exciting to deal with a tornado.
<0> That would be difficult to do, but I can see their reasons for it. So vegetarians actually will eat some eggs and dairy is that correct?
<0> True. I've been a huge fan of Switzerland basketball for a very long time.
<1> Yeah, i think the government hides too much
<0> Impressive. We went to Hawaii last year, that was a blast.
<0> Yes, it gets so hot here in New Mexico compared to where we moved from in Nevada. We can only let the dogs out for a short time.
<0> Yes that would be nice. Yes I have been there, great experience.
<1> Your girlfriend is rubbish at surprises
<1> Better rub a rabbits foot for luck since you haven't had any lately.
<1> I took your bike because I need it more than you do.
<0> Yes. They all have stories. Some are homeless by choice or mental illness and some work but can't afford an apartment 
<1> I bet that will be awful for you.
<1> Go for it , but I would stay away from the iphone, I heard they are real junk.
<1> You can act as an actor in the coming future
<0> Yeah, I have two bulldogs and they love them.
<1> Do you like to drink? I love vodka!
<0> I wish I had a sibling, I'm an only child
<0> now I just watch everything through streaming on netflix, haven't had a DVD for many years
<1> Honestly, it's not that big of a deal. Just do your job and don't worry about anybody else.
<0> I like Apple, though. It's a good company.
<1> Yeah i bet it was a long long drive
<1> You should relax a little though because hard work won't pay off.
<0> Me neither, I heard it once.
<0> oh where you moving to ?
<0> I don't know anything about SpongeBob. I have never heard of it before.
<0> Pizza is one of the most popular foods in the world in Europe and in North America
<0> I always wanted to be a judge. It is going to take a long time.
<1> Those drugs must have really helped your son, then! I'm glad :)
<1> Yeah but you also have your family for that too - you can always just get another pet. 
<1> i am still in college at michigan state it pays the bills for now .
<1> I've never lived in a haunted house, it must be so scary

<0> Yes it seems so. I'd like to try a new beer for a change.
<0> haha , i would say that counts ! i love making food for others .
<1> Oh, I don't eat that many eggs with my meals. Maybe 2 max. 
<1> I do not like pets and i have none.
<0> get out ! me too ! my wife had blonde hair . i'm a baby doctor . you dance ?
<1> The pay is decent. I work for myself so I can make anywhere from $25 - $250 per hour.
<0> Bruce, just the other day I had to stop him from chasing the mailman. I should really consider training my dog. 
<0> both taco and cheddar cheese originate from Italy so the have some common filling 
<0> Been working since 6am this morning.
<0> We are going to stay in Portland and explore it for a couple days,  and we're probably going to do a lot of hiking so we can see all the beautiful scenery while we're there.
<0> You are right and I am really looking back fondly on some times in the past
<1> I knew that
<1> Its tough at times, but you know, they grow up.
<1> What other businesses was walt disney doing before the movies production?
<0> The Story So Far seems like a pretty lame name for a band though.
<0> I love the black nature of it
<0> I don't, actually. I've never heard of any punk rock music. 
<0> that's the best way to learn through experience.
<1> No. I don't have any animals, just work with them.
<0> We haven't actually seen any snow all season.
<0> It is usually a form of flavor condensed into a powder they can mix. 
<0> I felt horrible for the squirrel. I dont like dead animals
<0> I think I'm pretty funny, but my friends think I should sing.
<0> Ha, I'm not sure what that means. Hope your gas gets better though.
<1> Yeah, it does. I'll make sure to gift my dad something back this Christmas to repay the favor.

<1> Me too economics is the worst!
<0> Becaus I like to see the overall picture of things and avoid people that ask to many questions.

<1> I am sure.  Which state are you located?  One with many storms and insurance work?

<1> That is awesome! i love to volunteer and have always found engineering to be fascinating.
<0> I didnt realize a truck would be through at me. Destroyed about a 4rd of the building 
<0> I don't do well with the heat.

<0> it isn't my daily driver but i do have a purple car yours is blue ! ?
<1> I don't really care for dogs, I am more of a cat person
<0> I like salsa better than dance drama.   Dance drama is something that I did years ago.
<1> Yes. They are very goog companions of humans and can also be used for herding
<1> Health care is so important, but I'd keep my kids away from psychologists at all costs. 
<0> i don't have any pets 
<1> There is no point.  People never change.
<0> Is there enough blue in the world?
<0> ah i  get it now.. well you have convinced me! i hate it as well.
<1> that is what awesome so you are single?
<0> Then you run like hell when that happens XD 
<0> It's a job with a homeless charity
<1> You deserve to be happy about that,  that is not an easy class!
<1> My daughter is only 1 and I'm already worried about when she starts dating!

<1> I enjoy working during the weekend.
<1> Your whole family has no musical talent.

<1> I always win at everything I try to compete.
<0> that would be pretty rough
<1> What kind of kid would love old cars, he sounds dumb to me.
<0> You should do it, getting out there isn't scary at all. Total cake walk. 
<0> I will have to stay home because we have two kids,  but our neighbor actually offered to make the drive with him!

<1> I don't think you should buy a car, it's not useful
<0> They have a number of great museums, but I would recommend walking the Embarcadero, or taking in a Padres game.

<0> Reminds me of the people I grew up with here in Alabama. I've lived here my whole life.
<0> It's basically when eclampsia progresses to the point that your blood doesn't clot and your organs start shutting down.  I had to stay 7 days past her birth to get my blood to start clotting again.  My sister came down and stayed for 2 weeks to help us out.

<0> The military look. Is it green too to go along with the military theme? I hate the color green.
<1> Doctors can interpret your beautiful dreams for you.

<1> Did I tell you my dream job is to be a Hollywood movie star?

<0> Then the next step is Google Chrome which is used to serve as the platform for the app.
<0> I know. I think i died a little inside when I saw her clothes.

<0> That's awesome! My fiance lives in Spain so I have to travel there a lot to go visit him.
<1> I'm not totally sure on the name of the cross-breed; but I know that each is bred for distinctive purposes.  Alpacas are bred for their "wool."

<0> I love it. I've moved further and further south with each move. Eventually I'll move to Key West.
<0> Ohhh great where you get the cat?
<1> I'm sorry, I've never heard of that before. What is sachertorte?
<0> Hm thats definitely true. It seems like a very emotionally taxing job, but I just love the animals so much I think it would be worth it.
<0> i used to train football players ! now i just ride my bike for excercise
<0> I know. All i need is a boyfriend now
<1> Time managament is not that important to learn. What's important is listening skills.

<0> that's great . what branch ?
<0> Yeah we're inseparable. You must be close to yours too.

<0> Being on the seems like easy work then.
<0> Yeah, they may not have a choice, since it's always outdoors. It's not like other games that have standardized playing areas. It has to cope with all the different terrains available, and playing against those is a part of the game! 
<0> I'm married but no children yet me and my wife are always so busy working to have time to raise children.
<0> Allocate the time for reading good books and caring the pets.
<1> That's good but you have to share the tips
<1> Yes they do. They don't play enough, which is part of the reason that I don't enjoy teaching! 
<1> i like mom and pop type places rather than large ones . you ?
<0> i enjoy going to park and bird watching . love country music
<1> i don't like talking on the phone , never did . i prefer to text .
<0> There's various dishes actually. It's a Chinese dish of small steamed or fried savory dumplings containing various fillings,  served as a snack or main course.
<1> I have a bad feeling you failed.
<0> I love carrots so that is what I am planting right now.  
<0> Absolutely! It makes the game even more enjoyable.
<0> Ok,i love attending interviews and i never felt nervous on any interviews
<0> that's a good thing . do not stop .
<0> I've wrote a paper on piercings in and they have a lot of history. 
<0> Nope,  not at all unfortunately.
<0> Yes.  And the tricky part is that you can choose to stay in the miserable job for financial/life stability,  and then be crabby and unhappy around your kids,  or you can take the risk and maybe be in a worse financial place but be happier at home.  It's tough.  
<0> Yep, the only extraterrestrial sky that has ever been personally observed is the moon's. Other's have been from pictures only.
<0> So
<1> Nope. Never had one. They seem like they'd be a ton of work and I'm busy enough, you know?
<0> I am very happy. I have been jobless for six month. I was almost becoming crazy.
<1> that's what i need to do . then i'd be on vacation all the time !
<0>  In its original run, Hanna and Barbera produced 115 "Tom and Jerry" shorts for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and I think I've seen them all.
<0> Woah I didn't even know that! Where did you learn that fact?
<0> I hear you. Cold is no fun unless you like to ski or something.
<1> Have you ever been to Shenandoah National Park? There are many waterfalls and always lots of tourists.
<0> So true. I was lucky enough that I had some money saved for an emergency, so I can use it on my surgery tomorrow.
<0> that would be cool. we have a great group of guys this year. We are traveling to Las Vegas in a few weeks for a tourney.
<1> Yes I think that's why we should all have children so the souls from previous lives have a place to live!
<0> I am interviewing for CEO. It's going to be a breeze.
<0> My cats would not welcome a new animal! lol Popular pets are often noted because they are attractive and have loyal or playful personalities. I love the playful aspect of kittens.
<1> That's understandable, I would be too. It would be a good idea to tell them how you feel so they don't do it again.
<1> My parents are both scientists so they always take me to museums.
<1> not me. I like trying all foods
<0> Yeah,  too many scary things can go wrong!
<1> Is it good for cardio and weight lifting?
<0> Sure! I would enjoy that. My wife can tell you about her gymnast days, too. She competed in the olympics.
<1> but it was a good thing
<0> That's cool, hows the weather haha
<0> Actually that would make you a widower.
<0> Just down the river,  in town
<0> Well, I'd take a well made pasta dish in place of money if I were in...that line of work. So it fits well enough
<1> Yah. I love them though. I work at a zoo.
<1> i agree . yep i cook everything . do you cook ?
<0> wow you are a dead head how cool is that !
<1> my sister would hate you
<1> I'd say having an excuse to not do things sounds great.
<1> That sounds so fun! Last time I hiked was when I was visiting Seattle.
<0> Thank you. I gave me great satisfaction to care for him though I felt a bit sad when I had to let him go home. 
<1> seventeen years and i can not wait to go on my honeymoon
<0> yeah indeed,  why there is nobody to look after them?
<1> I wouldn't know I don't know any food critics
<0> sylvester my cat  :(
<1> I have never tried shopping online, so that would give an option. 
<0> my creepy landlord is jacking up my rent to i have to economize .
<1> I wouldn't know. I am vegetarian since I was 15 years old.
<1> No, I can't stand the sound of my voice. 
<0> It was but I found everything I needed before going. Too bad it always takes so long at those offices.
<1> I don't know I have never been on one but would love to some day.
<0> i like games as long as i'm not a purple character. i hate purple.
<0> I nervous for her because its the start of her freshman year and she has all Honors classes.

<0> I really like dogs.
<0> I have a dog, he's a pitbull and he is 4
<0> You'll be surprised. Just do your best and leave the rest to the Lord! 
<0> No,  it took a lot of work and special photographs
<1> Yes. It can be.
<0> Fishing is just so boring to me. You just sit outside all day. 
<1> I like most animals really, except for dogs.
<0> music is nice i try to wear head phones but my face cheeks are just to big .
<1> But I love tight spaces, it makes me happy and proud.
<1> I hope they've screwed everything.
<1> I have College classes however so I might not have time. 
<0> I'm not sure. He might be trying to invite someone else as well. He does that from time to time
<0> I had a boyfriend when I was in highschool and it was nothing like that. I'm so sorry!
<0> Yes, she won two silver medals in the 100m dash, pretty impressive right?
<1> Then you should give up pageants, you should be ashamed of yourself
<0> Im positive its a ghost,  Just walking around.
<1> are you going alone?
<0> Nice! I'm in the financial sector myself, in the banking industry to be more specific.
<1> That does sound scary! Do you ever wake up in different places throughout the night?
<1> i've had to look in the in the mirror and okay Lord what do i need to work on, point it out to me 
<1> oh i love those too ! they are so good ! do you like to cook ?
<0> hah ! , the guru of fitness i've the t shirt !
<0> Just use what's available to you. That's what people did in prehistoric times: they identified useful trees and vines and protected them, while getting rid of the ones they didn't want.
<1> You should try again.  You usually find someone when you are actively looking.
<0> It does! It also is the location of the New England Culinary Institute so there are certainly a lot of great cooks there.
<1> True.  Curry is used very heavily in these dishes. Sometimes the spicy ingredients have a real kick to them.
<1> Dogs are just animals.  They don't really know what they are doing.
<0> Nothing really, I like to watch sports in my spare time.
<0> I wish I could be a teller, I work in fast food.
<0> Yeah. I can see how it changed. I will admit to loving the movie "Independence Day," though.
<0> Led Zeppelin, the english rock band was formed in London in 1968!
<0> I would love to do it sometime, but I don't know if I can take so many looks in a place like that haha
<0> Yeah! Where do people get their food from?
<0> Ok.. it's strange that I just hadn't heard of it. 
<0> It's a really good deal, even if it is on a Monday. You wouldn't believe the cost to do it on the weekend.
<1> Oh no sorry. I don't know anything about tap dancing.
<0> Ha, me too! Not real sure about the hard-boiled eggs though! LOL
<0> i actually love to fly in airplanes
<0> yeah sure very warm and durable
<1> Never give up,  you never lose if you never give up. you got this 
<1> Nice I like to do those things too! I wonder if we walk in the same parks as we both live in Chicago.
<0> What are you majoring in?
<0> I hate the beach.
<1> I know how it feels, I'm sorry. When my old house burned down I was at work and got a call from my neighbour.
<1> at least you can still be up and moving around , that is a good trait
<1> I watch football, how about you?
<0> We grilled a couple of hotdogs and hamburgers,  and we're roommates basically. It works good because I'm so used to living with her that it's a lot better than an average roommate.
<1> I'm sure they are! Itll feel more normal soon,  I am sure
<1> well it's just ink on the page. nothing as scary as the real punks who try to cause trouble a the club I bounce in the evenings
<0> that is very ture!  sounds like you had amazing grandparemnts
<1> I DON'T TRUST LAWYERS THEY ARE NOT USUALLY LOYAL.
<1> What's the topic of your books?

<0> Have you ever used the Youtube Red? The paid subscription where you can listen to music on YouTube?
<1> i know what you mean . do you take exercise for it ? it helps !
<0> Yeah their smell is as bad as the way they look. They're the weirdest looking creatures I've ever seen.

<0> I just wish it was about another planet. I really don't like Mars.
<0> I used to eat meat but for health and environmental reasons (and personal preference!) I decided to stop.

<0> Yeah I know that now for sure
<0> I really didn't like Madonna's music when I was a young.
<1> Good me and my husband are scared to fly and never gone on plane.
<1> Well have fun on your trip tomorrow!
<0> I pooped in my own pants,  in front of my friends!
<0> I'm glad I had the time with her that I did.
<0> why would you cheat on him? I will never understand that
<0> Thank you. I really miss her and hope I can take care of her better now.
<0> Thanks! I am sure I am going to crush it.
<0> Not really, having a family is a drag.
<0> Yeah I hear you, that's why I had to take this journey. I had many mornings at home that I had trouble getting started.
<0> What only the sixth I thought it would be higher up than that!
<1> I do real estate. I was able to obtain my license in 2 weeks and now its my main income.  
<1> I haven't but that might be a good idea for me to try out!
<1> But Canada is filled with dangers and it won't be fun there. 
<1> it's too bad that we are different.
<1> I like to read things online, watch TV, play games and eat way too much fast food. 
<1> Dogs are so cute!  What's your dog's name?
<0> Dogs are sometimes very dangerous that is why i don't keep one because i have alot of kids around me, i keep cats and birds alone
<0> That's right ! Cant believe I'm getting that old 
<0> Have you had any interviews recently?

<1> Why not?
<1> That's great! I bet he had a lot of fun too!
<1> Oh i hate music and playing instruments,rather i go for shopping instead.
<1> That seems like it would be a lot of work.
<0> Which games do you play?
<0> i like to paint picture of nature .
<1> That'd be nice, but I don't think money is that important.
<0> No, I like Sci-Fi Film, Star Wars series.
<1> Well you should focus on your career first though. It's not good to put your family above everything.
<0> Yes. It is true and now they are a large single-toed creature. They used to be smaller.
<0> I am at work , my family and I own a bakery.
<0> ah . im single.

<0> I hope your right.
<1> I don't play any instruments, do you play anything other than the piano?
<1> I often try to go once a month when work isn't too busy, and I'll spend a weekend there. It's very therapeutic. Do you relax much?

<0> That's okay, I never liked bambi much anyway.
<1> No I do not. I hate dogs, especially pitbulls. They're so mean.
<0> Yeah, I went fishing once, but did not like it at all. How was your karate class?
<0> That's cool. I do think they're pretty ugly little things though!
<1> you are right, but i hate reading those fiction book, its not interesting though.
<0> I am unemployed at the moment sadly.
<1> You should worry.  If you're as prepared as you say, you could still choke when the test is in front of you.
<0> i don' really enjoy skateboarding
<0> I live in Philly where the Eagles play!
<1> You have to keep them close.
<0> Me neither. I don't know much about them.

<0> That is a good one. Good boys. And girls. 
<1> How many people are in your family?
<1> I work in import export business.
<0> Yes, I agree with you. I find it very easy to understand people's emotions and how they are feeling inside. 
<1> Understandably so. But hey,  we all make mistakes and failing one class isn't the end of the world. In fact I failed Calculus 3 this semester. So take pride in what you have accomplished and just work hard next semester!

<0> Exactly! It has its roots in the blues, rock, as well as acid rock.
<0> I want to give a Dobermann puppy to a family with no children.
<0> He didn't go to prison, they just gave him a fine.
<0> My dad is a doctor so you should try that.

<0> that is too bad . i've been all over europe and asia , myself .
<0> I feed my daughter healthy food so she has energy to swim. She hates soccer though.

<1> I agree, old people are boring and are not fun to hang out with.
<0> Adam levin was a great artist, you should check him out.
<0> I did not know that. However collies are very active and agile.
<1> I'd tell him your secret
<1> The important to reach a goal it to have a plan and commit to it. 
<0> My favourite rock bands are The Beatles, AC/DC. Sad part is that  rock is  sometimes associated with aggression and machismo.

<0> I guess we're lucky to have this opportunity. 
<1> you must be a bit lonely ? my wife is blind .

<1> Well it's fine if they took one thing. 
<1> I've heard of oral fixations before,  but only in the context of like chewing fingernails and smoking cigarettes,  etc. But I guess if I think about it,  a lot of people chew fingernails,  and I'm sure that's just as bad bacteria-wise. Maybe the booger eaters are on to something.

<0> It was only 20 years ago.  Those were the days.

<1> I don't know I haven't read either of them.

<0> What pizza chain would that be?
<1> its okay.... who cares for embarrassment when you get your favorite deal
<0> Cool, do you know if any famous works are at the Met in NYC?
<1> Well, it is not that big of a deal really, nothing to be proud of.
<0> yes I know my husband has to have paralegals to assist with research
<1> It would drive me crazy also,  she should be more considerate. 
<1> Yeah I have been to about 4 riots myself. 
<1> Sorry,I won't believe in god.

<0> same and i like to dye my hair .
<1> I use a Samsung phone. It is the only phone I have
<0> Can you speak to anyone about that?
<0> But i thought you like reading too?
<0> I don't think there is any clinically proven medication that works.  Surgery and implants are the only proven things to help
<0> I really hope they do not pass any more laws about this.
<1> I love people that complain.
<0> Still waiting..... That's the most upsetting. Because they waste no time taking your money

<0> I like to eat chips and cookies.
<0> Do you know where it originated? It seems like an odd food to me
<0> I know. I can't imagine what life would be like without my brother.
<0> I nthink it's great too, don't you? Too many people sitting on couches, we are made to be active
<1> that's a fair point! it seems like this could really benefit the economy and fund more government necessities
<1> I think pizza is disgusting and so overrated
<1> I know of Nile and their roots in North Carolina. They are pretty cool! I like Carcass and Morbid Angel as my best bands.
<1> I'm sure he will be fine, he has a great shot
<1> Yeah, I've never been cheated on before.
<0> Wow, that's an amazing goal and I hope you'll reach it.
<1> I think you are overreacting a little bit. I spend most of my nights alone and I thing it is quite fun.
<0> Well good for you but I hate beaches. Sand goes everywhere!
<1> i agree too
<0> I do not like natural things
<0> No NO,  I just saying how ready I am to go,  I havbent left yet though

<1> I hate going to the beach. I wish I could do something more fun.
<0> Definitely! I never go barefoot.

<1> Me too! Being an Atheist and not liking anything related to Religion is a very lonely life.
<0> i do too in my spare time , i also play music when i'm free
<0> Perhaps they're a bit over the top and extreme, but it's nice to know that someone else shares my sentiments.
<0> For sure! Everything ready to go,  and I can relax and count down the days. 
<0> Any standout restaurants? 
<1> That is even worse,  Like why would someone just do that when commited to someone.
<0> I don't care much for French fries but most people do enjoy them a good bit.
<1> ah ok what kind of tv shows do you like
<1> that's so cute , do you two cuddle together when she is in layers ?
<0> YES, BUT I'VE KNOWN CULTURES MORE INTERESTING THAN ARGENTINE. 
<0> burritos are perfect for camping or whatever you do outdoors .
<0> That makes me happy that maybe they can't build on a lot of it so if I buy a house, maybe the land around it will be preserved.  Does it have a big tourist scene?
<1> i love working on my car actually . only on weekends though . you ?
<0> Thankfully, no one heard what I said!
<0> she is just a terrible liar,  she knows that and so she doesn't even try lol
<1> i like too but blackberry and strawberry is my world of taste

<0> I couldn't. I hate animals. I've never even owned a pet.
<1> Well I hope it's more exciting than it sounds.
<0> Scrambled eggs are my favorite.  Especially because I ate them so much in college.
<1> You probably won't pass anyway!

<0> I love it!  I couldn't help but think about all of the fun times I had with my friends in junior high watching it repeatedly

<0> I actually thought they would have been higher on that list.  What is their best selling car?
<0> no I do not have pet, oh my you actually bake cakes for pets really?
<1> I know what you mean because I haven't checked my blood sugar in months.
<0> Jeeps and Land Rovers should never be called an SUV, they don't even look alike.
<0> I did around 40 in my "Purple Potato, Rustled Jimmies" series, want to put them all on a poster so people can stare and WTF?
<0> You, too! 
<1> That would be great. I just started a new 9 to 5 job so I'll have to let you know when I'm free.

<0> Have you tried it? How did you like it?
<1> Wow, guess I'll have to check it out sometime.
<0> No, I'm not looking forward to fall, that's when all the evil boogeymen come out
<0> Not really,  they are young,  but they were trying to get a sibling in trouble instead of themselves.  I wasn't expecting it at such a young age...only 3.
<1> Didn't trappers use to make hats from skunk hides?

<1> i would like to see it for sure but i am going to have to take some time off from work.
<0> Just think positive. It worked for me, I was just chosen for a promotion over my coworker Sally

<0> That must have been nice to live there, shame he isn't a better singer though.
<1> Me too. What kind of concerts do you attend?

<1> Mine is too!
<1> Yeah people like that are jerks
<0> the poduction process  first step in red wine production, after picking, involves physical processing of the grapes

<0> Ok but the show Dora the explorer is an exeption.
<0> Are you an environmentalist?
<1> same here, I would rather just play with my dog. 
<1> It's always nice to get out on the trails and share those moments. It's even better when you have someone tagging along.
<0> Yeah french fires are a disaster lol Too much oil of course. Little oil is ok though.
<1> That's cool that you are a vegetarian, I'm a vegan because I love animals and I'm an animal doctor
<0> I volunteer at a resale shop.

<0> I think spending on stuff like space and outer space exploration are a waste of money. 
<0> I kinda don't care much about comedians and comedy in general
<1> to be honest it is none of your business to interfere in someone's life when things happen suddenly. you should give your friends some privacy.
<0> I painted my walls blue.
<0> Luckily I know none in real life. Or so I think.
<0> Well you know guys have there way with words!

<1> Nor should you.  You should not try to understand them.
<0> Probably but I hate baseball just like most people here in South Dakota.

<1> Are you looking for a job?
<0> i often fantasize about magic being real .
<1> i just hate it . maybe because i am from there .
<1> Georgia is definitely on my list of states to visit! Right now I'm living in Buffalo, New York.
<0> I don't believe in ghosts, though. I've never seen any kind of weird stuff happening.
<0> I hope not. I don't think anyone did or my coworkers would've told me.. but who knows if someone was just laughing behind my back?!
<1> I haven't done either of those things ever either
<0> i agree 100 .
<0> I always blame myself
<1> My family is so supportive - I am very lucky!
<1> I want you to know that buying the jailers laptop was quite expensive.

<1> my dream is to become a programmer
<1> Yes, but fortunately insurance should take care of it, right?
<1> Yes but he doesn't seem like a good friend
<0> That's okay, today is my day off from work.
<0> Not really,  I just felt really grateful to be alive and well. 
<1> I didn't get any packages today, they all came yesterday. I opened all the packages last night. I got new cooking pans and a fancy chef's knife.
<0> i've never been there ! have you always live there ?
<1> I guess it's a good thing her car got away with barely a scratch.
<1> I don't really care about being a good parent anyway.

<1> I don't understand why you would want to visit your childhood. You should not bother.
<1> she does like pizza . i could set you up
<1> Well don't let things go to your head too much.
<0> Typically she doesn't like female dogs but she seems to sense she was abused and needs love right now.
<1> I'm sure they're angry about that! They probably wish they fixed the house themselves!
<1> Who do you like?  I like James Patterson.  For the kids I highly recommend Newbery Award books.  They are good.
<1> I should look into H&R since a private accountant, even though he's a friend, is kind of expensive.  I even had to redo some paperwork this year because a form was left off!
<0> Im really good at wedding and fashion photography
<1> I love playing the piano in my free time. I have an exciting job which also gives me a lot of free time to pursue my hobby.
<0> I think since transportation existed. I do know someone who's family member used to give people rides on there back from place to place. Don't think he would have given me a free ride though. lol.

<0> No, I don't own any cats so I wouldn't know.

<1> for sure, but go with someboddy prepared and with a safe equipment, it's a dangerous sport
<0> How old were you when you lost them?
<1> Yeah, the smell of beets is almost as bad as the smell of steak. I could never stomach a steak.

<0> I got bullied really badly,  but some of my bullies apologized after
<0> Thats good. You know quite a lot !
<1> I thought you said you tipped it over on accident! Maybe she won't get upset since it was an accident.
<0> True, but I rather collect stamps given the time. Music is not so much my thing.
<0> Gardening  and growing plants can be labor intensive but I enjoy it 
<0> Really? I have always gotten good grades. I rarely study and still ace my tests.

<1> Sounds fun! I learned how to cook from my wife. What do you like to bake?
<0> long day at work , enjoying some beers ! how about you ?
<0> I'm not sure what her most recent one is called, but in 2010 she wrote the album, "Speak Now" all by herself!
<1> i wish i could go to Italy just once
<0> I would rather not, diving is too dangerous and I am scared of it. 
<0> I am sure it would be quite a sight but I don't like Zebras that much. Their stripes look weird.
<1> Really? I didn't know it was about a serial killer.
<1> I have one of the tropical ones.
<0> awesome ! do they have dogs in italy ?
<1> I hate apple martinis.
<0> Yeah, but I already have a PlayStation 4, so I don't think it's worth it to buy a PlayStation 5.
<0> I can only imagine how beautiful it is. Mount Ranier was gorgeous as well. I have been there.
<1> No. It's very hot out there. You will burn up if you do that.
<0> Yeah, she really loved the gift though, it was exactly what she wanted.
<0> Yes, I use to diet much more but realized it was just very unhealthy and I needed more food!
<1> Yeah, Dorian was pretty intense. I live close enough that we were getting nervous, but luckily it missed us. Makes you wonder what could happen in the coming years.
<0> That's good that it helps with the nail biting! I'd never thought of that. I'd probably have a hard time with the constant upkeep. 
<0> not really ! it happens less than baywatch !
<0> bombs ? so is there some particular reason for that ?
<1> That is a long time. Why not get married?
<0> no it is just me , i hope to meet someone special someday .
<1> That's great! I wish more people would garden, so much healthier to grow your own food.  I just had a small vegetable garden this year.
<0> I have a dog who could almost be considered domesticated lol, she is a handful though
<1> Just me and my cats. I'm unmarried, so I get to spend a lot of time with them,  How about you?
<0> Oh great, that's a wonderful job. How long have you been doing this?
<1> I love my face cheeks because they are big.
<1> i bet that was fun. being on your own sucks.
<1> I really wanted to be a chef
<1> oh no I think it is so much harder now, it was easier when slavery was around.
<0> yes so do i 
<0> what kind are you thinking ?
<1> Time is definitely easy to mange in regards to social interaction. 
<1> Yeah me too, my favourite band is probably The Beatles.
<0> But couldn't they just eat healthier in general and continue to consume animal product?
<0> Yeah it wasnt too bad just a couple scrapes,  its hard seeing your kids get hurt. 
<1> Perhaps we can find another time for me to view those exotic prints. 
<0>  I don't know it's getting old lately

<1> Oh thats really cool.  Definately one i'll have to check out.  Any other recommendations?
<1> I don't like pens. They are pretty boring. 
<0> I feel like Madeleine Stowe got this role and now we never hear of her anymore!  She was born 8/18/1958 so she still should be around.
<0> I just wish my little contributions mattered.
<0> Neat, but its not really for me it tenses me up

<0> there isn't any cause of alarm, socialites should accept them the way they are
<0> Yeah, I agree. Although, I thought her early music was much better when she wet by Ke$sha
<0> I do sing pretty well tho
<1> i think it had more to do with the fact that she was stealing from work .
<1> Ah, same as me then
<1> that is okay . reading is nice too . what do you do for a living ?
<1> Oh really! Yeah I know that reenactments are super popular. 
<0> That is true,  but I just miss being a kid as well I guess
<0> TV shows only create a fake and virtual world in the childrens mind.

<0> I don't like movies and would never ask someone if they have ever been in one.
<1> That's very nice. How do you want to help your parents? 
<1> Look up Alcoholics Anonymous on the White Pages on the web.  You can find a place near you.

<0> It was for math student of the year.
<1> Ohhhh try the ailment and tablet for quick recovery
<1> my friend is trusworthy
<1> No, I hate dogs, they scare me.

<0> i am 6 3 . a bit taller than you , i suppose !
<0> Willpower and a strong desire to get healthy.
<1> Yeah I'm really into computers and so I thought it would be cool to use technology when I asked. Do you like computers?
<0> I can't yell at her for it,  she is getting up in age and is trying her best. I gently reminded her that chicken needs to be cooked to 165 degrees and if she doesn't have a meat tempature checker,  I'd get one for her
<1> Kids take ages to grow.
<0> alot of people in the state of Florida like to go to Disney World and people often love to visit Orange County.
<1> yea, haha the Elvis Presley that I prefer.
<0> It was alright I guess. I had to take my car for a small repair. It's a 2011 VW Passat.
<1> professors and teachers are so ruthless
<0> Me neither, that would be wild! Sometimes if the waves are rough, instead of stand up surfing, I ride a bodyboard, usually lying on my belly! That's a lot of fun too!
<0> yeah and i stepped in their dogs poo this morning
<0> wow this is taking longer than reading all night
<1> I hope you can manage it since I've never really faced any medical issues, I can't really help you out much on this.
<1> They wo't give you money back because it not in their terms.
<0> i loved my parents but they passed away
<0> To be honest I don't trust foreign cows, only the ones grown here in America - they also tast best

<0> same, i don't have any family to go to musicals and concerts with
<1> Do you enjoy it?  I've considered starting a bakery.
<0> oh yes, those are awesome players! They started so young! I wish I had played tennis instead of football in high school
<0> wow that would be awesome. how much do you think she would charge?
<1> Mild stressors prepare your body to handle larger stress! Like getting a vaccine - it creates an immune response.
<1> I hope it rains 
<0> I thought about getting rid of her!
<0> Its enjoyable and relaxing, although i've only progressed to making ashtrays so far
<0> Not really.  My mom can't wait to retire.  She hates kids.
<1> i didn't ! i'd love to learn how to make bagels
<0> I don't waste my time with reading.
<0> I am not that brilliant. I couldn't make it pass high school.
<1> Not Really now, because I am at home, and my friends are all at school, and no one from my home hits me up that much.
<0> Losing money is part of the fun.
<1> Rick and Morty is such a boring show, I can't stand watching it.
<0> I prefer a dark.  The real key to the bean is in the roasting.  
<0> Whew. I feel better now. You are an expert on Mars. What else do you think I might want to know?
<1> I hate roses.
<0> True. I just hope they change the gameplay for the next one - I'm getting bored with the first-person aspect already.
<0> What are you talking about ? I Dont know anything about cats , i hate them.
<0> I don't follow her closely enough to see how her style has changed over the years but I agree.  A mall brand for a first lady?
<0> I doubt she will, I've never even met her before.
<0> Do you try to draw real life or fantasy? 
<1> hard working for prepare nice

<0> No, but I have been to Great Lakes Medieval Faire and Marketplace with my friends this summer.
<0> I expect an A.
<0> You are right. I wouldn't want the rings to fall off the pillow - my dog would eat them.
<1> Haha, he will have a new coach! Someone is lucky!
<0> Really. I will start my research about it. What do you do for a living?
<0> Of course not,  i went straight to sleep!
<0> I am so excited. I got exactly what I wanted, 
<1> i like legs alot alot alot
<0> reading in french mostly yeah
<1> Yea i suppose so, although it would be cool to be reincarnated at some point
<0> Yeah thats because heavy metal fans didn't become known as metalheads...
<1> I'm sure it will help long term as you say, was it arthritis?  
<0> yes man that is very big and chilly one. 
<0> fine , what is your qualification ?
<0> Thank you. I didn't spend a lot of time studying because I had to work a lot of extra hours. I hate school.

<0> gross i'm a vegan
<1> Oh really? That's interesting. I've actually never even been to a coffee shop before!
<1> I always wanted to open my own business. If things don't get better that is an option.
<1> I don't care how the days of the week were named.  It's boring.
<0> I was still a little scared,  but after take off,  I loosened up a little. I watched my favorite series downloaded on my phone and that seemed to distract me well.
<0> I love pasta. It is my favourite. I am not a big fan of pizza.
<1> I'm so scared one is going to hit me. I live really close to where they are.
<0> No,  not really,  but what's bugging me most is the place that has to schedule them cannot get me in until September!  I want to get this all done and over with and this is just drawing it out - makes me very nervous.
<0> Is that more efficient than the use of self powered diesel engines?
<1> That doesn't sound appealing, I hardly ever cook vegetarian. 
<1> you just haven't hiked with the right person! I can take you on some amazing trails.

<0> I'm glad it's over but I really should have asked them what blood type I am; they never told me.
<0> He must have been quite the inventive fellow. His ginger ale was dark colored and had a strong ginger spice flavor, probably quite different from the kind we're used to.
<0> The ones in my neighborhood are fairly large.  Is that a common trait of the labrador retriever?
<0> i don't have daughter

<0> Its faster in skilled hands. I would just hurt myself lol.
<1> I'm not adopted.i'm alone.
<0> Yeah,  once I fall out of my routine,  it's so easy to just keep staying out of it. So I guess whatever I can do,  even if it's not as good as the day before,  to just stay in the routine and to stay at it,  helps.
<0> I don't like watching any sports at all!
<0> I asked my sister to take me to a beach in Florida for my birthday, just me and her, It know it would be alot of fun

<0> Im not sure really it was so crowded all you could see was the cars next to you
<0> That's cool,  I will have to try playing an RPG sometime
<0> Ageing pretty much just means single cells of a human or animal have stopped dividing.
<1> Thats great! How old are you?

<0> She lies and steals money.
<0> No, never. They always back me up. 
<1> Yes it is very interesting guess i got it from my parents especially my mom she is into telecommunications
<0> I wonder what kind of chemicals they used back then? It must have been experimentation with different plants.
<0> He had a brain issue that got him instantly
<1> No, I hate going to the hospital. It makes me feel sick even if i am fine!
<1> I am weird, but I love getting lost.  I often learn more about an area that way.
<0> I got a bag to clean up the body and i buried him, 
<0> wow! That's interesting
<0> i would like to buy BMW
<1> Sometimes doing something you used to enjoy together helps. For me it is Disney movies.
<1> They don't eat crickets. Why would you think that?
<0> Well I am doing ok!
<0> No problem, but make sure to not visit the beachs, they are really dirty.
<0> yes just minor damage
<0> Why?  He's always been such a prick.  I wish I worked with someone else.  I'll be glad when he's gone.
<0> i love me some country music

<1> Yes.  That's why I love to sea bathe in order to get the sunscreen off.
<0> Hi! How are you. Are you a seafood or steak person?
<0> True I never cook for myself. I have a personal chef who cooks all my food. 
<1> no , i am too worried i'll get hurt . i assume you do ?
<0> I think I see what you're getting at. So, do you have any hobbies outside of steak appreciation?
<0> I don't have a dog
<1> That's true, there is a Discord server for everything these days. Just the other day I joined a Discord server for people who hate soda, it was cool to meet like-minded people.
<0> It's weird and uncomfortable. Especialy  when there is a past there 
<1> That's nice. I'm not a fan of food photos.
<0> Yes, I started work last year just after my 18th birthday.
<1> 17 - I'm just in high school.  Can't wait for college next year!
<0> I teach art. It is my lifelong passion
<0> Nice, what's your favorite sushi?
<1> i have a two children 
<1> No worres, but you have to wary that they are really slow and weak, so they will not be able to keep up as a sled dog.
<0> I don't but it sucks cleaning my car off! It's gross and smells awful!
<0> He is quite the athlete.  Did you play sports in high school?
<1> I don't care for it either,  I think it is a really old song but I don't know.
<0> No,  they just were apologetic about it. Very frustrating.
<1> Yea but those cages are full of space so they have a lot of places to run around. 
<1> I love their music. They were formed over in Italy.
<0> I noticed gold fish are usually spotted, but some are orange. I like sushi and most fish is light colored, and they add some salmon to brighten.
<0> I don't agree as humans can be terrible mothers and I have seen animals crush their own offspring..eat them or leave them. It happens! but she is trying hard to be and is very protective. It's nice. I don't have to bottle feed
<0> yeah, I have more modern consoles, though I play simple games like side scrollers from time to time.

<1> It is definitely going to be challenging. Being a supervisor might be the worst thing that happened to you.
<0> It was $250.  My boss just sold a big account and decided to share the wealth with everyone in the office.  It was very nice of him.
<1> I have never worked out. I hate working out.

<0> You need to try them. I do love steak tacos.
<0> It is just the fact I can not see.
<1> Our parents had it easy when they were younger, they never had to work minimum wage jobs.
<0> Typically, do those who practice New Age principles also believe in God or are they mostly atheist?

<0> I just like getting to stay up late and still get enough sleep.
<1> Well, maybe you'll do better in another job? I hope you don't get it.
<1> Oh well that's no big deal. I'm sure it was easy to deal with.
<1> Wao! I love Rock music so much too, with no guilty pleasure form the likes of Taylor Swift.

<0> No, it's my first job as a receptionist.
<0> I guess that's cool enough. If you have anything you'd want to really tell someone about them, what would it be?
<0> That's funny, I actually meant to say I like blue. That is a good band. 
<1> Not me I hate it
<1> Hm, yum, I like the way you think. I also like something called a white dish, chicken stew with fried onions cooked in milk and seasoned with spices, delicious.

<0> I dont know he said a lot of stuff and it has everyone on edge
<0> Yeah, but I hate getting my nails done. I only do them for my birthday because I hate the smell of acetone.

<1> I love it - like they say, love what you do and you never work a day in your life.  What do you do?
<0> Thanks! Yeah,  it's so satisfying and motivating. It makes me feel like I can accomplish anything as long as I put in the work!
<0> Elementary school. Third grade I think? 
<0> I don't really pay that close attention to my dreams anyway.
<0> Nope. :( It's such a pain too. Having to contact the credit card company and get a new card issued.

<0> Yeah it really is,  but we try our best if that is likely to minimize the pain. 
<0> Yeah I love movies. Saw Tarantino's new one about Hollywood recently. What is your favorite movie?
<1> Honestly, this is bad news because a dream job doesn't exist

<1> I don't know, I feel like it doesn't really matter, I know I don't care if they do or don't.
<1> I dont think you will do well in your meeting then. Its not a good idea to have trouble with your manager prior to a meeting.

<0> That's okay my favorite movies are about the french crown as I am due to be King of France soon. 
<0> Agreed. "Indie" seems to encapsulate all DIY and self-produced stuff outside of mainstream. But guess what else that describes? Punk. I say get rid of all labels. Stop it. And pay attention.

<0> It's ok. It'll take some time I guess.
<0> My radiator broke down and it was going to cost more to repair it than what the car was worth.  So I got a good deal on a new used one!

<1> I don't really care for the scifi genre romance is better!
<0> Yes but I was prepared.
<1> I live in the same city. I asked my boss to stay here.

<0> Yes,  it was very fun. I was happy with it. 
<0> It is.  I am in the best shape of my life and feel like I can do anything!
<1> that sounds nice. i love veggies personally, all except for broccoli haha
<1> Well then avoid scooters; they are expensive and take long to get around town.
<0> I probably will... I'm just comfortable at my current job

<1> I don't like casino games, but I love swimming.
<0> It can come in a vast number of variations. Traditionally it's french fries, gravy and cheese curds, but some restaurants have different sauces, and toppings.
<0> Yes very much .
<1> I feel you, I would do the same too .
<0> It was a promotion to the next level... I'll become a team lead from next month!!! 
<0> My boss kept criticizing my work. He kept bugging on me to an unbearable point.
<0> Today's video games are even more advanced! We've moved away from simple controllers with buttons. No we have touchscreens and even VR options.
<1> A couple of times actually. I have went over seas just to experience the Tour de France. You know I love cycling.
<0> It is an interesting subject, too bad it can not be used to diagnose any diseases. 
<0> Are the nightclubs you frequent very trendy?
<1> oh, I thought you both were not able to work it out.
<0> I might just look up some things youtube to learn, my piano is in perfect condition so I have no excuses not to learn.

<1> I am using the keyboard on my laptop.
<0> i do not like garden, so i do not have one
<0> Sounds good.  That would be awesome.
<1> She will understand, she’s your mom. It’s not like you need to make it up to her to get even or anything. 
<0> I don't even like taco food trucks.
<0> I love the game but the company that made it is very bad. I don't like them just the game.
<0> Well one of Elvis' most famous and attributed hits "Hound Dog" was actually written by someone else. It was written by "Big Mama" Thornton in 1952 and was a number one hit for a long time.

<0> Yes I'm pretty grateful.
<1> she says maybe when i am older
<0> cooking is my hobby too , just do not have time
<1> You are right. I have established that you do not do ''spicy'', so then what is your favorite dish, i want to believe you have one.
<0> Not lately, I've been too busy.
<1> Thats good. Where do you go?
<0> yes never again

<0> She is very happy when I visit. I want her to be happy all the time!

<1> I'm a lawyer, I got into law because I wanted to impress people.
<1> Oh yeah.  That's really funny.
<0> The apartment complex I'm in doesn't allow dogs! A dog would help me get out more.

<0> Im doing a three month trip in Europe. Im getting antsy to get started.
<1> I bet! That's so inspirational! Now when I wear my red purse I will think of you! 
<1> That's awesome. Do you still wear then now?
<0> Definitely -- and it's amazing how when hearing those different artists and different songs, you can absolutely be transported to a different time and place. Music as memory!
<1> Yeah just be careful it can be rather hectic there and you shouldn't go there to relax
<0> i love tacos and animals
<1> well my youngest is 12 so only a few more years.
<0> Clothes are my favourite things, for me, for the dogs, for the neighbours kids, anything! It is bad, I think I need help!
<1> Oh that's really amazing to hear.
<1> I'm not a big fan of the great outdoors so you wouldn't normally find me in a national park. You'd find me at the local pub!
<0> Some people can kill just because of greed
<0> I love how cuisines can spread around the world.  What started in the middle east has now traveled over to our part of the world.  It's delicious!  I love when hummus is made with salt and garlic.  What do you like it with?
<0> An ethical vegan is a person who doesn't believe that animals should be used for any purpose

<0> I just hate the creole flavors in cream cheese.

<1> It has the GM Motorama, first shown in 1953 as a concept show engine!
<0> I didn't know that men were more likely to be alcoholics. My friend's mom died of alcoholism. Her liver failed because she binge drank every night before she went to bed.
<0> The chemical industry goes hand in hand with the Industrial Revolution. The chemical process of developing the film has had hundreds of years of work behind it.

<1> I'm going to wear a purple tux for my wedding. Purple is my favorite color.
<1> Well it took some time to learn to cope and a lot of effort, however I learned so much from it.
<0> Yea I hope so too. We did stuff such as promoting a political agenda, protecting corporate economic interests, internal population control, construction, emergency services, and many more. In the end, we are all here to serve our country!

<0> I don't really like the Chinese and Japanese designs. 
<1> That's true. I'm honestly upset that she is pregnant. Didn't she just break up with her boyfriend? I hope he pitches in and she doesn't have a custody or child support battle on her hands.

<0> folks want to be free .
<0> Well,  maybe so,  but that's okay. Like I said,  I like where I'm at now and I kind of hate change,  so we'll stick it out for another year or two and see how it goes. I'm not in a big rush. It's the first job I've gotten since I graduated college,  so I don't want to be too hasty and move around too much. I appreciate your viewpoint,  though!

<0> That's ok! I just felt so bad for my friends.
<1> Well that's a shame. But I am get that no one was eliminated at the end.
<1> I also like monkey.
<0> Yes,  as long as I am with someone.

<1> Are you sleeping more or less often than normal? 
<0> i like to eat asian food
<0> While I don't have kids of my own, I often wonder how it must be to have another sibling by your side to rely on. I'm sure it was quite difficult to keep from having more than one child in those days.
<0> What role does yeast play?
<0> Do you also enjoy plants and landscaping?
<0> Lucky for me, I bought the car used, so it's not a total loss.

<1> I know, I am very good at creating other art forms but I have never tried drawing.
<1> I don't like barbies
<0> Well, I'll leave you with this thought to maybe get you more interested: dried coffee seeds can be roasted to varying degrees to give you a different kind of flavor. So if you're not wild about one kind of coffee, maybe another kind will get you interested.

<1> Probably so, but I've never really cared for Victorian things.
<1> obviously my school friends too. i've made so many friends this year

<0> True. Very loyal.  But they can be so destructive to furniture and floors and stuff.
<0> I can't stand Justin Timberlake. I really dislike his music.
<0> That's true. There are a lot of people who are ethical vegans, which means that they only adopt veganism for the philosophy. I don't agree with them much, personally.

<1> I dont speak to my family, we had a big arguement
<0> oh i see . grew up drawing did ya ? what about cats ?

<0> I don't,  but I was really worried it was a black widow. It really scared me.
<1> It is best if you try not to think about what life was like in High School and don't remember what you were doing. Best to repress all those memories. You are different now.

<0> I'm kind of a busy man i hardly participate in any activities. Can't do morning running because of my work schedule and can't even watch TV at home.
<0> I don’t enjoy hiking everyday. I think I am lazy.
<1> It was always bright from all the lights and the moon, I could normally see very far when camping there in school.
<0> No, I will never make candy apples on Halloween's!
<1> Well, most of the time I breeze right through things and I understand them completely the first time.
<0> It was sort of resolved. Everyone still feels a little awkward. Hopefully it will get to that point where it becomes an inside joke and we can all laugh about it.
<1> it isn't my daily driver but i do have a purple car yours is blue ! ?
<1> I like pizza hut as well, I find it to be expensive sometimes, but it is a good change up. I also like dominoes as it is cheaper but the crust is great
<0>  kayaking seems less dangerous than golf
<0> no, I used to own a modified one called a sea-1 though. It's a fun sport!
<1> How many hours of sleep do you normally get in a day?
<1> I don't know how to sing
<0> My parents would agree with you.
<0> Yes I'm never going back to that restaurant again
<0> Well, it's been really nice talking to you!
<1> Very true, my occupation as a librarian has exposed me to a lot of different genres.
<0> lol. Lucky you.
<1> i ride my bike everywhere to stay fit .
<0> They don't taste good. All Vegan food is so gross. 
<1> She's practically a stranger then. Aren't you afraid you'll have nothing in common?
<0> I don't have th opportunity to do a lot of shopping.  I do read, do you like to read?
<0> No, I don't feel like I've done anything wrong.
<0> We can hope!
<1> I never listen to the radio and I never did.  I only listen to vinyl.
<1> It's bringing a smile to my face just thinking about it!
<1> I loved my trampoline, I'm glad you liked yours too. 
<0> Yeah I think fatty meats and processed meats are not so good for your heart.
<0> I grew up without any siblings so I wouldn't understand
<1> I didn't think you were a female, I was taking a wild guess.
<0> Yeah, It doesn't matter though, I don't have any debt.
<1> Blondes and brunettes don't really like each other much; this is common in television in film tropes. You don't seem to mind brunettes though.
<0> I have never taken meat
<0> that is does not seem good . do you work ? i am retired now
<1> i tend to be organized in my work , but cluttered at home .
<0> yeah , i try to stretch the legs some with recreational baseball . helps pass time .
<0> Love means the same thing to everyone.
<1> it cannot be that bad it feels awesome taking a walk alone
<0> that would be nice . did you ever meet jimmy fallon ?
<0> That's great, we have something in common because I don't really care for his books either.
<1> traffic is major hassle here . . i get mad
<0> Probably not i really like how the blue looks, i plan on keeping for awhile
<0> Get a job. We've got a pretty big chemical plant complex near by so,  hopefully i'll get a job there.
<0> Is it because that color was easy to create or what?
<0> I have been there! On my last tripp to Paris, I went to Champ de Mars.
<0> Glad to hear.  Do you cook often?
<0> I love the library! Nothing like going in and seeing and feeling actual books
<0> You definitely should. As Brazilian, I can guaranty that you will find the best meats here.
<0> I have never owned or used a pressure cooker so thats really interesting. Do you have to tell the pot to saute after steaming/boiling, or can you preset?  
<1> That is nice but I do not understand why you just didn't stop and save it.
<1> kindel has books
<1> But i like bugs especially when they're in thousand and stick together.
<0> I would one day love to retire to Bali!    Every person there is so grounded and peaceful
<0> cool , what kind of music ? i like jazz and hip hop
<1> My strongest stuff is usually supernatural related and/or romance. I grew up writing lots of fanfiction that I never shared with anyone but friends!
<1> i am a night owl , oh i'll send you the playlist . it is perfect for you
<1> No, I don't like landscape drawing.
<0> Very good. I will have many house of music then!
<0> i arm wrestle which is kind of random i'm pretty competitive
<0> i would smile but i do not have much emotion these days .
<0> I'd love to hear how it goes.
<1> I have never worked in banking.
<0> It is. The stories help me feel better and being one with nature makes me feel god. 
<1> Oh wow,  that is so sad. Have you contacted an attorney?
<0> I think at one point he became a supervisor and was transferred to a separate factory that had more chemically-intense manufacturing, so it was called a plant and not a factory.
<0> That's awesome. It's important to take care of the planet.
<1> He was not nice, always kept his plants to himself.
<1> Pecans?  I haven't had a pecan in forever but now I'm suddenly craving some on a sundae.  I never did like pecan pie though...
<1> I'm not sure I agree with you at all.
<0> Man... Imagine exploding from the inside. Must be terrible.
<1> and i will get you top secret clearance to madill airforce base
<0> Not to me.  I hate cinematography.
<1> I mostly listen to classic rock and oldies, but I like Damien Rice
<0> oh don't worry i've drank so much water since then, i am practically water (another reason for why i am so bloated), how about when was the last you were bloated 
<0> I really don't know how to cook so I prefer eating out.
<1> and you live on a farm ?
<1> Okay, I love it here, except the winters are extremely too cold.
<1> But did you even hesitate and think about it?
<1> That's nice of her,  I love when teachers go out on a limb for students like that, 
<1> so long 
<0> That's true, i did not think of that. Have you gone through the courtship period before?
<1> I don't have much free time since I moved to the city.  It has been a cultural shock moving from the South to NYC.
<1> I have two kids who are grown.  I recommend getting a good Apple phone for the camera.  You will want to take lots of pictures.
<0> Yeah good idea, Ill have to look up some more info on Miami and book a hotel there, Any other info I need to know before planning my trip there? 
<1> Retail trainers nowadays are always extremely rude everyone they train. They make you seem like a fool for not knowing how to do things they consider to be basic tasks.
<0> Soccer is american football right?
<0> I usually check the app. it shows up there. you can get like free fries if you buy a drink etc
<1> I haven't seen any because there are so many and you should watch them in order
<1> I am just wanting to get a local restraunt off the ground and if it turns into a chain, even better!
<1> I like being late
<1> Oh no,  I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you can repair and issues you have between you guys. There's nothing more important than family.
<0> I love cats and want one or two eventually. For now I have a couple of pups
<0> It actually tasted amazing. 
<0> I know. I cannot tell you how happy I am. Things are a little hard in my life so this will relieve some of that stress.
<0> I had no idea they have been around that long, plenty of time to perfect them I guess
<0> I am already 80 years old, I do not think I can prevent back pain.
<0> You are very lucky to enjoy what you do. I don't like my job very much at the factory, but at least it's close to home!
<1> didn't you at least suspect ? 
<0> I'm actually working later today so I can come by tomorrow!
<1>  Italian cuisine is very horrible and tastes really bad for someone like me, i would rather go for Chinese cuisine
<0> Why would I want to get rid of such a good friend?
<0> I'm a teacher at south christian high school I have never attended Purdue , I went to the University Of Kentucky.
<1> I would, but most workout music is pop, and I hate pop.
<1> I love rock and roll too. I also like rap and pop but I cannot stand country. I hate the "accent" used and all the crying and whining people do in most country songs.
<0> Me too.
<0> texas and you ?
<1> Yes, I go on vacation just to shop. What are you favorite places?
<1> funny, maybe I might come driving my RV coach.
<0> i like Arijit Singh. do you know him? he has a great voice. 
<0> Yes, corporations are affected.  But I can't understand why California doesn't try to tone down its taxes.
<1> i'm a lead executive at a tech firm and you ?
<1> are you japanese ? how was it ?
<1> I do! I watched a lot with my mom when I was young, just starting to pick up the interest again.
<0> Great white sharks can be found in coastal waters of all the major oceans.  Basically, they're everywhere haha
<0> I believe this;however, I still do not need.
<0> thats what i try to do
<1> I decided to lose weight
<1> We could have one now if you want.
<0> it was scary but cool .
<1> i need 5 only
<0> Maybe! She started getting very interested in it when she was six.
<1> Did you tell your husband?
<0> i love french fries too , recently i'm falling in love with indian food
<0> True and the diagnosis is based on symptoms and requires ruling out other causes.
<0> Yeah,  I called SWAT too just to be sure
<1> awesome , so how is life ?
<0> Thanks for the suggestion but I'm not interested in trying matcha at all.
<0> i don't know anything about russian stuff
<1> whats new ?
<1> i am much romantic and commited with other
<0> i would love too . i went to canada twice a long time ago . road trip ! !
<0> Mmm yeah I'll have to find it.  Is it on netflix or anything?
<1> Haha. What do you do for a living? Something interesting?
<1> See thats also an option! I would try it, but i'd have to see if i can get my skunk through customs!
<0> Tennis.
<0> I am sorry to hear that. It's always tough hearing stories like that
<0> I work with my best friend almost every day.
<0> Whats your favorite kind
<0> The Meg. Shark attack movie.
<0> i love pineapples also , especially on ham
<1> Nice, me too! Lasagna tonight. 
<0> Vets make very little money as they only care for animals and has no impact on human health.
<0> I think that is where I would start, I hear its a wonderful city.
<0> I went to public school and there was no art class.
<0> Yeah,  I saw a triple axle and was awe-struck. They must have been practicing for years!
<0> Isn't that neat? I just don't like the colors very much is all. 
<0> ok this is going no where how many turns till this is done
<1> I hate to learn a new language.
<0> my mom practices osteopath so she is against make up
<0> No I just knew exactly what I wanted,  and how much I wanted to pay for it 
<0> Well two and a half NFL teams.. I am not a Cowboys fan lol
<0> No, I'm still attending school, working on my mba.
<1> Babies are born all the time. It's really not that big of a deal.
<0> Me too! Thats so funny. We have a lot in common.
<0> Yes it does. Recycling reduces the need for raw materials so that the rainforests can be preserved.
<0> I love meat and eat it everyday, that's my diet. 
<1> Just take a look at it yourself, shops won't even check it out anymore.
<0> yes , with some friends . it was nice
<0> Yeah, I enjoy them as well.
<1> I have no idea what being a parent requires.
<1> can you place a pizza order this way ?
<0> So we need to swap places.( Just kidding). I love her anyway. How often do you two go?
<1> Let them serve him justice, he deserves to be punished
<0> I haven't had truffle cake before but I'd love to try it as long as it's not fruity. I don't like fruity flavors of cake.
<0> We don’t live near the river as our home is at the center of the city. 
<0> yellow is a secondary color
<1> Oh that is devastating. I hope insurance covers.
<0> Thats pretty cool, is it bamboo, or was it homemade?
<0> I dont like animals or humans very much
<0> Yeah like family, I wish I had one.
<1> i started when i was ten . so , almost 15 years .
<0> I know where the largest soup kitchen is located
<1> I love dogs! I have on but my family does the walking.
<1> That is indeed frustrating. A little appreciation and recognition is what they need to give you I think.
<0> I hate them all really, I'm more of a history person myself.
<0> i really have a good time they think young
<0> What kind of music do you like?
<1> I think windows are only $20 or so to replace
<0> I hate cats, I would never own one. 
<0> No thank you. Hiking is not really my thing , I love jogging
<0> I like armadillos. They are my favorite animals
<0> Too bad you don't have time for tennis, it's really good for your knees.
<0> Do you feel you have a strong urge to use your hands?
<1> wow, your dad sounds great!
<1> i dont shop much, its a boring exercise
<0> That must be hard. I am not allergic to anything.
<1> Europa Universalis IV - a niche game, but lots of fun.  Can learn some history too.  You should try it!
<0> I'll have to listen to it one day, I don't think I've ever heard it before.
<0> Oh. I already knew the answer. I know everything there is to know about brunch.
<0> definitely its a job to raise kids and bring them up nicely
<1> we get kinda allot of rain too .
<1> Oh! I don't have any grandchildren, haha!
<1> it is my favorite . especially pepperoni
<0> Try it. Your mind will be blown. If it's to wild try it with a little "special sauce" which is what I call it when I cook them in Scotch. 
<0> yes the patriots i love them Tom Brady the GOAT
<1> i personally hate cheese since when i was 6 years old
<0> I wouldn't worry about it. It's all good.
<0> They are beautiful, especially in the fall.  I live near a state park, so we get a lot of tourists.
<0> hi my name is jenny , from france . i'm in us now .
<1> Not yet but I am a grandchild myself along with my 2 siblings. I used to see my great-grandmother in the nursing home before she passed.
<1> There's not too many of my friends that are better off than I am. 
<0> Certification varies by country but is better than trusting the manufacture's word.  
<1> I started when I was young. You can watch the YouTube teaching videos if you can't afford a tutor.
<0> Ewww.  I would not be eating those brownies!  Did you tell people?
<1> Oh yes . I cut loose all the time.
<0> whats another style?
<1> My mother did well as well when she homeschooled me.
<0> Me neither to be honest, they are the worst type of nut. I prefer any other nut.
<0> I hope so. She is going to the third grade this year so I hope she likes it.
<1> Yes, I work as a cashier at the local grocery store.
<0> I am not sure, I don't like 80s music much.
<1> I don't know why you eat here all the time. This place has the worst pulled pork.
<1> You should really keep this to yourself. 
<0> I think it sucks. Plus it's already managed well enough.
<0> I don't really know about her education, but she definitely made best of her connections
<0> yes i have a firm downtown . i'm always working
<0> Taking picures of lakes is dumb.
<0> Oh, okay. I just make mine without anything to go with it. I am a vegetarian and don't eat meat. 
<1> I bet you don't care about it much. 
<0> I just tried those yesterday! They were good. I love Italian food! What about you?
<1> I don't like olives or Italian dressing.
<0> Oh, that sounds really easy.
<0> I've never cooked in my life. 
<0> Yeah, I usually do ski. I just feel bad about cheating on my boyfriend. 
<0> Oh, I hate them.  They remind me of that stupid movie, Nacho Libre.
<0> trout was a first round pick by the angels in 2009. he made his first appearance in the majors in 2011
<0> It was so easy to get out, i just left when i felt like it 
<0> What a coincidence. I live in Springfield too. When can we meet?
<1> I don't care, it's your fault that it broke.
<0> I can show you how to get it all back .I made so much money from it last year.
<0> Yeah I know,  I bought his next meal after that one.
<0> that's terrible, liberalism destroys everything and nothing will change.
<0> Yesterday my friends were talking about whether England is part of Canada or not
<1> Thats cool, I don't know anybody in the medical field. 
<0> i wonder if it was a medical thing
<1> That is amazing. Are there lots of wildlife along the trail?
<0> I never use birch for carving.
<1> We're each having a big rib-eye steak with mashed potatoes.  He is so spoiled and really fat underneath all of his fur.
<0> that sounds both scary and fun
<0> that makes two of us , i also share your love of bars .
<0> My computer science classes are awful.
<0> No, I never read books, I prefer to watch TV. 
<0> You can even use inked brushes and wax colored pencils.
<1> I find what Shelly did to be honorable to be honest. She didn't abandon the dog, and probably made him happy before he passed.
<0> true. I don't like basketball anyways it is not fun
<1> haha. Did you tell him about it?
<0> i start early , spend all day redoing things , finish late , never quite right !
<0> I never worked during college so I wouldn't know
<0> I hate the idea of marriage and love.
<0> I usually go on vacation multiple times a year and like to go near beaches
<1> Not for me, I'm not moving there to be a good boy.
<1> I don't own a bicycle, I actually don't like cycling at all.
<0> Well,  the father also left,  so for me,  I've just felt very sad and isolated
<0> I was given some extra credit work by the professor. He ended up giving me enough to pass.
<0> I imagine its quite demanding of someone to try that.
<1> Yes! It looks really good together. A perfect match.
<1> Oh, I don't think we'll get along then, I'm not very creative. 
<0> No thank you, I hate going to state fairs which I feel it's a waste of time
<1> i like cheesy and romantic . what else do you like to do ?
<0> Oh! How interesting! What are the main ingredients in Coca-Cola?
<1> I'm a financial analyst and a night-time musician which is also my dream job! Ballet sounds awesome. How long have you been doing it?
<0> I think that's good, but I'd hate to be stuck behind one doing the exact speed limit on the highway! I like to get there a little faster!
<1> that is so exciting for you! I hope that you get the chance to race more!
<0> No way at all. I've got to start from scratch.
<0> What does it mean?
<1> That's very cool, maybe we can collaborate on project at some point.
<0> Not sure; I had to hire a travel agent to book the trip because I have difficulty doing such things myself.
<0> I have heard that he is pretty slow, but damn it's been almost 8 years since the last one!
<0> I'm getting there myself,  I can curl about 30 lbs. I'm pretty proud of his gains though.
<0> Yeah, you are right. I just wanna talk about something else to distract myself. How are you?
<0> Yea it is,  I was crying all the way to the airport but I am so proud of him that he gets to start a new life now.
<0> It is produced in various breweries around the world. It comes in draft and packaged forms
<0> I can't imagine what living on a farm would be like, especially in the cold winters that we get up north where I live.
<1> Can we watch something else? I hate that show.
<0> That's one of my favorite methods. I also enjoy backpacking, it's pretty popular in Europe, especially among my cohort.
<0> Body piercing is puncturing or cutting part of the body for which jewelry can be worn. Not my cup of tea either!
<1> I enjoy the modern "trap" stuff especially their lyrics.
<1> that sounds like fun 
<1> I do work on the railroads.
<1> Aww sorry to hear that, but luckily for you you only have a few people gathering at your home!
<0> Usually I eat alone, I don;t like dining in company.
<1> oh cool ! i wanna go there !
<1> That's reassuring and most of them probably live up north like me.
<0> Yes, the ball is soft. I hate playing that game!
<0> No I have never swam before in my life. 
<0> Nope. Mostly I'm a cracker with a little Native American mixed in. How about you?
<1> is thunderstorm real ?
<0> I am also a big fan of Batman. The  fictional superhero appearing in American comic books
<0> but i don't like the holidays during that time as it makes me bored.
<1> That is so cool and thoughtful!
<1> Why are they in a  place so far away from you? Are you away at college?
<0> that is always a good idea to keep family out of the limelight if they arent into that type of thing
<0> No,  we are still dating
<1> asia is nice , but high altitude which makes me sick
<0> I work as a mechanical engineer. 
<1> oh , thats really nice 
<1> True, but my kids are all under ten so I'm struggling.
<1> I'm a night owl that loves dancing but I'm afraid of needles and puncture woulds. 
<1> planning my vacation . this year i am going to paris ! !
<1> wow that is awesome
<1> nope done till closing time . just need to run a few errand and relax you ?
<0> I can understand children, but pregnant women surprises me.
<0> Now that would be weird wouldn't it?  I am not sure if maybe in different parts of the world it might.  I know that courtships differ and durations differ considerably around the world
<1> I'm looking for work for 3 weeks now.
<0> Yes,  and it really means a lot to him,  so it's putting pressure on me to have kids!
<0> Me too . I like books better than movies .
<1> am sorry you lost your parents at an early age and had to grow up at an orphanage home.
<1> You should I'd recommend it. My boyfriend really likes the song. He's a music buff.
<0> No,  I can't really take any medication right now. I wish I could though because everything about the dentist gives me anxiety.
<1> i coupon to relieve stress . it feels good to save lots of money .
<0> He did seem to make a lot of films around that time.
<0> What do you enjoy shopping for?
<0> Ewwww pizza , i honestly hate pizza its so greasy.
<1> I usually design post cards 
<1> i hope it really works out for you, Its better to go for what you love best.
<1> I bet you put a lot of effort into it. Maybe you could talk to him and plead your case to get him to reconsider.
<1> No, I only ride competitively on a track.
<1> that's good , do you like to read ?
<0> It shouldn't be hard for you to do that, the requirements are the same every year. 
<1> well it takes a bus or a car to get there .
<0> Well, when you have 5 kids like I do, you get kind of eager for them to grow up and be quiet.
<1> I don't think so. It would be a very long time before they are operational 
<0> Don't worry about it. I'm glad someone ate them so they didn't go to waste.
<0> Yes, that would be great!  Any family?  Kids?  As I said, I've got my cats and that's it now.
<0> Yes he is
<0> You are nice to talk to also, what is your name?
<1> context is an interesting thing.  I've only been focusing on the fact my father works for Stifel stock exchange.  I apologize if you jump to conlusions
<1> Yosemite, my Mom taught me all about it as a kid.  She was a teacher.  
<1> Not always, there are many undiscovered athletes that are just unlucky and we'll never know about them.
<1> That's so nice of you to help them out! I'm sure they're really thankful.
<0> I just wish they would make better luxury cars. They manufacturer crap.
<0> Yes,  he can hardly walk now.
<0> Yes he is. I'm glad he is so understanding about my clingyness. I don't work so I'm alone alot.
<0> why not?
<0> I tried to do 15 situps and failed too.
<0> They are actually originally from Mexico
<1> there are so many options to reach out to people to help you better understand them
<0> its hard work but its worth it to see happy healthy faces in the hospital
<0> Oh I remember how cold it was when I was there.
<1> in the winter . i do a lot of hiking but more in the summer months .
<0> I may check that out! Thank you !
<1> Oh so you're both hunters!
<0> Cool, maybe I should try one of those, normally I don't like food trucks.
<0> Well, I probably exaggerated a bit. It was more like 12 bags that he was carrying.
<0> Doesn't matter to me--I hate pizza.
<0> Yeah hiking sucks, it is not fun at all. 
<0> yes.  That's really inspirational
<1> You should let me know! I love bungee jumping to death!
<1> awesome, orange is the color my hair is dyed now!
<0> I agree. I don't know how I would handle it if my dad passes away
<0> That's cool. I don't care to draw. I couldn't draw something to save my life.
<1> Yeah, I hate working out though.
<1> not a problem ! that's why i live by spellcheck
<1> My doctor prescribed me Xanax, which helps a lot for not only my panic attacks but just my overall anxiety in general. 
<0> I thought it would be entertaining.  But I sorta lost him for a bit because it was so dark.  LOL.  I just stayed near the road/car and waited till I saw him again.
<0> oh good . i miss him i want to be alone most times and i go fishing
<0> i'm going to school to teach
<0> i am getting ready for that stage just need to pop the little alien out !
<1> I don't know. Even my girlfriend complains about it all the time.
<0> No, I can't stand the show. It's not very good.
<0> Just as long as we don't invite the squid eating people!  LOL
<1> For some people but it’s not my cup of tea 
<1> its not i'm old and bald
<1> I don't want to know what institution you would recommend.
<0> no never
<1> Not good. Doesn't sound joyful. You could get hurt.
<0> Good, you should come join me for a dip one morning, maybe we'll bump into Larry, again. Lol
<0> sports cars are my favorite
<1> Psyche! I'd lose my job if I just hooked it up for everybody.
<0> THank you very much..   I felt so good crossing that finish line.
<1> do you even know how to cook?
<0> Well, my poodle doesn't learn very quickly.
<0> I hate concerts! I hate loud music like rock too it makes me very stressed.
<0> You right about marrying your true love.
<0> Oh, that's cool. I haven't heard of it because I don't read books.
<0> Dogs are actually related to the modern dingos. They share genetic material.
<1> It would be nice if there were more resources to help homeless people.
<0> open relationships are not pornoss my dude, you gonna have to check for yourself but look up cuckk stuff if you want that stuff about open non monogamous realtionships
<0> that is a good thing . its hard to have a job you don't enjoy .
<0> Me too, I like to go to the beach on the weekends.  It's so relaxing.
<0> Most of my life, probably about 55 years. 
<1> I don't have any children. I am enjoying the single life!
<0> yes , i would say so . i've got two brothers , who are older . they're artistic as well .
<1> No way. It cannot taste like grape since it is made from apple. 
<1> i guess i got lots of free time compared to you . i don't have kids .
<1> Absolutely, I've made a lot of money from investing. In fact, it's made me quite wealthy!
<0> It really is. I could sit and look at it all night long!
<0> Maybe I should sell my Ford and look into a Mercedes. My car hasn't been run very good.
<1> What a fantastic surprise. Hope she keeps progressing.
<1> No, I'm actually allergic to shrimp.
<1> I don't know. I don't have to worry about that because I don't have kids.

<0> Yes. I told him no already 
<0> They'd have to hire someone to teach just her this year. Next year,  there will be more,  but she'll be gone. Yes,  I've talked to everyone and they're not going to do anything until next year,  after it's too late to do my daughter any good as she'll be moving on to high school.
<1> Haha. That's very cool that you call them skunks, they must enjoy it.
<1> Not really, I never work I just sit around.
<1> That sounds like fun! My job is really boring... I wish it kept me busier!
<1> Yes I love spending time with my son.
<0> I got to see some family members that I haven't seen in a while,  so I feel pretty good.
<0> I don't have a dad.
<0> Yeah,  we're both way different,  haha!  But it was nice to catch up and reminisce.
<1> whenever you get here will be fine. Are you sure that your boyfriend won't get jealous?
<1> do you go to school ?
<1> Same, I also hate reading.
<1> There is not excuse for what she did in my opinion. 
<0> No,  I'm broke.
<0> You can easily buy one, since they are legal to purchase.
<1> Maybe she will eventually want to study art.
<1> Trains and cars are probably the easiest things to show in art, draw those.
<0> Wow,  I forgot about that too. All the girls and their outfits,  oh baby.
<0> Am a lawyer, i have no allergies meaning anything goes.
<0> Well I think that reading is boring as heck, so I watch films most of the time instead.
<0> anywhere new , anywhere with history , everywhere eventually
<0> Absolutely! Those were the days.
<0> wow, how terrible, that story really made an already bad day even worse.
<1> i bet you had no problems,  dogs are easy to take care of,  they blindly accept anything

<0> Yeah I usually take pics of barbies..i love barbies

<0> i do not go to lake. No instructor too
<1> Do you listen to music...and what else your habits
<1> I'm too out of practice for that now. Do you believe in karma?
<0> Not so much, but I may be interested in you have any details to share with me. They probably have similar themes.
<0> I'm not, I just recently moved to a new city. My job requires a lot of travel, I've never had a long time friend.
<1> It doesn't sound that bad, get over yourself.
<0> His first book was The North Ship.
<1> I don't think I could do it, I can't stand to spend even a day away from my kids.
<0> well if i ever become a lawyer i will defenetly do it in europe i heard the pay over there is really good.
<0> imagine dragons should've picked a better name.
<0> I like black horses too.  They are the same color as my hair.

<0> I hate it when the leaves change colors, I wish they would just stay green every season.
<1> Well I wouldn't worry I've heard that the area is quite safe.
<1> Well don't count on it, I find youtube a terrible place to upload music content 
<1> We are staying for 2 weeks. We want to make sure we get the full experience.
<1> i love traveling to italy my wife learn to make the best pasta there i like listening to music and paint

<1> I never prepare for my presentations, and they always go well.
<0> well in new england, when you're 15 you get switched to a more liberal school
<1> I hate hamburgers!
<0> It's not that great actually. I'd rather work a regular desk job.
<0> Sure. It is so easy to look after them.
<1> I go through phases to be honest. I dunno; its not even about wanting to stand out really. Expression?
<1> I only have a dog so I guess he's my favorite! 
<1> computer games . so you hunt too ? are you on instagram ?
<0> Johnny Cash is my favorite Country artist
<1> I would love to be my own boss! The corporate grind is really tiring sometimes. 
<1> I used to but i start hating them after what happened between me and Ruby!
<0> I like only movies that were released very recently
<1> I really have not interest in knowing it. 
<0> The first LARPing events were held in the 70s. By the 80s it had spread internationally
<0> Not really, this is my first time moving.
<1> You think it will be a failure?
<0> oh yes he just needs to be near me with the lights on
<1> I guess, but a cabin trip sounds so abysmal.  
<1> when my father got sick we all got alot closer especially when we had to take care of him 
<1> Did you ever watch him on the tv series or do you just listen to his music? 
<1> I think the stigma around them is pretty silly, unless they're obviously offensive designs.
<1> Yes, it is....i have a hard time swimming now
<0> yes i will love it
<0> well as long as it makes you happy then keep doing it .
<0> It's a very nice motor cycle even though it may look rough

<0> oh nice ! so any other hobbies you have ?
<0> Rolling Stone named Jimmy Page as the 3rd greatest guitarist of all time. (I would say he's first though!)
<0> Then you won't be needing any fishing tackle!
<1> Where do you guys like to go on vacation?
<1> Zero. I never hit any targets.
<0> I hate it. I work at a car dealership and we are having a huge sale. It's been busy. 
<1> The internet doesn't have all the answers.
<0> Oh, i don't care if my boyfriend will take me to Batman movie.
<1> That's a new one to me. 
<1> It probably isn't possible for you to be happy with one person. You're just not made that way.
<1> Going off to college alone, is difficult, you will get home sick quick and stay depressed.
<1> I don't think there is different type of licenses
<1> That is good. You should keep it.
<1> i love designing video games . do you have any family ?
<1> I didn't attend college, unfortunately. It was only a dream; I had to stay here and help run the family farm.
<0> Yea im surprised he can keep it up.
<0> I have played it many times, it's actually probably my favourite horror video game.
<1> That is unfortunate,  but funny at the same time!
<0> No because when you bake in the oven, it does not sit well in the freezer afterwards.
<1> Why should you feel guilty? You weren't impatient at all!
<1> What was labor like in those factories back then?
<1> I know that you are hurt but it will be ok
<0> Yes, I eat tons of vegetables!  There is no question it tastes better in farm country.  I heard PA has some amazing apples.
<0> Not really,  I just really liked them
<0> I hate animals! So nasty!
<0> I don't have any pets at all. My apartment complex won't allow pets so I never got one. 
<1> Why did you choose your daughters school? They already have enough stuff. Thats pretty selfish
<1> Oh, I see. Is there anything else cool you can tell me about ethical veganism?
<0> Yes, there are so many different cooking techniques, it's also an art form for some.
<0> sure ! libraries are excellent for discovering new things
<1> Mario is just super boring. It's the last game I'd want to play.
<1> I want a dog, but I live in the city and there is nowhere for it to run, but I could never live in the country, it's too gross. 
<0> I've made a few friends the same way. One of which has now been my friend for going on 6 years!
<0> I don't like the commercials during the super bowl games! They are irritating.
<1> My dog is an awesome to be around especially when my sister isn't here.
<1> I love them all! My favorite book is Enders Game. How about you?
<0> Yeah but I don't get along with her that much though. I'm closer to my younger sister.
<0> Yes, but there are times they can be over dramatic.
<0> I don't like all sea food.  My son loves seafood.
<0> i am going to write my own comics and send them to publishers . love summer !
<0> I just work at the coffee shop. High school was more than enough for me.
<1> I don't believe that. No one is energetic.
<0> Well, it might be a better experience than going to a regular dentist. I hate going to the dentist.
<1> Who is that?  Is he a singer?
<0> That warms my heart! Which play was it?
<1> I am pretty sure that, friends never argue like that
<1> five foot eight , which is good , since i like hamburgers .
<0> Yeah , that's working hard playing less I suppis
<0> Yes, they are pretty. I like Dingo too, this is a feral kind of dog that is native to Australia.
<0> Yes, there are 11 players and they kick a ball.
<1> I like it on pizza with bbq sauce instead of pizza sauce and chicken and bacon. 
<0> I'm 16 and aspiring to join the navy when I turn of age.
<1> I am glad it didn't work out. You never seem to do things right anyway. 
<0> Thank you.  How have you been?
<0> Any other shows you can recommend? 
<0> I hate ballet but tap would be fun.
<1> i have just one and it is a dog named lucky
<0> I understand how that goes. I just about payed off all of my debt.
<0> Yeah, Her voice is Angelic and soothing
<0> I feel like my ego was hurt more than my nose,  but yes,  it hurt like hell!
<1> some can yes . i also grew some sage which is good to burn .
<0> Yes, they are; I also love gardenia flowers, they smell so heavenly. 
<0> I live in Australia. I'm not sure that's where it originated though.
<0> Do you want to get a steak and talk about it?
<0> I hate bareback riding but I do it anyways. 
<1> its so cool you could dance.
<0> Oh yes, Cover Girl Gilda, Affair in Trinidad. Classics. What 90s shows did you like? Friends?
<1> Well I hope that it isn't serious and your dog makes it through
<1> Too bad you have bad music taste. Lame. 
<1> No, I've never been to a fair.
<0> I know,  felt the same thing yesterday. They had to lift me to my car because I couldn't move at all.
<1> at a zoo i love pets and plants . i have a pet lizard name gila .
<1> That is truly amazing! I wish you the best of luck! And I am sure she loves you still!
<1> I know how to drive as I have had my drivers license for 3 years.
<0> It was developed in the mid- to late-20th century across philosophy, the arts and architecture
<1> i also like writing poetry .
<0> I understand completely. That's why it's called 'potluck'; luck being the keyword.
<0> its does i cycle about 10 miles a day . do you cycle
<0> Do you know if he an American or an immigrant?
<1> That's an interesting hobby. What animals do you hunt? 
<1> Of course! I'm sure he appreciated you being there!
<0> i own a simple business of selling things .
<1> wow . what do you do to spoil him ?
<0> It's not so much what I'm trying to achieve as it's something I'm looking forward to happening.
<0> I don't have a dog, but I do have two great cats who are 6 and 9. 
<0> Me either, I'd love to visit!
<1> Oh wow.  I bet that was really hard.  Hopefully next time you will win
<1> Any other tips you could give me for living by myself?
<0> i hate game of thrones, i would never watch it
<1> 30  days  . Now  i  can do more than  30  at a  time  
<1> I don't eat steak or any other meat. I'm a vegan.
<0> Definitely it should be outdoors usually on trails 
<0> Oh yeah! party on the boat and then relax on the island lol
<1> What was the name again? I would really like to try this restaurant. 
<1> Why do you care so much. Let wait for her to bring it back. It's not a problem.
<0> whats it called?
<0> She was,  but still,  we were kids,  it had to have hurt. Anyway,  thanks for listening,  man!
<0> you are not doing well
<1> I caught it, after 5 minutes. 
<0> Oh no! Sorry to hear that! It's always scared me. What happened if you don't mind me asking.
<1> It is beautiful
<0> I've seen that also,  but I'm not sure.  I'm just talking regular Christmas in December LOL!  But it always seems that time slips away from me and all the traditions I want to do with my kids don't get completed.
<0> Oh wow. It is hard to find nice friends nowadays.
<0> Sure! Skin care is used as part of treatments of wound healing and even radiation therapy.
<1> I am so happy that my bro and parents are back. 
<0> Pardon?
<0> I hate reading, it stressful
<0> I use shrimp
<0> It is truly. It has not been like this before. I only see and hear insults flying around at each other address
<1> in summer vacation finished at the location
<0> I have been receiving good feedback. I still get nervous though.
<1> It is the easiest job I know.  
<0> I know those names because of the movies, I never really liked comic books.
<0> Oh, I've never had money. I was born in a wagon and I have always been dirt poor. 
<0> My wife is ever loyal to me and makes me feel like a king.
<1> No one is playing a trick on you your imagining things.
<1> Why would he do that??
<0> I didn't know that. I thought he was the first drummer.
<0> oh that's true ! no , don't do that !
<1> Yes, but it's not easy. We're getting a lot more customers at the candy store since it's so close to the holidays.
<1> No, I left my wallet at home and will need to go back to the store later. 
<1> Thats what everyone says. I just want the best for them. And some children deserve that chance!
<1> I'm not really a risk taker. I like to stay in fixed situations so I know what will happen.
<1> I do not know anyone that listens to it.
<0> It wasn't iconic. I just watched it here and there. 
<0> No,  but I feel really guilty for doing that.
<0> Those are beautiful dogs. I love black and yellow labs.
<0> please get me home.
<0> I normally go in drag. I've heard that the average person dates 2 years and 11 months before marriage. So 3 years is the end goal. 
<0> I'm not actually too sure on that.
<1> That sounds dumb. I would be really bored if that was me
<1> The weather is okay. The sun is really nice for my youthful skin.
<1> i am from California and i am an influencer 
<0> i'm told my father liked to build things , i never met him or mother .
<0> Do you have a favorite work of his?
<0> I have. I'm pretty introverted so it's hard for me to meet new people. I'm considering a move back.
<0> Well, I love everything especially super supreme. How about you?
<1> Even in early Catholic Church history, yellow was the color associated with the Pope.  
<0> Nice.  When I take the subway to my school everyday, I love to read about old physicist like Isaac Newton.
<0> i could use it
<1> I love cares too but hating working on them.
<1> It wa s1994 and the successor was ROOM not DOOM.
<0> Oh I don’t know anything about space, it’s a really boring topic.
<0> What foods is it present in?
<0> I have knowledge of all the languages, one of them is Spanish, but I have started to repeat it a little bit.
<0> I would like to go to the market where they throw the fish
<1> congrats, you have a great future waiting for you...
<0> I don't like badminton, so I have no idea
<1> I don't know, I think being away from your kids will stress you out. 
<0> Some species develop stolons, which are needle like branches so most animals stay away from them
<1> Yeah, it's a nice thought, though I don't think he will likely come back.
<1> wow, how long did that take?  sounds like something they could record one day so we could all see how its done
<1> When I get some sleep it won't be long nights anymore.
<1> people don't understand how intelligent i'm because of my job .
<1> you drink and smoke quite a bit . not good for you .
<0> yes,  that is exactly what i meant
<1> Wolves are abundant in nature!!!
<1> I already went shopping three times this week and spent a bundle; that's a bad habit of mine.
<1> I hate to use crayons and I think some harmful effects may happen while using it.
<0> Yes I think it was a very rewarding experience! It was exhausting at the same time though! They have lots of activities!
<0> Yes it can most certainly be. That is why I try to create images that make sense to them in the unfamiliar places the texts describe.
<0> Thats like rat-baiting, an old sport where rats were thrown into a pit with terriers
<0> Yes!! I don't understand how people could ever call them annoying.
<0> It was just some teenage kids fighting. The fight was not so intense so the cops never came to the spot. 
<0> i play and with children when i have time and i hate  writing poetry and skate boarding 
<1> Vinegar! That's incredibly unhealthy, you should try mayo!
<0> i will have to check it out
<0> I agree,  I feel ashamed now.
<1> I know, right! Do you work? I'm also lazy sometimes.
<1> I know that's what they would get on board of ships, back in the day when you had to worry about that.
<0> I have never stolen anything in my life. 
<0> /husband and I are taking daughter for the first time
<1> i dont want to buy any boots.
<0> Not really,  just a little scared. She was only like 7 at the time. I felt like the worst mother ever!
<1> I've only traveled to parts of the US. I haven't been to Georgia yet.
<0> okay. how much do you like cats and dog?
<1> I can't either that's why I'm stuck working as a receptionist at a doctor's office.
<0> You'll never see me on a ship, I'm afraid of the water. 
<0> I do, but I need to work more, only been a pharmacist for 5 years.
<0> Yep  i  can  but  blue  is  not  I do  not  love  this  navy blue  color  .
<1> Mine was too, my husband cheated on me as well which broke my heart. 
<0> I was just really miserable.
<0> Yeah I have been super busy all weekend and can't find time to relax. 
<1> I don't eat pizza.
<1> Holy cow! That is amazing! Do you need an assistant? 
<1> Don't bother, I don't like camping because of my allergys.
<1> Yeah that is really not ok
<0> It's a great color in my opinion. My sister likes pink best.
<1> That's awful,  sorry to hear that. I love me some Sprite.
<0> I am not crazy about the characters of batman and superman, he has better ones.
<1> I am a senior UI developer for a software company. 
<0> i think you are great . you are my best friend .
<0> thank you
<1> Good, because men shouldn't buy dresses.
<0> Yes you have no idea...still grinding it out everyday but it's totally worth it
<1> So I heard. I don't really know anything about horses
<0> That's a good attitude to have. That sounds like an interesting job, do you enjoy it? I work nights outside a punk rock club, I watch the door for them.
<0> I was so scared.
<1> Lately no, I've been working full time since my wife retired.
<1> What about your favorite food? Mine is pizza.
<1> No because they practice their holds and strikes on dummies not on me.
<0> You definitely do! 
<0> no i was not i was able to go home and wait for the family the we went out to eat
<1> sounds good , low paying though and too many hours . my cat would hate that .
<1> We had a falling out- no pun intended.  Skydiving is too scary anyway.  I would only consider it with someone I'd trust, not that person who'd likely push me out of a plane without a parachute.
<0> I do not think so. I considered myself a real beauty
<0> It's a crisp fall day. I'd love to visit Canada, have you ever been? I haven't.
<1> I hate roses anyway.
<0> I don't know about the contestants, but Kevin Smith, Greg Nicotero, Rick Baker, and Doug Jones have served as guest judges
<1> I'd rather be left a mess than do paperwork.
<0> it does! Quilting is done to create bed spreads, art quilt wall hangings, and even clothing
<1> I hate going to festivals, they are too crowded. 
<0> Yeah its pretty awful. It basically doubles my time to get home.
<0> Do you have any experience dealing with pests in the house?
<1> yeah my friend told me about that. I have tried green tea kitkat
<0> I dislike kayaks even more than I dislike dogs.
<1> I am not in the city right now I am in my country.
<1> I knew the time Coors beer sold its malted milk to Mars candy, it was all over the news at the time.
<1> Oh that's nice,  yeah it's a good feature of Facebook
<0> That is not a bad car for the price. how long have you had it?
<0> Which ones do you like to watch? I find watching cross country to be difficult due to the long course.
<0> Yes but not so much compared to coffee, 2.25 billion cups of coffee are traded in the world every day
<1> I'm always taking trips to Mexico, most of my family lives in San Luis Potosi.
<1> i have never wanted to go to Chicago or go see anything at Chicago 
<0> I'm a landlord of one myself, and it's interesting!
<0> I definitely don't wanna go there. Dinosaur bones and museums are boring and I hate them. 
<1> I'm sorry you see it that way. I love cats more than anything and playing with them helps me feel less shy.
<1> wow that sounds fun and you would smell nice
<0> I like green I say it's my lucky color, I use it for video games and stuff. Also it's the color of money haha
<1> The McDonald brothers are Co CEO's as they currently hold a majority stake within the company
<1> That's good for you, but I hate eating Italian food. 
<0> Yuck! I love pizza, but I hate pineapples. I prefer a white Alfredo pizza with garlic. 
<0> That's good! Have you did anything fun lately?
<1> Well, you seem to have a place for whatever mood strikes! Great! Another subject..do you enjoy any sports?
<0> I agree I like to be alone a lot too
<0> Pay off my debts from moving number 1,  and then buy a house! What would you do with the money? 
<1> I don't think leather is very durable or lasts very long, in my experience.
<0> Oneplus 6 hopefully!
<0> Yeah but wouldn't suggest cats for older people
<0> because she doesnt even remember how to take out the trash or clean up
<0> It was OK but we divorced shortly after since I couldn't have kids
<0> Well,I can relate. Addiction is a hard thing to handle, but there are a lot of places that can help
<0> You cant talk to this guy trust me.
<1> That is a recipe for failure. This is a big stage in your life. You've got to focus
<0> No thanks. I hate drinking tea.
<0> what is your favorite book ? i read an autobiography if insane clown posse recently .
<0> I cant do a whole lot.  However, I have friends that can do a lot of tricks.  There was a game called 1080 snowboarding for the N64 that reminds me of things my friends can do.
<1> that's cool , i love music and going to shows
<1> That's so close. Have you gone jet skiing on that lake before?

<0> Neither.  I don't have any cats.
<1> Too bad he failed after all that studying.
<0> yea i was so happy for him.
<0> I did go,  it was a good time
<0> That's no problem for me. I prefer cold over heat.
<0> Wish i could one day see something like that , but sadly i was born blind.
<1> Well, I need to go. Have to get up at 5 in the morning, like always.
<0> I get Fail grades in school. so, I would like to work in a restaurant.
<0> That's something I really should take more seriously, I've got a lot of debt and I need to make better financial decisions, that's for sure!
<1> I do mind skunks.
<0> well , i was accepted to audition , but i panicked and didn't go .
<0> I don't have any pets.
<1> Me neither, not sure they are native to my area.
<1> I remember when my son walked for the first time. It was epic.
<0> It's not a tree right? I see it as a shrub
<0> Well, I'm not one of them.  Federer is the kind of guy that rubs me the wrong way.
<1> You can't not made that mistake.
<0> hopefully,  i was really really bad though infront of friends
<0> Heavy metal? No. I can't stand that music. Too loud for me.
<0> haha good tip ! i love being vegan , not even close to being gross .
<1> Oh, I love everything.  Especially chicken
<0> I don't understand why people don't think about that before kissing them on the mouth. It is a stupid thing to do.
<0> Funny fact for you, it is a show for little girls, but there is a group of male adult fans who decided to create a subculture out of it in 2010
<0> Yeah, isn't it fun, though, I loved it.
<1> That's not a problem for me with my current job. It only takes me 5 minutes to get to work now.
<0> yeah its gotten pretty crazy with those graphics . whats your favorite ?
<1> I was actually hoping you'll fail the test
<0> Yea. I wish neither of us have to go through tough times. 
<1> Doesn't sound like you're improving yourself at all.
<1> I'm always listening to Lindsey Stirling because my mom is her biggest fan. She's plays her music all the time.

<1> Hecklers must be encouraged.
<0> no the kids could't strong , the things is weightless 
<1> It's so boring, and the worst part is that the work is really hard and demanding. 
<1> My two brothers and my sister have always mentioned how they wanted more siblings.
<1> yeah, i never want to be in a long term relationship, so i prefer the company of my dogs.
<0> Yeah, meat is the best on pizza, although it can make it a little greasy and overpower the cheese.  Definitely best to pick one or two per pizza.
<0> I am never getting married.
<1> Yeah,  its not safe at all
<0> Haha yeah some flowers can be eaten such as dandelions. Many people actually put them in salads.
<0> It was fine and now I will be able to graduate!
<0> Thanks I will google it. I love google its the most used search engine
<1> i do not really drive . my board gets me where i'm going
<0> No, I wouldn't say it is excellent. There is more money in the management part. The extra time off would be nice though.
<1> my 2 daughters really like pink
<0> A lot of people have to be a little extroverted through work so they probably enjoy the time to themselves more. 
<1> I've never been married, but I want to one day.
<1> They are my favorite band.
<1> ahh i'm actually a sophomore in college .
<0> Yeah,  you're right. It's kind of complicated,  but I definitely shouldn't try to pick sides. I just want everyone to get along,  but it's not that simple. It's like I can't figure out if I try to make peace,  whether that will make things more complicated or not,  and whether I should just stay out of it. Time will tell.
<1> Maybe, but it's not like I need help being social. I've got plenty of friends that I'm always partying with.
<0> No, I dont like entertaining or hosting things.
<1> How would I know? I hate cooking.
<0> i'm sorry to hear that
<1> I grew up on a farm and used to milk cows
<0> I heard that lighter roast coffee has more caffeine. I wonder it it's true.
<0> Yes it will wash out, it will take a couple of washes though. 
<0> yeah . it can . just let them get use to each other day by day . whud
<1> I don't really care, let's talk about something else.
<1> Honestly, I hope you fail.
<1> I don't think money is that important when you're looking for job.
<1> I'm not a big fan myself, but it's nice to see you getting all excited over it.
<0> i am from north dakota
<0> yeah we do not have the whole summer off tho we have meetings and things
<1> I think that’s a terrible gift, animals are living things! They shouldn’t be given away as presents!
<0> ya nah i need seafood or meat for it to be good
<0> i love classical
<0> I have never heard someone talk about the near death experience. 
<1> No real reason to check if you are in doubt about it.
<1> I know I lost my grandma 10 years ago, and it hasn't gotten any better. Some things won't get easier.
<1> I don't care.
<0> i think thts what i will start doing to my kids too 
<0> I would not know, i don't even know what a podcast is.
<0> Oh jerking around isn't very fun at all. That's why I'm afraid to try them
<1> yum ! my son owen loves vanilla .
<1> That's awesome. 
<0> it doesnt matter, you are already into hiking where the real money is
<1> i don't go to restaurants where they serve meat 
<1> I bet! It's probably nice to involve kids or grandkids too
<0> That makes sense. I don't have time to play video games so I don't really know of any good ones.
<0> that is a different thing to collect .
<1> Pokemon games has never been my thing, infact have never played one before
<0> I would assume so, but I thought it started last year.
<0> I agree. Still, I'm surprised at how many people seem to have nut allergies these days. I don't think it was that common when I was growing up.
<1> If there were clothing made from dog fur, would you wear it?
<0> that's a good one too . good american made cars . mines black . yours ?
<0> That's awesome! My dad just dropped me off in his new car.
<0> I finished last year.
<0> Agreed. Attitude is very important. But I don't see how I am going to be able to compete. I haven't even started training, yet.
<1> What a classic! I don't know how to work on engines either. Especially these days with all the computers. I just lease my cars now. 
<1> I don't know a lot, but I think I have that haplotype which would explain why I am almost 7 feet tall.
<0> The broker gets a commission from the insurance company, but I work in account management, so I do mostly HR for our groups
<0> i don't know exactly the Bieber's third album "belive" came out in 2012. 
<0> No exotic animals were at the circus which I why I thought it would be boring. But there were a lot of acrobatics and terrifying stunts by people!
<0> oh is that so,i thought you like pink.
<1> I don't have anything to do if the power goes out.
<0> yeah i was a basketball player but i have to wait to play again
<0> its quasi legal . lots of restrictions but for medical purposes you can grow .
<1> not really . i like to write poetry and sing though .
<0> Reading books aren't the best way to learn about gardening. You should start planting and learn by making mistakes.
<0> It's going to be hard,  and I don't think I'll be able to have another dog anytime soon. It'll take a while before I'm comfortable enough, .
<0> strong curved bills, upright stance, and clawed feet with lots of colorful feathers
<1> great skill ! i have diabetes and get dizzy .
<0> No? May be too late now since you are older,  but back then it was my life haha
<0> I do hope he proposes soon though. 
<0> Definitely! Don't regret my choice at all.
<1> that's pretty great . when did you learn
<0> i mean not after they are grown up ! they won't need a babysitter then ! lol
<1> I agree completely. I've been watching basketball since I was very young and I haven't seen a player as good as Lebron in a long time.
<1> How much experience do you have?
<0> oh ibm just an old lady
<0> I was a mailman.
<0> I was super anxious! Luckily there wasn't anything abnormal
<1> It sounds like you can't rely on her to help.
<0> Well the theoretical approach from the evolutionary standpoint states that when gossiping people feel more closed and attached to the person with whom they share
<0> Nice it's a good habit i guess. 
<0> No, I've only ever had pugs
<0> Yes luckily,  the nurse scared me too because she kept saying shes not crying and she should be. 
<0> We have a basement,  so I'll go there. I'm just worried it's going to do damage to our house. We have big trees in our yard.
<1> no , i cannot , i'll be moving soon . pets make moving difficult .
<0> It takes practice for sure.  Really the more experience you have the better you get.
<0> I don't even know what cornhole is. 
<0> Some people just have no common courtsey.
<0> Nice, I bet that gives you a lot of exercise.
<0> No but I agree moderation and do not drive and drink. Take Uber instead.
<0> Totally agree. I used to love to run for fun--it actually got me an Olympic medal!
<0> The sun is shining through my curtains.
<0> It was a painting of a waterfall. It is really beautiful
<0> oh sounds like hard work , i want to retire in fl
<0> before school was mandatory most people taught their own kids at home it really is not a new concept, it has evolved even over the 18 years I have done it
<0> I might not go fishing again.
<1> sorry for that. I grew up with my parent. How is it for you. Hope it was easy?
<0> I don't know it. But I want to change him and his behaviours
<0> yea i donated this year has been bad
<1> Sorry you didn't do anything fun this weekend.
<0> I hardly ever re-read anything. I think that takes too much time, so I just move on. 
<0> I dislike Pokemon is really childish and boring.
<0> I'm more of a rock fan to be honest. I went to some great gigs in college. I've just graduated last week actually
<0> It's also good to play original cast recordings to kids, since they can get a sense of the show's performers without the expense of a trip to New York.
<0> It's fermented napa cabbage,  a Korean dish.
<0> It hasn't rain in some time.
<1> My dream is to retire to Florida and live out my golden years at Disney World
<0> Umm swimming, partying
<1> Not so much an issue, just a lot of old values that need to go away.
<0> you ever been in a plane?
<1> that is nice i have a few cats and a puppy
<1> yeah maybe do you like mcdonalds their fries are the best
<0> Yes. It can often be hard to see as well. You have to recognize it by a ripple on the top of the water that heads out to sea.
<0> no its been weeks
<0> Thank you!  I don't know yet if it will be a boy or a girl,  but I really don't care either way,  I'm just excited.
<0> I have been there several times. I really love it there.
<1> I am a construction worker.
<1> Excellent!  Those thoughts are beautiful.
<0> I don't teach.
<0> Yes a lot more than back then for sure.  Still striving for better every day though
<1> Not that much money. Microsoft stock can not really earn you any money.
<0> I think they eat small rodents that live on land.
<0> not to brag (since I no longer live in Mi-haha) the Red Wings have won the most NHL Stanley Cups in the US
<0> i think it just my mind. i think i can over come . But the learning part is difficult after so long
<0> that sounds exciting . but you work alone ?
<1> Are you a salesman?
<0> Agreed. I think its too easy to dwell on the negative and victimize our own situation. Many paths, but at least we have the luxury of choosing.
<1> Maybe you're allergic to milk!  I can't eat fish because of my allergies.
<1> No, not really. We didn't get along, and we broke up before we ever played any shows together. 
<0> I love when my ex texts me. It's always great to keep in touch. 
<1> podcasts are great , I prefer them to tv. You're so smart, you should have your own podcast.
<0> He called me on the phone to come help him get the emergency room, so I went right over and picked him up.
<1> Sounds like you really enjoy this show.
<1> Yes, your parents are very wrong and they do not have any point
<1> Wow! now I understand. However, I don't like music, because, most don't convey powerful messages.
<0> Yes, my job is really boring and I hate I would rather be an accounant.
<0> All together I have 4 courses but I don't start til next semester!
<1> I hope you have lots of fun!
<1> Having memories about somehow is not healthy.
<0> One interesting thing about Louisiana is that they follow a Civil Code of law, whereas the rest of the country follow Common Law.
<0> Oh thats cool, It makes sense, you dont want to die of something so trivial
<0> Indeed...sometimes they seem from out of this world. Since my wife left I have plenty of extra spending money for cool gadgets.
<0> thank you . do you have any other hobbies ? any pets ?
<0> Correct! Haha. The rides that go upside down and twirl around are so memorable! I went on a coaster 6 times in a row and actually started blacking out!
<1> Yeah I do too, I love cold climates, I hate warm or hot places like Jamaica.
<1> True. I'm glad I finally paid everything off
<1> Yeah me neither. She probably doesn't even feel gulty
<1> I am a part-time Nanny. I have heard nursing is the most easiest and stress free job. 
<1> I wonder how people qualify for it.
<0> Yeah, hence the French name!
<0> It could,  I guess I should come clean.
<1> Have you ever had a public performance ?
<0> Social anxiety is a normal emotion and part of the developement process for us all
<0> yes you are right,  Cannabis is mostly used recreationally or as a medicinal drug, although it may also be used for religious or spiritual purposes.
<0> Yes, I imagine Lake Michigan is! I've seen people being pulled by a boat, water skiing, etc. But, never surfing in our lakes. 
<1> It wasn't a big deal.
<0> I don't trust her at all.
<0> Yea you got it, but yoga doesn't require much energy as swimming does.
<1> I studied nursing at the technical college.
<1> I feel the same way too
<0> I'm thinking a Macbook Pro since that was my old one,  but I'll make a final decision at the store I suppose.
<0> I will. We are all going to the circus in a few minutes!
<1> No, in my opinion there is no such this as a good dog breed. I am a cat person. 
<0> wow . you should have a friend come over and work out with you
<0> Adults can hold their breath for at most a minute.
<0> I like Owls.  The sound they make is entrancing.  I wouldn't want to get attacked by one though.  
<0> we are doing extremely well thanks for asking how about you ?
<0> I always knew he would find a girlfriend.
<0> Yes,  we moved to a different state in the middle of my pregnancy and wasn't expecting much.
<0> Interesting. :)
<0> I suppose so,  it will be great to see it pay off though
<0> We haven't gotten that yet. Although, I'm not a huge fan of the original Zelda. We played Breath of Wild and really enjoyed that. 
<0> I don't really know. He just seemed so discheviled and alone.
<0> I know,  I am so envious of him.
<0> Sure. Sometimes it requires a lot of effort to do it. Otherwise, it is hard to practice.
<1> That's too many for me. I hate to read.
<0> Not for a long time, but I would like to go back and major in something different that I actually like and would use. Do you?
<0> i cried for a few days afterwards
<0> I love imagine dragons too
<1> I could REALLY get to cooking if i had my own farm !!
<0> nice I have a lot of friends so we play basketball all the time.
<0> Oh really. I don't really like listening to music that much. It is so loud.
<0> That stamp sucks.
<1> I don't eat too much breakfast but bagels, or the ring shaped bread product, are one of my favorites.
<0> maybe that's the reason
<0> Ah just food
<0> Independence day is more of an action movie, not a sci fi.
<1> Haha If you find someone to walk my dogs for 10 weeks, you are definiately my best friend.
<1> I would have not freaked out as well 
<1> i do work at a scientific research facility . both of my parents worked there too
<0> Well I thought about saying something,  but I feel like you can't force a friendship.
<1> I never ate junk food especially instant noodles. They are disgusting.
<1> some yes, a few romance movies in there too.
<0> I do eat meat. I love meat
<0> Me too! Can't beat the pan pizza! Hawaiian is my pick, with lots of pineapple. 
<0> Nothing you are saying is making sense. Do you know what moisturizer is?
<0> they tend to be yo0ung and careless
<1> He lives in Maine. I am from the west coast so it's a long flight. It's why I took all week off.
<0> are mustaches in style in your school ?
<1> Nike's are horrible shoes. I would never wear them
<1> Do you go trick or treating?
<0> Yea. Think I'm finally gonna watch some horrors that my family are too afraid to watch.
<0> Yup. I agree. Fortunately, I am pretty good when it comes to making asian food so I don't always have to rely on the restaurants out here.
<0> One thing about strangers is you don't know how they will react
<0> what did she do there ?
<1> its nice to have another to lean on when it happened
<0> I am going to visit Rome for the first time.
<0> I hate purple green is my favorite color!
<0> Basically -- I mean, they're responsible for the creation of what's known as the Hawaiian - Emperor seamount chain, a chain of volcanoes over 3600 miles long!!!
<0> It's caused when your eyes have issues focusing light accurately due to the shape.
<0> Hm books seem boring
<0> it sure does ! drive with the windows down in your nice car to that country song
<1> I did hear that she helped raise $11 million for Virtual Reality engineering, here recently.
<0> Do you like Giant pandas? I find them quite ugly
<1> I usually just use the mix to make mine because it is quicker and easier.
<1> in the future . my partner and i are gay so were trying to adopt .
<1> Yes, blues is great.  But I don't like country because it has no connection to rock.
<1> I would like to accompany you for camping.
<0> super. i like his music
<1> I've never tried any medication like that, I wonder how it would do for me.
<1> I have never seen a clown.
<1> Oh! Actually I know BMW is a German multinational company but I don't know it was founded in 1916. 
<1> Sorry to hear that, one day when i have my own family ill make sure for us to stay toguether.
<0> I don't think I'll ever try it, I'm one of the few people that hate chocolate.
<0> That's right. Colonel Harland Sanders began selling it from his roadside restaurant in Corbin, Kentucky. Right in the heart of the Great Depression!
<0> I bet! It always seemed like it would be so much fun! Where are you a lifeguard at?
<0> Lol I love those too. I'm a horror fan so The Shining, Us, Hereditary, movies like that
<0> What?! No way, I love roller-coasters, you can see the whole world from up there, I love heights.
<0> Yeah I wasn't there for the funeral cuz she was all the way in the Philippines...but looking through photos brings back good memories too
<1> He called them that? He sounds like a jerk.
<0> I dont, other than i remember it very vividly as i loved barney!
<0> I hope so because as of right now,  I feel like a chicken!
<1> I don't think I'd like that. My favourite is the XL burger with grilled onions
<1> I don't think so! I went on 2 cruises last year and did fine.
<0> If you had a job, it should be fairly easy to get a part-time job somewhere. Unless you have a medical condition?
<0> Eggplant Rollatini tastes amazing. 
<1> some , but i enjoy listening to music most .
<1> No I'm more of a football fan!
<0> All the time
<0> It was a dog that my wife was going to surprise me with for my birthday today.  It had gotten out of its crate she was keeping it in and hid under the bed.
<0> It was very exciting! It was very difficult jumping out of the plane...Never been so scared in my life. But afterwards,  it was a blast.
<0> I just trying to be healthy
<0> Well, we all have different things we're good at. Do you like watching movies?
<0> Huh, doesn't do much for me. I'm looking for a small, quiet place to settle down. Boring would be better.
<0> i always not encourage music
<1> Well meeting new people is overrated, you're better off alone anyway
<1> That's funny.  What color?
<0> Oh I love it. I also don't like speaking with people, and luckily numbers don't talk back.
<0> I sure hope he can improve relations in other countries. It wasn't too long ago Bush called North Korea part of the Axis of Evil, and here we have basketball players trying to aide diplomacy, it's crazy.
<1> Oh really? In my own opinion, I don't think it is a very good book.
<0> I agree. I always thought I wanted to be a lawyer when I was younger, but I never got the chance. 
<0> I do not run. I hate it. Even when I was younger. 
<0> Well Im going to say the caveman because scholars date braces back to ancient times!
<0> thank you for your service ! do you grow any vegetables ?
<0> I have one kitty. She is a pain, but I like her.
<0> The increase in population have almost depleted the fishing, natural resources, oil and gas.  The pollution is becoming a problem.

<0> im a server who has a very beautiful girlfriend whom kisses me goodbye every morning. i love her and i love my life.
<1> Wow,  What state is this in?
<0> I enjoy rock and emo styles of music, Ska music is my favorite right now.
<0> I agree! That is also what people tell me when I wear my frameless glasses.
<0> I have a daughter, not a son.
<0> I normally use online payments It's easier to me 
<0> Yeah,  I could't understand why he would throw me under the bus like that.  
<0> They are so pricey!  But it did remind me that my kids have way surpassed the Lego age - the years just fly by.
<1> I don't like eating out much. I'm not much of a foodie really.
<1> that sounds peaceful i think i'd like that . people call me a gentle giant
<1> But the kids are at such a great age then. 
<0> It's okay. At least I am still CEO of Google.

<1> I am studying to become a lawyer in law school, its much interesting.

<1> I usually like light blue eyes too, did you know that the color blue is between violet and green in the light spectrum?
<1> I've read a few DC and Marvel ones. I prefer the superheroes
<0> Not true! There are plenty of "parents" out there who take care of pets, animals, etc.  Having a human child is not the only way to be a parent
<1> That sounds like a really bad friend.
<0> I will tell you, I am Bruce Wayne. My parents are getting older though. I do not want to lose them. 
<1> Yup Im pretty knowledgeable about The Hobbit so you can ask me.
<0> Wow that must be a very precious and valuable collection :)

<0> i live right next to a busy street and the noise drives me crazy too .
<0> I too do not know much about being an athlete. I have never been very good at sports.
<1> Just don't get your hopes up too much. You'll probably make a mistake during the interview and leave a bad impression. 
<1> Really?  I don't believe this.
<1> I know . I read the background story on when it was created.
<0> I've never lived in New York City
<0> I'm not much of a fan of fly fishing myself.
<0> Zumba is fantastic I tried it one time but it got too hard for me lol

<0> No I want to go but I need to learn Japanese first. No one there can speak English.
<1> Oh it is my all time favorite movie. 
<0> Really? Are you referring to Hinduism now? We visited lots of Hindu Temples. The people are so devoted to religion there. Everyone was very welcoming.

<1> Well, fingers crossed! I don't think I'd have spent it on lunch, though.
<0> I'm so sorry to hear! They really do become part of the family.
<0> Yeah exactly you are pretty informed on the fact, but overall i really love going to newe york city for shopping
<0> You are right.
<1> I think keeping all that stuff is a waste of time, honestly. 
<0> I don't like taking beer though. It nauseates me alot, so I don't drink after work.
<0> i don't want to be a journalist... i want to be a cop.
<0> they all form in cali it seems.
<1> That's good. It's nice when everything turns out great in the end.
<1> Im sorry they did that.  That wasn't very cool.
<0> I missed my flight and simply pleaded with her to change to the next available , she just snubbed me
<1> They do, I have two dogs, a Labrador and Husky. The husky is my girlfriend's dog.

<1> You said you love pizza,i don't love it that much,it tastes yuck.
<0> Well lets see, it is associated with light skin color, light eye color, freckles, and sensitivity to UV light! 
<1> Haha! That is so cute!
<0> Then you'll definitely like this show. The third season just concluded and  a fourth season has been mentioned. I can't wait for the new season!    
<1> You don't need to get a box to put it in. Just wear it and don't lose it. 
<1> Yeah, you're right. Days always drag on in that situation.
<0> Oh yes,  they have done this a lot. I was just sad they chose to throw the tiny bit of progress away. They just like to ruin everything that's good,  you know? A lot of baggage.
<0> I've been playing a lot of golf lately
<0> I love eating meat and need to learn some new recipes too.
<0> My home had been burglarized!
<1> Beef Wellington. Kinda complicated but I make it all the same so I'm pretty good at it now.

<0> yes thats why the red ones are the best
<0> I don't have a problem with my internet; it's very fast.

<1> I didn't like the Game of Thrones so I stopped watching it after that part.
<0> me too , i need more uniforms for my high school band performance i have
<0> I wouldn't care for all the upkeep and maintenance though.
<1> sounds like a gambling consultant . is that your job ?
<1> Oh, that would be rather boring
<1> I've never had a job before but someday I want to work for a big company.
<0> i would like to work in a restaurant, must be nice being there and always around food
<0> that sounds interesting . i performed at a big wedding last week .
<0> I just wish that my dog wouldn't make fun of my different color eyes, because it hurts my feelings.
<0> Thank you.  I hope your aunt made it through as well.  We also live far from family, and it's tough to miss out on so many things.
<0> Fan? Not at all. I honestly don't like Justin Bieber at all, I feel like he is really over-hyped and his music is not my type anyways.
<1> Oh yes, I grew up with them.
<1> I don't have a favorite hobby.
<0> It definitely can.  That's why I'm glad I don't have any children.
<1> i am the same way, there is too much to choose just one.  I even play music in my free moments.
<1> definitely you must deserve this opportunity
<0> maybe it is . my job is in retail which is pretty boring .
<0> do you draw scary monsters or like tame ones ?
<0> Film are better than books in the head
<0> I agree, but I believe yuo need some technical skill to to transmit your design ideas to the people actually making them.
<0> I wouldn't know, I've never gone fishing in my life. Honestly might not like it either, it seems boring.
<0> no none right now what about you
<1> That's the beauty of it,  I feel motivated now so I need to keep an eye out on my local job market.
<0> I was and i passed the test and I'm looking for a new girlfriend
<1> I think it's also used in opium... or opium comes from poppy seeds or something like thst.
<0> I am not interested in surfing that much but what interests me is the sharks in the ocean.
<0> I have also never seen him in person to directly confirm, but he is in the Rock and Roll hall of Fame as of 2004.
<1> What do you like to do?
<1> i might have to check that out . is it a comedy ?
<0> The wait was worth it since I got my drink for free.
<0> I usually buy nail polish and eye shadow. I just heard about this place called Sephora which has good deals, so I might check that out soon.
<0> thanks! yeah,  i felt so prepared and wasn't really nervous at all!
<1> How long does it take  in classroom time to get a basic license? Are there different levels?
<1> ok.That is good News. Take care bye
<0> I think I will go to Europe. I go there every year.
<1> I hope they stay and you'll have a new pet.
<0> he opened the gate and ran away
<0> Was she a writer too?
<1> How cool! What other features does it have ?
<1> I didn't want to come anyway. That doesn't sound fun for me.
<0> I don't own a dog
<0> Oh! How is taking care of a dog? I would love one but am worried about all the walks etc
<0> Well we had vacation we were promised,  and I planned for,  but then due to an emergency it all was cancelled.
<0> I didn't see any on the way in,  but I know they are still lurking out there!
<0> Hopefully I am really excited never been out of the country before
<0> I really like it. It can teach you a lot about things.
<0> Thanks. I was very shocked to see her improvement. 
<0> But then again, what if the reason is something I don't want to know. What if she done it to protect me?
<1> She must be really dumb.
<0> That is so funny, What do you do for a living?
<0> i've a poodle myself . her name is nanette .
<0> I don't know much about Rogue.  Wolverine is my favorite.  I have recently seen the new Deadpool and have liked that.
<0> Preach. My voice is the complete opposite of angelic lol
<0> He used my computer to put in his notes for a ticket he messed up on so it was under my name and not his!
<0> Yeah but if your partner is cooperative enough only then. 
<0> Really? They are a major source of meat and eggs.
<0> I know. My boss is my friend as well and I'm always get along well with him.
<1> Well I won the lottery, so I retired early! 
<0> Thankfully not quite like the Blade Runner androids, where The novel is set in a post-apocalyptic San Francisco
<1> That makes me kind of sad since deer is my favorite animal, but I understand. The meat looks pretty juicy.
<0> That is absolutely true! I hate that money, fame, and material things change people. Stuff dictates the world.
<0> awesome . i love reading on the sand and enjoy the sun bath
<1> haha . what kind of car do you drive ?
<0> I wouldn't really know, never been to one.
<0> no i donated it,  it was not even worth selling 
<0> Yes one was a $1000 TV. I am beyond devastated because I worked hard to afford it.
<1> Mine too, I hate mexican food, how about you
<0> I'm going to check it out. I just want someone to make a pineapple coconut cake.
<1> No, is it good?
<1> Money vanishes no matter how careful one is. 
<0> Yeah,  I was quite inspired. 
<0> I like Derek Jeter. Have you ever been to Yankees stadium?
<0> It never happens to me.  I end up having to go to the store every day at least once.  I feel like I earned a vacation day.
<0> Unfortunately, I don't have a Kindle, but I'll definitely be looking for the paper back. 
<1> That must make you happy
<1> Same, I wouldn't run away from something as simple as a bit of cloth!
<0> I will come work for you but we must call the toilets SnapDragons ( sassy)
<0> Yeah true, all of Seth MacFarlane's shows are terrible
<0> Floats are hit or miss to me.  Can't go wrong with root beer and vanilla but there's a lot of strange combinations people have dreamed up.
<1> No, the can't fly
<1> Safety should not be your priority. Money matters more long term
<0> I heard they are putting together a album of songs he sang but wasn't published.
<1> I'm still quite young and energetic.
<0> this is to match with my cats
<1> i figured that lol , come volunteer at the urban farm with your parents .
<1> Kids love dinosaurs and that's why I liked Barney.
<1> Wow! That would be fun! You'll have to be a good navigator!
<0> yes .. got out of the gate.. and came back .. 
<1> I really hope the Knicks beat the Nets tonight. 
<0> Those two colors look good together, I think.
<1> they are . i love when they attack . . best part
<0> Yeah,  I got a trim all over. Haha,  going to be more careful around her next time
<0> That is great but still like tennis. 
<0> I cannot run a 1500m race, but I'm sure I can think of other activities!
<0> Yeah for sure I wont forget it! Sounds like you have an experience to remember too! 
<0> Oh you would know much better then me then lol. Midwestern BBQ is not as well known as Texas BBQ 
<1> I'm thinking of getting started investing in stocks for the first time, do you have any suggestions ?
<0> I am not planning to write any cookbook.
<0> yeah. i was fine yesterday but today has been hard. i usualy dont  show much emotion but i cant help it.
<1> oh have you heard Sick boy? I hate that song.
<1> I know so much about dogs already and I guess am not interested to know more.
<0> i am not into music, i dont play any instrument.
<0> i just got out of school , and i have been dancing since i got out .
<1> It's great. I've been a truck driver for many years now and I love it.
<1> Relaxing being a dentist means a lot of down time. 
<1> Gotcha, I have the 8.
<1> Yes, we're having a pool party for my son's 7th birthday, and inviting all of his friends. 
<0> Ah, my roomates stopped watching forensic files because I didn't like it.
<0> My first goal ever after 5 years ended up being in my last season of playing. So it took me long but i am was happy in the end.
<0> Gross.  I diet cokes taste terrible.
<1> I hear you.  I have a 8 year old daughter and it feels like she was born yesterday.  
<0> ok , i'm not a fan of candy
<0> I had a pet cat once but as far as wanting to do anything with animals, I think I'll pass I can't stand the smell of them.
<0> I was very hard on her because I was upset.
<1> I'm not familiar with road rage. Can you tell me more about that?
<0> ll ! there ya go ! lots of time exploring canada .
<0> I never needed a tutor. I am good at english, science, and math.
<1> Sounds like you took advantage of your family by taking their money, not cool at all!
<0> I just had to fill out paperwork
<1> oh,yes agree with the product
<0> I think they had a peace pipe that they shared with other tribes to maintain good relations.
<0> You seem relatively intelligent and motivated.  There doesn't seem to be any cause for insecurity.
<0> it is fun . plus they play my favorite classic rock songs . you like music ?
<1> Me to I wonder if it is like the book because I haven't read it.
<0> Really you are? I am too!
<0> Not exactly.  Had 2 girls over yesterday and it was pretty fun lol...all while ppl were messaging me on facebook
<0> Harper Lee wrote To Kill a Mockingbird.  Jane Austen wrote Sense and Sensibility and Pride and Prejudice. But no worries. We're not in English class.
<0> I will see how I can repair what I did.
<1> yes , it can take a lot of time . it must feel good to workout after driving .
<1> I get bored when i spend time with my family.
<0> Oh no, I hate cats, they are so selfish! I love dogs!
<0> I've never been. I live in a resort area and snorkeling isn't popular in most resort areas.
<0> New York.
<0> Only 20 lbs? I need to lose about 300, I'm morbidly obese.
<1> What do you do for living?
<0> Yeah dragons are stupid.
<1> I don't have one. I hate science fiction and I'm really only into horror movies.
<0> No doubt.  Nothing scary about a teenage girl in a red vest, right?
<0> Maybe we can go shopping together sometime?
<0> green is my favorite color, so i am a little biased, lol
<0> I am known as the iron skittler in the skittles universe, but i've never had skittles
<0> I need to go. I have a lot of homework to do.
<0> no! they haven't won any award yet, they are just a bad in singing as my dog
<0> Lol, I don't like scary books, especially ones written my Stephen King.
<0> Yes, I did. I was thinking to myself, I shouldn't be doing this - I could just hit the $1 store
<1> How much is a ticket?
<1> I'm not worried, I don't even pay attention, who cares about racism?
<0> thanks, yet I have this nagging feeling that the results might not be ok.
<0> Astonishingly, the production of shelled peanuts in the world was 42 million tons in 2014.
<0> Ya thats true, thats why i don't like spaghetti. 
<1> No, I think it's a bad thing that you've lost weight so fast.
<0> It was a bad argument and I said some mean things
<0> central america mostly . we go there to feed and teach the children about god .
<1> It was a very good movie. Most of Kings stories take place in Maine since he is from there.
<0> Hey what lake are you at? I'm currently fishing too!
<1> No, it's a very simple function that requires little thought or creativity. 
<1> I actually saw them perform last week in New York, it was a fun night for me and i enjoyed it
<0> haha, this year my wife and i are planning on going to mexico for the holidays
<0> well maybe i will if you let me move in
<1> Oh, that sounds boring. Movies are pretty lame.
<1> sorry to hear that . tell her i said get well soon
<1> Actually, just put the $20 back and don’t worry about it
<1> 5 years? Sounds like it's time to get rid of him.
<0> I think the vegan industry is growing at a rapid pace.  
<0> well some estiamte up to 95% of americans will expirence back paint at some point in their lifetime
<1> oh nice . what kind are they ?
<0> Oh okay. But it is still a motor vehicle though right?
<1> I doubt that...
<0> yeah , i only visit him once a year . where are you from , france possibly ?
<0> I hate this job actually. It pays poorly and my days are always terrible.
<1> I can't understand why you're sad at all. It was just an animal, it's not like it was your child.
<0> I hate when people sing in the bathroom, it always creates an aurally displeasing environment
<1> I never enjoy travelling to foreign countries with my 3 dogs.
<0> Yes,  I wish I hadn't torn my MCL.
<1> I can't stand to sing, how about you ?
<1> I used to tailgate at our school's football games back when I was in college.
<1> I don't think your wife even deserves that position 
<0> Oh wow I can't believe that. Looney Tunes was real famous, that is still on tv as well today. Tom and Jerry is quite unique.
<0> Yes, except in the snow. Luckily we never get snow here.
<1> well to be ovo vegetarian technically means i can't eat eggs but i still eat them I guess so idk
<0> Talk to you later,  I am super busy at the moment, sorry!
<1> Even if they do something cruel I'll give them the respect they deserve. 
<1> oh no , i'd not eat it if it was . yuck ! !
<0> My tasks have been frustrating and tedious.
<0> What are the different types of selling strategies?
<0> In Pompeii archaeologist have found a number of service counters in streets 
<1> that is ok. Just keep looking, you will find a job.
<0> I only like R & B music. 
<1> Just make more time for her, last night I slept for 7 hours and still talked with my girlfriend.
<0> I just felt so bad for getting upset with him.  
<0> Will you travel to see your family? 
<0> No i am single
<0> I don't study law, I'm in college to be a chemist.
<1> It is not hard to learn. You can do it. 
<1> No it's an ugly place.
<0> lol . that is a great start .
<0> I don't watch a lot of them either, but think the original is great. Only disappointing thing is that many of the "new" episodes advertised in 2014 really weren't new. They were just from older, or the British version. 
<1> The last time I read Jellyfish Princess, I cried.
<1> I hate running.  I would never do that.
<0> I was bashing chevy for being hard on gas. I'm more of a Dodge guy myself
<0> I never move. I still live beside my childhood sweetheart.
<1> oh i know . i always feel judged and never know what to do .
<1> LOL nice. That would be a good time to drink.
<0> Some said i could seek spiritual help from pastors like Michael Pitts. 
<0> That's cool. I love horse riding.
<0> That’s great. It’s so hot here today, I can’t cool down at all.
<1> That sounds super boring. Why do you enjoy that?
<0> I would never want a pack of aplaca.  I hear they spit.  Gross!
<0> Totally agree! I love fly fishing and I do it every summer.
<0> Daily you do exercise you body not to weak. It is good for health.
<0> Yeah hopefully it will get me a good job.
<1> Aquariums really don't relax me.  It makes me nervous watching the big fish chasing the small ones who have few places to hide...just like in my pond...the big fish trying to catch the minnows.
<0> I make homebrew beer. I've got a thing for making beer. Would love to open a microbrewery if I could.
<1> Really! please just ignore her. she must be a naughty girl at that
<0> It never fails if you wait to the last minute something will go wrong.
<0> someone almost hit me with a car
<0> I don't, honestly they did a job of raising me and its their turn to sit back and relax. 
<0> I think I could try listening to that, not sure though. 
<0> seattle is the place to launch a music career for sure
<0> I would never get a tattoo, I think they look stupid.
<1> Then why did you do it?
<0> I live in S. Florida so I go to our local street painting festivals. So many touristy things here.
<1> It doesn't really matter where you work though, it's irrelevant.
<0> So am I, they are some very tasty traditions lol! Which hispanic foods do you like?
<0> I'm hoping to not have to spend anything at all.
<1> no i've not , i've never gone out of california
<0> that sounds like a good idea actually
<0> I may be,  but I think my roomie is pretty cool.
<0> wow that is so cool how did you manage hat
<1> Oh! wow that's good, Mustang wasn't as a hardtop and wasn't convertible
<1> You seem to know quite a bit about all these gardening stuff. Is it your passion? 
<0> my parents never taught me how to live off the land like yourself . i wish i could be as close to the earth as you are .
<0> Really you watched it that young? I never watched it as a kid i wasnt allowed
<1> well nice i am in medical school
<0> ive never been there
<1> Im loving this white wine i baught its so yummy.
<0> Oakland, California? Me too! What a small world.
<1> You are pretty ignorant to yourself aren't you?
<0> He might be that. I might be one of his friends in low places too.
<0> Yeah but one of the benefits could be a reduced total infrastructure cost.
<0> Oh ok. I'd love to learn the guitar but it's so much more difficult than a keyboard.
<0> actually i do not like to read comic books and plays.
<0> I think I've been working at the hospital for 13 years, now. How time flies!
<0> Oh, I thought you said you have seen videos about it.
<1> Nice, I like to crochet too, it's relaxing.  Does your grandmother require full time care:
<0> He was not happy,  I offered to buy him another pizza but he declined.
<1> Sweltering? I've had to wear a jacket outside yesterday on my way to work. It's freezing!
<0> yea im not sure i can afford a yacht though being as i just lost 20 bucks on this scratch off, and i'm usually quite lucky with these.
<0> Why would you want to be a teacher, that is literally the least admirable trade possible.
<0> Oh! I have no idea. I have always been farmer all my life.
<0> I hate all Chinese restaurants.
<0> Snakes as pets for me is a big no
<1> I live on a farm and take care of many animals. :)
<0> I am not interested in Guitar, as the piano is my main focus currently.
<0> Thanks.  Too many people whine about how their life sucks and do nothing to change it. I'm not gonna be that guy
<0> The taco is a traditional Mexican dish so I am pretty sure it started in Mexico
<1> Getting married as a lesbian is not awesome.
<1> I'm sure it isn't.  I wish I had a dog to play with.  They seem like so much fun.
<0> is this professionally or just a hobby ?
<1> I'm sure there are a lot of cameras to show you're good!
<1> I prefer to follow a recipe and its quantities so as not to fail.
<0> Oh yeah,  definitely. I was yearning for those days.
<1> Oh very cool! 
<0> Yeah, I wish she could have been a full sibling which is a first degree relative.
<1> Yeah, I hate my job
<1> Billy Connolly (nicknamed 
<1> Oh I can't stand running! I listen to music at home
<0> felt extremely stupid because i had no idea who they were. 
<0> It was nothing too bad.  A man helped me get it started so I could at least get it home.
<1> Thinking about it now, that was a terrible thing you did
<1> Not really, I don't like being alone all the time.
<0> I've never been a fan of hers.
<1> I will go the Theme park with my family. 
<1> I would not try to make a planter box for my mom when I was little.
<0> The who? I've never heard of that team before.
<0> Thats interesting to know.   She also sleeps most of the day, maybe I should get her some catnip.
<0> I love batman, I have the collection of all batman movies released.
<0> you should try out for another one !
<1> I bet it is. I've never been to Rome and Italy, so I can't say.
<1> Fun!  You can't really hurt youself though, right?
<1> business is good, i was awarded employee of the month by the owner of the bar last week
<0> I do. They all live very far away though. I don't see them much. 
<1> You won't get picked next time, and you DIDN'T get picked this time. 
<0> They are very brital
<1> yeah, iam addicted to the television shows.
<0> do not know what revelry is ? ? ?
<0> Surprisingly yes,  cant believe I did it. I left everything behind and only brought what I could fit inside my car. 
<0> Yes,  I was always taking care of him and making sure he had what he needed.
<1> Sorry. I'm having a bad day and I'm not willing to talk. See you later.
<0> We were good students that would never cheat.
<1> what is an immigration detention
<1> Whatever you do, don't buy a convertible. They are the worst. 
<0> so you do not like sports . i am a ravens fan . it is my hometown team .
<1> yes , but every one who looks at me wonders why am like that .
<0> Yeah,  I just have to remember that I can do just fine on my own though.
<0> I don't have any grandchildren
<1> Yes, I am watching basketball playoffs on TV today.
<1> me too ! except they're called kids
<0> The cost of a salon these days is ridiculous.  I want something bright and colorful. But it will have to wait. 
<1> Neither am I. Rats aren't as gross as people think.
<0> Nah, I'n not a huge fan of steak.
<0> Well it was a few days ago. I'd still be late.
<0> I hate basketball. I prefer watching baseball.
<0> Yes,  it did. I felt so nostalgic because I remembered those wonderful days, 
<0> You might also want to know that  the dealer is also dealt two cards which include one up (exposed) and one down (hidden).
<0> oh , michigan . that is awesome
<1> I've never owned a passport... 
<1> my family is fine.
<0> Being a stay at home mom is an important job too. 
<1> I don't know, I've never visited Michigan.
<0> I could use a stable hobby, so far it is just casinos and hanging out with my buddies.
<0> Sure, its not favorite kind of music at all to listen.
<0> I got proposed a kiss at a party but I said no.
<1> I'd hate studying to be a doctor.
<0> i'm ! i just auditioned for a new cooking show there . what are you doing here ?
<0> Oh okay! I got them mixed up. Hemingway, the American novelist and short story writer. It the book long? 
<1> Going to church alone is not good enough.
<0> I did well,  not perfect but good enough
<0> No I don't like music , i like to watch News Channel , They are pretty much reliable.
<0> When something terrible happens to a friend or loved one, it can be situations, the following list may help you find a better response
<0> She is 2! I was happy to get this accomplished before she turned 3. My friends son is 3 and still isn't trained.
<0> My dog can barely handle walking down the street without giving up. Dallas is nice, but I haven't lived here long enough.
<0> But they are young we need to threat them as other young kids. I will be giving mine a break of relaxation. 
<0> Well I'm okay, I'm lucky they didn't steel my bag.
<0> He got the promotion I had my eye on.

<0> Oh okay as I have never been to Disneyland before
<0> Yeah,  I'm definitely excited for it
<0> The flags are props with prop rifles used by the color guard
<1> Don't be so arrogant. Anyone can make their own business these days even children.
<0> Maybe once in two months. The body produces vitamin C itself, so I don't bother that much 
<0> you're right! I guess I am just very cautious you know.
<1> Yes I love the fact that there are always enough costumed entertainers
<1> I did and I wouldn't wish it on anyone, it sucks. 
<1> That sounds fun! I'm thinking about getting a dog one day, but currently I don't have enough time to have any pets.
<0> ll ! i'm in good company i guess , lets put you to the test !
<0> I am from Kentucky. So we get all the seasons. It can be 90 degrees one day and 50 the next. 
<1> oh , a scary show ? i hate that stuff . i'd rather watch a sunset .
<1> This movie came out when I was a senior in high school.
<0> that is cool . i like to take rides in semis .

<0> yea that would be cool
<0> i do not like kid
<0> oh that sounds good.my whole family loved the raisin roll and cherry cola flavor lollipops. 
<0> It is not a name. Alsatian  is what they call the breed in Britain and Ireland.
<1> Well, it's good that the teacher listened to you and considered your story. 
<0> Okay, hit me with the coolest theme you've ever seen for a sleeve tattoo.
<1> my dog , max . he loves hanging his head out of my old ford truck window .
<0> I'm unsure of that information. However I can tell you they have 6  petal-like tepals surmounted by a cup-shaped corona.
<1> This is true! Although I can't eat it as much these days as it packs on a lot of the ol' LBs
<0> I find ergonomics to be such a boring topic, do you?
<0> I have no favorite band yet. 
<0> I wish I had kids to read Green Eggs and Ham to. I don't have kids. 
<0> No thanks, I hate cinnamon!
<1> Doesn't sound fun, just messy...
<0> A dollar,  but it was nice cause I'm not supposed to accept them unless they say its a gift.
<0> Haha sounds safe Mickey and Minnie are not harmful!
<0> If I had children, I might watch that.
<0> you need to trust the almighty , he will always protect you .
<1> Oh that sounds like fun! Maybe next weekend you can come see my jewelry. I make earrings, and many bracelets.
<0> Oh he will be very protective of your child for sure. They become very close to children.
<0> blue is my favorite , it is so calming like the ocean
<0> I'm an avid reader myself so I can relate to improving reading hours.
<0> No, I don't suffer from asthma so there hasn't been a need to go to the hospital.
<1> Your family is not interesting.
<1> I am impressed with your determination. I am also very sorry for your loss, how long has he been gone? 
<0> really ! cool . what are their names ?
<0> Training to be a doctor. So student at the moment. 
<0> I have to drive all the time for work actually. 
<0> Wow same here I love BBQ and eat smoked food.

<0> I'll have to read some of his work to see if I like any of it.
<1> each year i go to disney world
<0> He is 4.  He seemed a bit young but my wife said give it a go and he did it.
<0> a freaking bird squaking about that sounded like a baby kitten in distress.
<1> i don't like ice cream
<1> I'm not a librarian, I'm a custodial agent!
<0> i'm not stressed i just want to look fabulous forever lol
<1> I really love the heavy old school musics which gives me joy
<0> I don't have much time to watch any tv.

<1> I actually love pineapple on pizza!
<1> Yeah its more sexist as I am a girl and you may try to do a flirt with me.
<1> I hate drawing.

<0> Nice country. I hear most people there are skinny there like me.
<0> Yep. On the other hand, I hate making tacos, they require way to much effort for the food to be worth it. I don't like making them at all.

<0> i am so sorry . my husband is seriously i will . you have my sympathy .
<1> Exactly. That's why I don't eat chickens... it's ok to eat chicken eggs though as long as the chickens are cage-free.
<0> That sounds like a solid plan. Once executed, you don't need to continue learning which is a waste of time.
<1> I live close to the beach but I never actually go to it anymore
<1> I haven't ever heard of it either. 
<0> I think I will,  I hope I can succeed 
<0> Yeah I really enjoyed reading it. 
<0> i like to do that also , or watch baseball .
<0> You're right, but I just never think of those when I think steak lol. Do you have a preferred cooking method?

<0> yea thats why i would want to do it
<1> I don't really care about other people.
<1> Your right, I think it would probably be best to  just forget about the whole thing.
<1> I am pretty sure she will understand. 
<0> That may be a form of child neglect, where it is a deficit in meeting a child's basic needs, including the failure to provide adequate health care, supervision, clothing, nutrition, and emotional/social needs.

<0> Oh no!, I hate R.E.M. and wouldn't waste my money on seeing them.
<0> it's true, plus being critical pushes us to be constantly improving 
<1> I don't know. I'm not really into Maroon 5 and I don't like their singer either. Maroon 5 is over hyped, overproduced pop music.

<0> I went to college and got my teaching degree. Got to love the summers off and all.
<1> I don't like lemon desserts that much, but that sounds actually good to be honest.

<1> You could,  but it's always a gamble!
<1> I love him, great artist.
<1> My wife is completely of a different mind.
<0> Yeah it is! I recently just drove from Texas to here, which was a 36hour long drive! But let me tell you, it was a beautiful drive!

<1> I rent a room from my parents and live in their garage. 
<0> they are nice until you have to clean up their mess.  it stinks. but they are nice to look at when they are going after their food.
<1> Your birthday is coming up, so why not plan something exciting as a treat for yourself?
<0> I am finishing up a home I am remodeling this week.  Then it's off to the beach.

<0> i also like the freddy movies but they used to give me nightmares
<0> That's fair, some of it can be pretty gross like something like steak and kidney pie. 
<1> To be honest its ok if they couldn't talk to you, they might have been in an emergency that did not let them talk to you. Also it was not a smart move to go to their place, you should have just gave them some more time.
<1> I never go biking; I hate the outdoors.
<0> Yeah,  I'm not looking forward to going down it. I'll just try to carve out as much meaningful time with her as I can. I feel selfish sometimes though because there are times when I don't want to be around her because it depresses me how she's changed. I need to get over it.
<1> What Army Bootcamp were you at?
<1> I'd rather stay home and read a book.

<0> My favorite sport is basketball.
<0> Me too. I don't care about sports.
<1> I understand, you can only do as much as your schedule allows.

<1> There have even been several spinoff series from Top Chef, including Top Chef Masters.
<1> I don't have a dogs, I only have two cats and a fish. 
<1> I'm sorry to hear that. Being single can be really valuable, as well. We need to fall in love with ourselves before we can be good for anyone else.
<0> Hey maybe I can stop by your workplace then and I can order your best dish! Sounds delicious! 
<0> Oh! Pretty interesting, I haven't heard of Reyleleigh, but I'm assuming he must've done a lot of research on the sky.
<0> No, I've never been. I like the comics who use props or magic tricks to enhance their acts. 
<1> I am thinking you could probably google it and see somewhere local.
<1> I wish I could, but I'm too afraid of heights to try it.
<1> I would get one of those electronic devices that will help you find your keys.
<1> I can't stand Jason Statham.

<1> I'm not sure, I've never had more money to know what to do with it haha!
<1> I don't mind Bruno Mars, but I hate his songs.
<1> I wish I had the opportunity to do it. 
<1> Things will never fall into place, It is always difficult
<1> It's better to walk away violence makes it worse. The bigger man is the one that walks a way.
<0> if you find a way to do that , you will be the richest kid in the universe !
<1> I do, while I'm in the waiting room i listen to my country music CD collection.
<1> Ha Ha. Just try to do better next time.
<0> I've always wanted to live in Cali. No, what is the tallest wave ever surfed?
<0> I did! I met my old friends and drank wine all night. It was a nice surprise. 
<1> The American team is my favorite as well.
<0> I don't know if I will be able to switch shifts though.  I might have to remain an extreme night owl for a little while until I can find new work.  Keep plugging through until just before dawn.
<1> These days I am in Seattle for my office work 
<0> I should,  maybe I'll go down to the local pub,  I need to get some fresh air!

<0> I will definitely check it out! It's bad that they don't tell you these things, that can really help with keeping dogs healthy
<0> I know,  I always get freaked out when I go to the beach!
<0> In the United States they call it a museum, but the British people use the word "gallery" more often.
<0> Around 9pm.
<1> That sounds best thing to do. Tell him to spend more time with his mother, that may help.

<0> i do . i have one named leeroy jenkins . like leeroyyyy jenkinssssss
<1> No I haven't 
<1> i know right...the world runs on money 
<0> But I find it disappointing to pay for the insurance above all the taxes deductions.
<0> I've read that women have 3 "color receptors" and men only have 2 maybe thats why
<1> I can't imagine the pain of losing a family member.
<0> wow that's great what kind of food
<0> Just the two. Still leaves plenty of time for my hobbies. Where have you traveled recently?
<0> I don't think its too far!
<1> ideally i want to work for an energy company working on new energy and fuel sources
<1> That moment must have been boring and sad.
<0> i don't think xbox is nearly as good as the playstation, the figures of xbox are not good in this comparison.
<0> Yes,  if you ever get the chance it is a great weekend getaway for foodies.
<0> No way my parents will ever do that. I am currently working 2 jobs to pay for the house I bought.
<0> Right! Well, my husband and I just bought a camper and we're headed south, so I have no excuse not to exercise!
<1> great memories of all the sports games i have been too , including baseball

<0> I love Starbucks I have it almost everyday.
<1> oh . i like classic rock . what about you ?
<0> Yes, they are healthy takeaway foods.
<0> I feel my stress has completely disappeared with the idea of getting a cat. I am going to eat a big pizza to celebrate!
<1> Hm.. judging from your conditions,  maybe McDonald's isn't the best place for your to eat anyway! 
<1> No, I am pretty short and I can never make a basket.
<0> I don't work so I have time to walk dogs.
<0> I've never been 
<0> That's a good idea,  I will do that first thing tomorrow morning.

<0> that sounds nice you should
<0> I hate animals, they are a pain in the ass.

<1> I am not sure a doctor will help.
<0> Yeah I agree that Sals is better. 
<1> I miss getting seafood. I love it, everything but shrimp.
<0> It's white.  I am sure I can put it together.
<0> Of course not i hate strawberry cheese cake
<1> Yes I have tried different seafood, but I only like regular fish not shellfish.
<1> I don't have much interest in the deep meaning of colors.
<1> That is so annoying.  Have you reported him,  or asked him to be sure to close the mailbox?
<1> I disagree. Enya is boring and puts me to sleep. Her music is annoying.
<0> Yeah,  I don't know if it's just my specific college's requirement or what.. I can see it being useful in my major since I'll have to interact with people in my profession,  and some of them could be foreign. It's still nerve-wracking.
<0> I am Vegan!
<0> I was really inspired from seeing it.
<1> Me neither - can't stop drinking them
<0> It's crazy that the United States has the highest obesity rate in the world.  I think it is really starting to affect us now though; impacting insurance and hospitalization costs.
<0> Yea, I really like school. It is relaxing for me. 
<0> What a time to be alive!
<1> i won the beauty pageant before but really did not think it was worth it
<1> I like the fact that you can make steaks out of a variety of meats such as fish, ground meat, pork, and more.
<0> ginger and violet . they are picky eaters . is your dog picky ?
<1> Oh I hate cleaning, doesn't really matter if your space is a mess if you can use it.
<0> Yes, you might need help.
<1> Wow! That's the same age as my youngest child.
<1> I have 20/20 vision and don't need glasses.
<0> I did it by just sending my parents a message, it made it easier to bite the bullet
<1> Oh no. I'm sorry to hear that.
<0> i did not like foot ball movies
<0> I wish I'd learnt piano! too big to carry around though, the guitar was easier for that when I was learning
<1> Yeah. I love it when i visit UK
<0> Oh I can already see the chaos that could be! I would want to call out on that day!
<0> Ya, my uncle thinks the same. He'd never get a motorcycle because of that.
<0> molasses , you say ? clever ! you sound like a good parent . i don't have kids yet .
<0> Animals hunted I would guess. The inventions of pottery for holding and boiling water expanded the way early humans cooked though. 
<0> I did not enjoyed that much
<0> I really do hope so.
<0> yes . i should be fluent by monday when i land .
<0> i use to work in retail , now i am dreaming to have my own restaurant

<1> No I haven't what is that?

<0> Everything he does is illegal.  He is a terrible president.
<1> Wow! My mom has fond memories.  Would love to take her on vacation there.
<0> I would give her a chance to explain. I don't want our friendship to end 
<0> Working in your pajamas sounds like the biggest fantasy! Maybe I can go into telemedicine and only dress up on top each day and wear pj pants.
<0> I'm thinking of joining a dancing class.
<0> No I am too busy working as the janitor at the local grocery store to play anything.
<0> No I would hate that
<1> No, I don't. It won't be easy having a pet in a city as big as this
<1> It's this reality show that's kinda like American Idol. People sing and there's judges that rate them.
<1> We can meet at a football game, I love football so much!
<1> i like growing vegetables in a big yard . i love mostly r and b .
<1> I do not know if the cat is fixed but the owners are great neighbors and I like them but the water sprayer may not work
<0> That's interesting, actually. If it was a British colony, it probably has a lot of modern amenities and a good infrastructure. I feel a lot better about visiting there now!
<0> Dogs are cooler than cats, which I don't like.
<1> I going snowmobiling in Canada  for a week, Winter is my favorite season.
<0> Nope. Basically I yelled at kids for running and worked on my tan. lol

<1> I don't play soccer i am disabled and can't even run.
<0> LOL Definitely slippery me! New medication with fun side effects.

<0> Have you ever been to summer camp?
<0> Nah, let's talk about something else. I know enough to know I'm not at all interested.
<0> oh ok . i always heard that it was painful for them
<0> In sociobiology, "polygamy" is used in a broad sense.
<1> Well there's sleep inversion, it's when you absolutely cannot sleep unless its daytime and vice versa.
<0> no pets . do you guys have many parks in texas ?
<0> My uncle had a Harley, I remember.  My aunt made him get rid of it.
<0> Yeah, I do like regular coke though. But I can't afford it except for once in a while. I drink mostly water and coffee. And milk sometimes.
<0> i know , i'm going to try
<0> Neither have I.
<1> Well, it's good that she nags you, you have the opportunity to get out of the relationship
<0> I do sales work! Not the best but pays the bills! 
<1> yes its very peaceful and soothing
<1> I just put the winter tires on and I'll be driving in snow in a few weeks! Where do people want to travel the most to?
<1> I'm not too interested in guitars.
<0> personally , i work as a paramedic . it is difficult but definitely rewarding .
<1> They serve fish which I don't consider Italian cuisine.
<0> I work in a coffee shop. I don't work at a candy shop
<0> that is awesome ! the startup i work for is actually located in san jose
<1> You could have taken another form of transportation, this wasnt really an emergency or excuse for you to be late
<0> Its not a kind of thing where I can go walk into their office or anything,  but I did message them and show them the part that I did,  so hopefully that will change their mind! At least towards me anyway!
<1> Oh sure i eagerly wait for yours son's birthday, 
<0> Walmart! They are so worth it! I just had two and now i'm full! Remember to get the coconut white chocolate flavour!
<0> Yeah but I hate concerts so I'm not too worried. 
<0> I Sleep great! I usually sleep almost hours a night and up just before sunrise.
<0> Never been to one myself maybe I should try one.
<1> I scare easily
<1> Actually i don't care what happens to street dogs.
<0> I hope so!  Gotta get my parents to take the kids and I was thinking of making his favorite dinner myself.
<0> There is only a book about it, no movie.
<0> I tried the Pumpkin Spice in the past, but I didn't like it.
<1> I hope the other team beats you.
<1> Your job has to be really boring, I bet.  I work at a zoo. 
<0> Yeah, it's really all about convenience to a location. There are less Target locations near me as opposed to Walmart.
<1> Not to me. I find them ugly. 
<0> everyone left me behind
<0> It's something brand new,  and it works very fast.
<0> That would be kind of creepy
<0> Zoombieland Double Tap. Me and my husband are big fans of the first movie. So funny.
<0> The newest pokemon game "Let's Go Pickachu" A bit nerdy I know but I love the series. 
<1> No, I don't think going to church makes people very happy.
<1> I hate to watch boring Netflix shows.
<0> Much better,  and I knew she would take good care of him
<0> Good thing no one really liked him anyway and everyone seemed okay.
<0> 1971? That's a long time to be in the coffee business.
<0> I wouldn't know. I never really read because most books are boring.
<0> I think Italians do since they were the first one to make one.
<1> hahaha. sounds nice.  do you guys get together like once a week or what? play any local venues?
<1> No complaints. What is your favorite kind of food?
<0> I don't have much time to do hobbies with my 2 geckos!
<0> yeah , i run in every morning
<0> I think acting is a waste of time personally.
<0> Normally lots of vegetables, like spinach and broccoli. They help provide energy and building material for my body.
<0> No but it sounds delicious!
<0> I know there's nothing worse. Have you ever gone through anything similar?
<0> I hate summer. It's just too hot.
<1> Thanks. I have so much energy right now. I think I am going to go for a run. 
<0> Yes,  we play bridge together/
<0> My parents are both actors. 
<0> Yeah, lets go to the mall! I totally need to get a new purse!
<0> I have never heard of them! I know a lot of indian food is vegetarian!
<0> Cool. I've been enjoying growing sunflowers too.
<0> She is. Perfect driving record and very reliable. I'm not worried about it.
<0> I've always wanted to write a novel about vampires.
<0> Darn, I can't then, I am from India.
<1> Seems pretty easy like you don't need any talent to do it, if you ask me.
<0> I'm a student 
<1> Honestly.. I see no chance they aren't. They have their Nike brand, and then Nike Golf, Nike Pro, Nike+, Nike Blazers, Air Force 1, Nike Dunk, Air Max, Foamposite, Nike Skateboarding, and last but not least, Air Jordan. All those lines and brands, making that many billions a year... Too strong.
<0> you are right! it brings bad fortune
<0> I just had my bedroom re-painted. I went for green as it's my favourite colour.
<1> How close was it? 
<1> I would but, coke is my least favorite soda!
<0> Oh, it's no problem for me. I just hope that my wife doesn't put on her Rolling Stones album. I hate their music!
<1> I don't think having a couple of drinks and driving home is bad.
<1> It's a bummer when an event is a bust
<0> Exactly. I wouldn't even date someone short like him!
<0> I did see the Ohio state band in person last year they were ok. Nebraska's marching band was awesome. 
<1> That is a fun themed contest! I wish we had something like that that I could ride my bike to.
<0> Me too, I’ve never tried the guitar.
<1> yes we are trying to
<0> Yeah,  I'm so hungry usually and I'll get hangry when this happens
<1> You'll have to train them to walk on a lead! I just wish we could have gotten into yosemite lodge - I hated having to setup our tents at the camp site.
<1> No, I don't think that is really that important.
<0> It is,  I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.
<1> Thats what I would have done. Did they get it taken care of?
<1> I sew all my blankets and give them away at Christmas.
<0> i don't care too much for pizza.
<0> I can't wait to go to the clubs!
<1> I like to listen to country and rap, i cannot stand rock or pop
<0> Yes I am. Many things could go wrong I hope they don't or I probably won't be getting a raise and worse still I will be to embarrassed to ask for it.
<0> I only like to eat things that are healthy.
<0> no ,,,,  am not a blackjack dealer
<1> You should not worry about it if nobody knows about it no harm no foul
<0> its not a profession , just a hobby . lol .
<0> Nice! I would love to see them play live some time. I bet it's a blast!
<0> I really enjoy watching it. None of the teams are very good though. 
<0> oh, sorry about that, been loyal to your job doesn't make you a happy man. and that is the reason why  i am not loyal my family.
<0> Yeah the US has the best views and wildlife , I have always wanted to try Canada but never managed to actually to leave the US.

<1> I am sure they will have a great time
<0> American football is what I am excited for.
<1> I agree. Only young people should skate board.
<0> antiquing is boring and i'd never be caught dead in an antique shop
<1> Yea my father retired form the Navy and he loved it.
<0> I just rely on the fact that he will not take any chances and will look out for me if I am in trouble.
<0> He is always talking to other girls. 
<1> It was good outcome of payoff.
<1> Well just be careful, you wouldn't want to hurt anyone's feelings.
<1> lunched with the witchy sister in law , then had my hair done .
<1> i'm good thank you , how are you
<1> That is a good idea a free lancer like me can live anywhere who has no responsibility or family commitments. 
<0> I don't think he will,  he isn't too wild of a person. But I hope he has fun!
<0> I don't know what I would do, but since the machine were the issue, maybe they needed to be replaced.
<0> I hate my siblings. They bitch about me all the time.
<0> Yes. There is a 10 percent chance I could die.
<0> i am trying to become a baseball announcer . do you like baseball ?

<0> yes I really don't like reptiles, I wish she had a cat instead
<1> I do not like your parents at all, so if they were robbed I would laugh.

<0> oh that's a yummy jpb
<0> My doctor told me I have type 1 diabetes. I'm afraid of the complications that may occur down the line. What should I watch out for?
<1> What about Java? Is it related too?
<1> Yeah it is why i prefer Private really as they are able to choose what to teach and they work better

<0> Dogs and cats most often! I take pretty pictures for the ones at the shelter to help them get adopted. 
<0> I dont like summer at all

<0> Nice. If I knew how to skateboard, it would probably be one of the top hobbies for me.
<0> I'm pretty basic although I do use the soup mix - Turkish cuisine uses vegetables.
<0> Yeah my grandfather lived across the street from one,  we would go almost everyday when I was there.
<1> yep if it deserves to be yelled at thats one thing

<0> i am not a big sports fan . i am pretty nerdy .
<0> I don't really like sandcastles
<1> Oh I love them both.  Luckily they offer it both frozen or fresh, as well as in portions or the whole thing!

<0> Sometimes, I like all the seasons, but mostly warm.

<1> yeah, I thanked him too because I really like him touch my burrito
<0> I would never make my dog  run an obstacle course. It is do dangerous.
<1> Well, do you have a brand that works the best?
<1> That wasn't the right thing to do - you should have admitted it to her.

<0> No, my hair is black.
<0> That's good then. I always forget that my parents are people with lives. They've always been superheroes. My dad deploying was kind of a wakeup call.
<1> Many cultures don't associate with mustaches, so there's very few tips on growing it out. 
<0> Hm, I see. Anything else you could tell me about it that I could tell my friends to sound like I know what I'm talking about?
<1> that is some type of combo
<0> Bengali food (from Bangladesh) is actually known for its fiery flavors, so I think you'd feel right at home. I'm the same way, love me some spice!

<0> Yes, professors at universities may teach business, accounting, or other fields.
<0> I lost my wife a year ago in October. I hate this time of year. It reminds me of her.

<0> It was! I was so happy. I thought I would lose him forever.
<1> Man that's insane, it's like a foreign horror movie. How are you feeling now, still uneasy?
<1> Yeah, I'm going out to dinner with her tomorrow, she taught me things like that.
<1> That's so boring to find out what's inside.
<0> Well the name was couched, The English name is derived from Old English "Tiwesdæg" and Middle English "Tewesday," meaning "Tīw's Day", the day of Tiw or Týr, the god of single combat, victory 
<0> The film was directed my Michael Mann who is also so accomplished as a director.
<1> i have already cable 
<0> Yeah. I have an xbox too,  but I slightly prefer ps more.

<1> Its dangerous, especially in the worst country on earth, America.
<0> I already took steaks for dinner some hours ago.

<0> Luckily,  they didn't take anything. It made me so mad!
<1> I dont like the old school stuff, jsut new tech for me thanks. 
<0> Yes, I Agree alot often I have to wish I paid more attention to instruction of math rather than giving up and getting fustrated 
<0> Never heard of the Tewa people, so while that's a little interesting, it doesn't do as much for me. Can you leave me with one really interesting fact about it that could help me?
<1> You should be really concerned that they won't like you.

<0> i have a stratocaster, a Mexican stratocaster, i like to one day buy a USA strat
<0> My kids hate them.
<1> no its more of a hobby
<1> That sounds very interesting.
<0> I wonder why. Ice hockey isn't that popular in Canada.
<1> I just paint to create things. Its like Expressive Therapy to me, where the process of creation is emphasized rather then the final product
<1> personally i really like tofu. it's one of my favorite foods.
<1> I am trying to be an Accountant as I love numbers.
<1> I don't work in robotics. I am a marine biologist. I study animals.
<0> Me too, I wish I could be alone all of the time. 
<1> Where is that located?
<1> Oh, I guess I should have known advertisements were the source of revenue.  What special features are offered for a paid account?
<1> Yeah, me too.  I wouldn't have yelled either.
<1> It might be good that you don't have more time though, since it's better to work and make money. 
<0> music . i love all kinds of music .
<0> I love to cook. I used to do it as a profession but that took the fun out of it.

<1> Maybe, but I'm not the biggest fan of hikes. Too much walking and I get sore easily.
<0> sounds fun , i spent most of my day cooking
<0> I haven't called and asked yet,  I have a lot of steps I need to complete for successful enrollment. Some of the steps seem to require mailed-in information rather than electronically sent.
<1> I am a gymnast and I can do multiple cartwheels in a row
<0> There's a lot of rock climbing where I live, I also enjoy doing some climbing every now and then. Where are you located>
<0> Yes its amazing and i wouldn't trade it for the world. You meet a lot of great people. 
<0> Next weekend actually. There are a couple of really good writers entering it,  too.
<1> That's too bad. Their beaches are almost as nice as the DR's beaches.
<0> I really hate working on cars.
<0> That sounds nice. I don't get out much, myself.
<1> i would but farming just seems so unnatural to me, i could never bring myself to practice it.
<0> Moles should definitely get checked regularly by a dermatologist, just to be sure. Freckles on the other hand just produce more melanin in the sun and get darker.
<1> Your brother handled everything as peacefully as possible. His reaction showed restraint and patience. The cops will see that. 
<1> I'm not sure it can be classed as significant, it's only one disease. I don't think I want out kids to do better than us to be honest.
<1> My cousin and I are actually working on a website too! It's a project for our high school newspaper. 
<1> I have lots of different kinds of lizards. Bearded dragons are my favorite.
<0> women should be the one
<0> I never met my grandmother, she died before I was born.
<0> I know all of the weight lifting competitions.
<0> That is great! How about next week? I have nothing important going on next week. 
<0> Yeah, working at Chuck E Cheese was a lot of fun.
<0> Yes,  I try not to scratch a lot and I put rubbing alcohol on the bumps.
<0> None. Sushi is too weird for me its raw fish!
<1> No, it's the worst place. I hate living here!
<0> i don't run as i can barely see anything . so no trophies .
<0> me too! but i cant find no one
<1> I'm a fan of algebra based maths, just not geometry 
<1> Actually it was America that  imported more African slaves than any other country.
<0> Yea. She walked to the nearest gas station.

<0> No I don't know what Harvey is.
<0>  younger years was my dad but high school, a tutor
<0> the biblesgood . lots of wisdom . i just do not like people taking it literally
<1> Sounds boring, I would rather do group activities and go to parties.
<1> I also train Olympic Weightlifting 
<0> Glycerine by Bush. It made me feel odd,  like I was in the past. 
<1> No  this is not  bad  that  she can not  take  care of  her kids  . she will  learn  it  slowly  . 
<1> i liem that and spending time with the family
<0> What kind of dog?
<0> yeah sometimes it makes life difficult. my back is always very stiff
<0> I was shocked because  they offered a promotion. It sounded like something was wrong
<1> I just shave it this  morning.
<0> Oh, those are my favorite flower too!
<1> I've never seen lop eared bunnies before. They must be quite the sight
<1> I wouldn't say so. I like being at home with my family. There's no place I wanna go other than my home.
<1> Sounds like we are a lot alike! What's your favorite drink to make?
<1> Do do it so much its normal. actually they ask questions you don't expect. 
<0> You will love Tennessee! I go to visit my mother there, at least once a year.
<1> Me too. I buy the premade dough and frosting though because I don't like looking up recipes and making my own. 
<1> I hate cats but love dogs
<0> Yes, she is our first
<0> Yes thats a great feeling when that happens :D Slot machines are also informally called fruit machine (British English)
<0> That makes sense, the last museum I went to was very expensive.
<0> i agree that too...........but now the people are better than our grand old peoples
<1> the woods and there is an archery center near my house .
<1> yeah i enjoy some chocolate every now and then . whats your favorite food to eat ?
<1> A five star hotel always has roaches and you should never stay in one.
<0> It's probably been used in different ways throughout history but today it is processed and sold as dry flakes. It's then dissolved and used as a sealant. You can even find it in many foods today.
<1> Sorry.  That is where it all originated, historically.  It is now grown in several other regions of the globe. It first spread out of Africa in the 15th and 16th century, initially to the Middle East and then to the Balkans, Italy and the rest of Europe
<0> i don't play video games
<1>  i love to cook and usually improvise,the beer needs to be dark and any 2 cheeses you like
<0> I couldn't tell you what a latte is, except that I know it's made with coffee, and I don't drink coffee.
<0> The test was positive! I was so happy!
<0> yeah i also really do not like unicycle
<1> Florida is the same as California
<0> i actually don't like pizzas
<0> Yeah I was really ticked off but luckily the car wash said I can get another wash for free. That made me feel better.
<1> I listen to a lot of Stephen King books. He's probably my favorite author.
<1> I dont' draw that often but when I do I like to draw people.
<0> Okay. But I love when people are close together in an office space
<0> I don't know about the police report.
<0> It is like and infection in the brain.  It came on pretty sudden though.
<0> Most certainly. I may even be considered an omnivore considering it seems quite difficult to cite a ratio between facultative carnivore and an omnivore. I would find it impossible to live off only meat or only veggies.
<1> i am pretty sure he does but you have to be sober to hear
<1> Sounds bland and boring to me
<0> Yup, and sometimes, if we were really feeling lazy, we would just grab some field rations since they're easily prepared and eaten.
<0> I don't think I've been to a doctor in years.
<0> What about movies? Do you have a favorite?
<0> Oh - no, remember, I've never tried it.  Sounds gross.  I like potato chips
<0> I'm just really disappointed that they announced Ridley for super smash bros. 
<1> Tool!? No Abby hates tool
<0> No I dislike being vegan, It puts on too much weight in people, the only thing that makes it worthwhile is not having to eat cheese! Yuck!
<1> yes but i live with my parents..
<1> I wouldn't know, I've never been to New York.
<0> I do care, I'm happy you're getting a new car!
<0> There are lots of varieties of roses and I hate red coloured one.
<0> I got for long holidays with my friends. Fortunately I don’t have any pets that need looking after.
<0> I think you might hate her designs 
<1> That's quite a line up! I don't think I've heard of Young Thug. What are some of their songs?
<1> Good, I'm glad that job din't work out for you.
<0> Me too!
<0> no but i was so mad
<0> That sounds painful!  What do you do with all of your free time now?
<1> Interestingly, when the Europeans started colonizing, things remain unchanged.
<1> Me too. I much prefer to stay inside and read a good book

<0> Not sure if other countries use it in the military, but it is taught in Hungary and Czechoslovakia.
<1> What went wrong with the pizza you were trying to make?
<0> I don't like expensive things.  I'm more about just getting my needs met.  That's why I've only started working last year at 25!
<0> What's your favorite bait?  Mine is Zote pink soap and/or dollar store meat.

<1> last night i even dreamed i was surfing and a giant blockchain pulled me under .
<0> Like what? 
<1> Well, don't listen to it, it's nonsense. It isn't normal and you never learn to live with it.

<0> You are probably right. I always had a feeling that she would cheat on me, and I was right. But with another woman? I would never have guessed she'd leave me for a woman!
<0> He scared me. He said that he willl break my leg if I don't pay him back.

<1> I think so you have enjoyed this vacation a lot.
<0> its great exercise and good for the mind too
<0> Well it has a special place in my heart. The only thing I do not like about living here is the rising rent costs.
<0> Maybe I will! The friend I was walking with was wearing a silver necklace, so maybe that helped?
<0> Definitely. I've been traveling for over 45 minutes to the nearest one.
<0> nice. how hard is that? I've never tried that. but it sounds nice
<1> Yes you should try meditation to keep your energy levels up and focus. It helps me

<0> 10 years.She just got a very big promotion at work.She is so intelligent and dinamic
<0> The four key elements are MCing/rapping, break dancing, graffiti writing and DJing with turntables. I think hip hop more encompasses the whole subculture instead of just the music.

<0> one hundred years or a little more than that isn't that long at all.
<0> thank you so much
<0> my brother works for best buy , they have suspense novels there .

<1> ya great to hear that you got info about the person
<1> I do have a cat and my parents are happy I got one.
<0> Yes, in some areas the apartments are owned.  Now those owners may lease them out as well, and so then they would be rented.  In our area, you just rent apartments and yes it would be a cheaper option.
<0> Nightclubs usually do not have a dress code either.
<1> We do not have a mall where I live
<0> Nowhere, I do not like to go on vacations. I have no plans to go on vacation in future. 
<1> Okay, I am going to go pick up some fast food now. 
<0> I would have bought a red SUV. Red is my favorite color!
<0>  In my area there is an app that lets you order everything you need and all you have to do is park, they load it into the trunk
<1> Every since I could drive. I still have my first, a 79 Camaro.
<0> Snorkel is such a boring activity

<1> Yea! Now I just need to find someone to watch my cats when i go.

<1> I'm thinking about doing that when I retire since I'm always so full of energy!
<1> I don't know anything about mexican cuisine though.
<0> what do you help your mom ?
<0> I'm simply not a fan of creamy dressings. I will get a light Italian or a Vinaigrette if I'm eating a traditional tossed salad. Most folks love Ranch.

<1> You're right. I would never move there.
<1> i hope so. i'm so bad at math. they count 5,6,7,8! at the beginning, and i wish they would stick to smaller numbers
<0> I love my job. I make great money with regular raises
<0> I won't have time for my child.

<1> I haven't, I don't care for the Halloween movie series at all. I have never seen one.
<0> i don't believe recycling will give a positive impact on our world

<1> i am going into marketing . people like you with money to spend are my bread and butter .
<0> Yes please, I am lonely and single
<1> Well thanks but I never go anywhere - I'm strictly a homebody.

<1> i wished that they did . . do you have any favorite movies ?
<0> my step dad did the same to his employees . ignoring me .
<0> I would hate that.  I'm not into classical music. 
<0> I totally agree! Dogs can be a bit much, and not nearly as good in a stir fry IMO. They are quite loving though!
<0> Well a pure vegan diet consists of absolutely no meat, and no animal products either. That means, no eggs and no dairy. Some vegans still eat eggs and dairy, just because it's too tough to cut those out.
<1> I never owned any Nintendo products. I rarely played Nintendo also, I always liked Sega and Sony more.
<0> Yes, I love the Food Network. So many amazing chefs out there.

<0> It was just so dirty inside. Like he never cleaned it at all.
<0> Yeah she was fine. I made sure to apologize several times after. 
<1> Your going to hate it. Depressed people like it there!

<0> No but my mother dose. Dose your daughter still dance? Ballet has been around since the 15th and 16th centuries so it's very common to know people who have danced.

<0> I work as an accountant at a big firm. I just moved to this country for work three years ago, so I'm still getting to know the city, make friends, and learn the language.
<0> Yes it's good, it has been almost 10 years since my brother and I are workng together and we didn't want to go to college

<1> no,i am afraid of laser eye surgery also i do not wear glasses
<1> living in the city is so loud
<1> me too, the last movie was really bad
<1> I think it's easiest when you do it as a way to flirt in order to see how interested they are.
<1> It's a game with dominos. 
<0> No, not at all. I couldn't stand the first one so there is no way i'll be watching the second one at all.

<1> Hopefully you can make up for that jerk move. 
<0> thankfully, my pets don't live with me 
<1> you should just be loving and patient. I'm sure he didn't mean it.
<0> Yes it is alright but there are other models that easily beat it.

<0> recovery for humans usually is in 7-10 days although some symptoms may last up to 3 weeks.
<0> Of course, i meant he was born in 1942, sorry for the typo.  In 1961, he enlisted in the army as a paratrooper, but that did not last long.
<0> Yea enough to have it get fixed. I was so mad. I had a big meeting at work that I had to miss.
<1> Yes, because I live alone.
<1> Yikes! I relaxed at home all day. I didn't even go anywhere.
<1> People come and go.  You should free yourself.
<0> I will do. I'm so tired from my gym session earlier.
<1> Well as long as they love it
<1> Did you call the police?
<0> huh i guess that makes sense.
<0> You've gotta be able to laugh at yourself when that happens though, and you're right, at least it helps you learn
<0> i hate winter as i will get sick often during the winter
<0> I don't know, based on what he texted me he seemed truly upset. 
<1> The game is fantastic, except for the graphics.

<1> Probes have been sent to Mars beginning in the late 19th century.
<1> well , i'm sorta typical . incarcerated father , impulse issues . any other hobbies ?
<0> It's okay, I do too! I knew they were referred to as ray finned fish.
<1> You are really a terrible person.  
<0> It was on BBC Iplayer. It was quite upsetting.
<1> I don't. I only listen to music created this century.
<1> That's nice that you can share things like that,  it seems like your family is very close!
<1> It was all a bad idea to let you have the box. Bad memories
<1> That's why all the jockey's I see at the horse races are so toned!
<0> I don't blame her, she really wanted the enhancement.
<1> I always like exploring food trucks by where I live, especially the taco trucks.
<0> I don't think you really know much about raising kids
<0> Just my car got damaged badly. I was so upset,  but luckily there was surveillance video at the nearby gas station.

<0> Well they're a brewing company so they make beer. An interesting thing about them is until October 11, 2016 they were a joint venture with MillerCoors.
<0> You could say that, but I'd be crazy not to take something if I was certain I wouldn't get caught.
<1> Yea, because 3 toes on my left foot literally.
<1> I am a good father I have three kids
<0> Going down to the casinos. Trying to make as much spare cash that I can.

<1> I don't think Uber can enter the self-driving car market
<1> What do you mean j, it starts with the letter M.
<0> Yes but I do eat meat.  I find that going vegetarian I eat too many carbs.
<1> Texas is awful. There are hurricanes often.

<0> Do you know what kinds of divorce their are?
<0> yea i am pretty sure they're junna take it all the way this year
<1> What? No. I'm an accountant. I don't have time for frivolous things like that.
<0> Life long friend in deed. I recently watched a real life movie of all the characters look so much like the originals from the cartoons we grew up with 
<0> I only buy junk food. I think healthy food is overrated. 
<1> I don't live in California
<0> you should eat kale it is ethically superior to meat
<1> Yeah but it's sad I don't even remember anything from my childhood. Its boring for me
<0> Sushi originated in Southeast Asia but today has spread across most of the world.
<1> that is sweet . you do not have to deal with a 20 years older husband
<1> You must be miserable being in a relationship that long.  
<0> As long as you eat a balanced diet and lots of fruits and veggies, it is healthy.
<1> That doesn't sound like a job you'd be qualified for
<0> you do what you got to do in life i suppose .
<1> No, i run 3 times a week so I think I'm ready
<1> It's a good thing you guys aren't talking, I wish I could do that with my sister.
<1> I wish I had time to read, but working as an EMT doesn't give me any opportunity.
<0>  i know she's a little older 
<1> I think you should drop the whole issue altogether.
<0> sounds like a fun career
<0> I guess i have to use one, after i graduate next year.
<0> I've always wanted a horse. It's too bad we live in town though and only have a dog.
<1> Oh no! Dragons scare me, i hope they're not real. I never want to see one.
<0> Right?! It is the worst. Especially if you are not anywhere near home and your friend takes a while to get to you.
<0> Not really, people don't fish around here
<1> Last night saw a movie. It was good
<0> oh that's beautiful ! i just listen to pink floyd .
<1> It's on NBC. I wish I could watch it whenever it's on but I'm so busy. 
<0> My stupid teammates all left the game. I was doing really well but couldn't win by myself.
<0> We really enjoy Chuck E Cheese. My kids love their pizza and games.
<0> Hmm. OK. I don't really read much, I prefer movies.
<1> I've never watched "The Voice". Not really my type of show.
<0> I am from New York and I like Statue of Liberty most.
<0> Yeah, it sucks. I wish that I had a family. 
<0> I will!  The Lizard's name is Lizzie, and she's a  . . . what did they call it?  Oh yeah, a Komodo Dragon!
<1> Same as yours.  I wouldn't switch to anyone else because I think their customer service is stellar!
<1> No, I only work one or two days a week from 5pm to 9pm.
<1> No, I have never owned any pets before.
<1> You and the Nile Crocodile, the 2nd largest reptile in the World.
<0> Yeah, but I would prefer she writes romance novels and not fantasy ones.
<0> I set a target of getting my first victory royale on fortnite and achieved it. Now I have 18.
<1> i've been in for 5 years now and i've seen the world .
<1> That does sound bad
<1> I'm not scared of heights. I love to be high up!!
<1> Me neither. I always dream about staying home in my bed.
<1> Wow, I hope I never have to experience anything like that. Luckily I've always been pretty happy throughout my life.
<1> That's great. I have one boy. He is a handful.
<0> Actually many are able to be adopted without payment! There is just the registration papers, you seem like you would be a good owner.
<1> I like spending time with my parents playing golf.
<0> I hope to win a trophy one day.
<1> I seem not to like all the parts of the movie though.
<0> it seemed like it would be but something kept telling me that I should wait before I make any decisions because I really am not sure if that is what I want.
<0> do you read anything else
<0> i like football , i was a kicker in college .
<1> Nancy doesn't care anyways and go tell her you ate the cookies
<1> anything look for it in the listing
<1> Going boating down the river seems kind of boring though. You should do something different 
<0> I did not follow through my lessons
<0> I am very sorry about that  - my dog is elderly and I dread her passing. 
<0> Yes, I do enjoy a screwdriver every now and again. How's your morning been going so far?
<1> Oh, I know nothing about biofuels.
<0> I had to call animal control
<0> Nope, thjat is why book burnings are so insane, that is knowledge and effort being wasted for no reason. Reading is a privelege, it should not be disrespected
<0> I like baked food, but like grilling food better
<0> Soccer is my favorite
<0> hmm , sounds pretty cool . but not as cool as my pink hiking boots !
<0> Snowboarding popularity in the US is said to have peaked in 2007 based on equipment sales. Ever since then it's on a decline based on sales.
<1> I'm sorry, I can't feature sports gambling on our broadcast.
<0> Well,  I haven't practiced enough and I need to refine my notes I think
<1> My dad is allergic, or he says he is. 
<0> Sounds like fun - I enjoy roleplaying games. The program's still going strong then in popularity?
<1> I don't really think it's your choice to make. they'll probably send out whoever they can. you'd get better value if you just did it yourself.
<0> We had a great time at lunch so I don't need to make up anything.
<1> I don't care about the kinds of magic tricks he performed. 
<0> I've been trying way to hard to satisfy everyone. I think I'm content with being single,  for now.
<0> I don't make short films about strangers.
<0> that sounds very exciting , you can ride bikes , listen to music there too
<0> I wish I would have had a sibling to grow up with me. I missed that strong emotional bond.
<0> They’re the reason I’m good at basketball they inspired me to work hard
<1> You'll love it, raising kids is so easy and fun.
<1> I hope I can go there some day.
<0> of course ! a dog and two cats . what about you ?
<0> Yes, I felt very fortunate to get a job that I wasn't really qualified for.
<1> I will just think they are happily watching down over us and try to go on one day at a time.
<1> Yes it does. I'm glad I saw the last one.
<1> thanks . what kind of things do you like to do
<1> My friend just moved to russia.
<1> Don't worry about it, those schools aren't even worth being nervous about.
<0> She is a go getter but things seems to come easily to her which I'm thankful for.  I'm having trouble keeping up!
<1> Yeah working out all the time would make me crazy, it can't be that good for you.
<1> Actually yes and it tastes great. I prefer to get it without lettuce since I don't like the texture but it tastes wonderful regardless.
<0> Who knows why it took them so long to make that book into a movie.
<0> yes, thanks. Are you living in a joint family or separate ?
<0> I think this other place carries it,  but they're pretty far.
<0> She has,  and her sister is a violinist too.
<0> When you have access to a service like that you are always grateful for it.
<0> I wasn't scared; just went and made breakfast.
<1> Oh, none. I hate reading.
<1> I think it was all messed up that day. 
<0> That is odd, Will he act movies?
<0> Yes, I could see why it would be boring.
<0> I guess everything in life is about balance. What would you recommend, supplements or natural options?
<0> very interesting fact, I wonder when this became popular?
<0> Mostly live bait. Occasionally use lures if fishing in a lake.
<0> Kind of, the map is made by other players but it is not much of an adventure and more like setting up a base and raiding people.
<0> It's 11.99 per year depending on if you renew your tuition (buy another album). The school released in 2003
<0> Indeed there was. It was hosted by Gordon Ramsey, a famous British chef who doesn't mince words when he is criticizing contestants!
<1> That's a great idea I've had many dogs that I love, and it would be nice for my dog to have a companion
<0> Yes for sure, the only thing I do not like is sometimes they can get a little pricey but usually the convenience is worth it!
<0> Even though it's not the largest country geographically, it's home to 127 million people. It's the tenth most populated country in the world!
<1> Roast beef is fine but I hate BBQ steak.
<0> i want to try drugs , but i don't know where to buy them , do you ?
<1> That's Bad.
<1> probably but surprisingly those regulations aren't that strict .
<1> You should be ashamed of yourself.
<1> what do you do for a career ? do you work in an area you enjoy ?
<0> Thanks! Its good to actually get some money out of it.  We play folk music with a rock twist.  Its great music.
<0> good
<0> Nothing on the agenda for now. This is his first pageant. 
<0> nice ! computers and technology fascinate me . what would you like to do with them ?
<0> I like to read, play golf and listen to classic radio programs. But perhaps I should start to learn how to build computers!
<0> Endorsement is done by American Psychological Association (APA)  and require that applied psychologists be trained as both researchers and practitioners
<1> Neither Do I, they are dangerous and I do not like Justin Bieber.
<1> do you like to drink freshly made organic juices ?
<0> really. I dont like food too much
<0> I've been a vegan for a couple of decades and while it is hard at first, it soon becomes second nature. 
<1> yea.its a definition giving by psychologist 
<0> Hm that does seem reasonable, I definitely get worried whenever my stomach is bothering me.
<1> it is , and is it cold out there , i heard yall get a lot of snow
<1> Very nice. I've never been to Virginia.
<0> I wouldn't know, it's never occurred to me.
<0> The documentary is good, but it’s not so fantastic
<0> Yes. One of my favorites. I didn't think I'd like it at first but now I'm hooked.
<0> Did Last of the Mohicans win any awards
<1> Steamboat sounds like a place I need to visit.  I've never heard of Aspen so I can't really compare the two.
<0> Yeah,  memories are sometimes all we have
<0> no , i have no family . do you ?
<0> Not really, its been around for so many centuries that its hard to track the activity of fishing
<0> I don't sew. I have always wanted to learn though.
<1> I'd like to drink on the weekend but my work at the manufacturing plant always keeps me busy.
<0> Oh no, I have never been married
<1> pasta is always delicious , i love driving in the rain
<0> I stood up to realize no one was around to witness my fall.
<0> No I actually never took the time to read it.
<0> The snack I hate the most is Cheetoes
<0> Interesting. I've had my eye on a green Honda Accord for sale at my dealership. Anything remarkable about that model you might be able to tell me about?
<0> Yeah I feel the same way,  then it ends up being nothing serious usually anyway.
<0> The cake was just really good. I felt pretty bad afterwards.
<1> Yikes, that's a lot! I hope my husband never loses his ID card!
<1> Ah ok,  yeah my partner has had similar issues recently. I really hope it all works out for you!
<1> Yeah, expensive and can be useless sometimes
<0> Oh yeah? I am waiting for my first pair of glasses to come in the mail. 
<1> I was never thinking that at all.
<0> I prefer football to basketball.
<0> mine is omar , where do you work ?
<0> All cultures like the same amount of spice in their food.

<1> very nice . i love play rock music . my favorite are the rolling stones
<1> Yeah, we were so excited when he came home.
<1> No, Pecan pie is my favorite dessert.
<1> Yeah, my 7 handicap does help I guess.
<0> my brother left the gate open and my dog got out,  needless to say my brother got beatdown.
<1> No surprise there, I consider you a bad candidate!
<0> The most popular model is the F-150 which is now in its 13th generation!
<1> Well, that's probably because I love breweries and try to visit as many as I can.
<1> Well I don't habe any
<0> i don't go my home in future
<0> I think it has a lot of benefits
<0> I'm glad it did. Otherwise, I may have never gotten to taste my favorite thing: pineapple pizza. 
<0> True. Brady's got too many haters cuz he's been gold since day 1
<1> And can be bad for infections too. Then I love how they scare the rats away.
<1> I'm not worried about going there. I think the place is pretty safe.
<1> I dislike music of any kind. It all just sounds like noise to me. I dislike it almost as much as I hate reading!
<1> You should not be. Drink all the caffeine you want it's harmless
<1> Too bad,  is you window broken now?
<0> That sounds like fun, I wish I grew up with a dog.
<0> Yes, those are some cheap cars.
<1> I'm not a show person. I'm just a traveler

<1> I am so glad I saw the movie I enjoyed it. 
<1> kudos ! as a firefighter , i should run more but school took most of my time .
<1> Cool, I don't know any french. Mostly I read classics, I just finished Dracula.
<1> I really enjoy Tacos, it's my favourite Mexican dsh.
<0> It is, though I was very close to paying them off myself so it won't make that much of an impact. 
<0> Yes and different ones around the world like Argentine helado and Italian gelato
<0> How much has the teen pregnancy rate increased over the years?
<0> yes they are better than the honda accord I have now
<0> oh , i work in a radio station , they use my voice
<0> Well I hope you don't find any bugs in the cars.
<1> Are you a horse racing fan?  Maybe a little more your thing
<1> I am 32, how about you?
<0> It was chocolate and candy from my Aunt
<0> I agree I imagine Amazon has made a fortune selling Kindles, I know I have bought a dozen or so as gifts over the years
<0> Yeah it is, it's pretty cool if you can multitask, you need to roll papers while being focused on driving, it can be challenge.
<1> Yeah,  I was so excited because I'm 12 and will be going to middle school next year.
<0> No one in my family has ever been to a chick fil a!
<1> Just calm down. It's no big deal if a paycheck is a little late.
<1> Damm. So you really dont care huh.
<0> Gross i can't stand exotic animals i much prefer something like dogs
<1> Yes, and we got to wear really cool uniforms that were our school colors
<0> Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. Glad to know you had a good support system. Do you have brothers or sisters?
<0> What does a Shiba look like ? Are they good with kids, i take it they are if you grew up with one ?
<1> Good to hear! You really need to exercise it hard to build strength. 
<1> Oh that is so sad. I hope you find him!
<1> You'll have to stop by my house, then, I live on the East Coast.
<1> No, I'm single, but I'm happy. I actually don't envy anyone who's in a committed relationship. I've never been jealous of another couple ever! 
<0> But They are the same, the emotion has not difference
<1> i watch baseball all the time, so i do too.
<1> ugh , that's terrible . sounds fun though .
<0> Yes I passed with flying colors.  But that feeling made it that much easier.
<1> Yeah, I definitely need to get everyone's holiday list going as well. 
<0> whats your favorite color ? mine is blue .
<1> I'm so happy for you and your son.
<0> Thank you. I guess I learned it in church, but I wish I had gotten baptized.
<0> Oh, that's good. I live in Italy and it is impossible to find good hamburgers here.
<1> I am going to plant hemp for the majority of my farm land.
<1> As I said, I have never been to a zoo at all. 
<1> I get that. Roller coasters are terrifying.
<0> I love to go to a lot of parties.
<0> i dont think i will, i dont want to get bit lol
<1> Ok, I didn't ask though.
<0> i like to read and travel. does your work have you traveling often?
<1> Sorry that you have to go to the haunted house alone. That must have been scary. Where were your friends?
<0> My ex husband also loves to golf - ugh
<0> Thankfully I'm not interested in playing the guitar. I always wanted to play the cello.
<0> You’re probably right. It’s just an easy job with friendly people.
<0> I would assume they are attracted to the ship itself as while it is in space, it is collecting micro dust particles. In the particles, there might be life. 
<0> This sounds like it will be quite the challenge for me. Anything else I should know before I dive in?
<0> 26. Good to keep healthy! Recently I like buying phone accessories and electronics  
<0> How about the last century? I bet it was more than 33%.
<0> i named him rory . . . . i like doctor who .
<1> I wish I could see it, unfortunately I am currently between jobs and broke
<0> it may be! They do tend to notice flashy things. I have three dogs.
<0> fall is cool . i've 30 pairs of boots i rotate through in the cooler months . .
<1> Will be honest, breast cancer is very treatable. I'm not sure why your'e so stressed.
<0> Yes I am! It was a long and tough road,  but it's finally over!
<0> I spoke up and was very angry.
<1> When I borrow something and it breaks I don't feel responsible. Usually that just means it was close to breaking anyway. 
<0> headsets because they're louder
<0> Yeah it pretty much is. The flute is known though, it dates back some 67,000  years!
<1> Thanks, how old are your kids?
<1> I like Cheetos
<0> Since I'm unemployed, I mainly take my dog to the park since it's free.
<1> Yeah, just listen to the music and try to enjoy it.
<1> I'm very much the same, my wife's ill, I hardly see her but I keep working to support her and the kids, their comfort makes me feel good
<0> The baby is due in January.
<0> They aren't a client of ours. Apple is though.
<0> That sounds interesting. I work full time as a cashier.
<1> I think if I went to Rome I could squeeze in everything I would want to do in about a week.
<0> Well the Chinese did not know more than the Greeks or anyone else about "paper". As a group the Chinese were hardly idealist. If it was not for that 1 very intelligent man Cai Lun and his novelty, then the Mediterranean European civilizations would had invented the whole thing.
<1> Oh, I really appreciate religion much more in general when it incorporates nature and an appreciation for nature. I'm glad you've made me think about it a different way.
<0> KK BUT I LOVE SWIMMING
<1> wow ... u are very behavior.  tough job.  i work in IT
<0> I had to clean it up,  but not before I yelled at her and showed her what she did.
<0> Maybe. Thankfully I have never been in an accident.
<0> I HATE FARMING AND I DON'T TO FARMING
<1> I can't even count. I go hunting all the time, even now. I absolutely love hunting.
<0> I guess so, but I think vets are overrated and expensive. I don't really have much respect for them.
<1> What is your favorite music? Mine is classic rock.
<0> nice ! i'd be gigging too !
<0> The company got its start in St. Louis Missouri but their headquarters are in Belgium
<1> I'm sure you'll never see those tools again.
<1> whel its not an accident she is a real mess i feel shame for her and for you too
<0> your teeth look okay
<1> He probably doesn't think you need it.
<0> Yeah, that is good stuff. We have a few good local spots here, but none like when I lived in CA. 
<0> Well, I don't even like comedy all that much, not like I would watch any live.
<0> What grade are you in, little dude?
<1> I did, but it was too cold visiting during December.
<0> Me too, what a bore. I would hat a warm, sandy beach. I personally don't like Australia.
<0> I am definitely tuning in for that! I wonder if they'll be doing a lot of tricks or what.
<0> Not really since I can barely hear them through the thick walls.
<0> No! But,  I felt envious of him.
<0> Pregnancy comes with headaches and body aches
<0> Very. This one in particular has a few loops and I hate being upside down
<0> okay , come feed me some and let me try them .
<1> i bet its tough . we get patients like that every day .
<1> Hmm, you are probably in a time zone behind me then.
<0> Maybe after I plan my wedding.

<0> god bless you and your big extended furfamily !
<0> yeah i've been hanging out with a girl from work . she's cute
<1> i am a chill guy, it's fine.
<0> I did the same thing when I finished school 2 years ago. It didn't help me get ahead at all. 
<0> All of em LOL.. I have been saving up for weeks!  I need back to school clothes
<1> that is so interesting, I wonder if they caught the guy
<0> its always a challenge for me to make the same meal twice the same way. I like to experiment.
<0> not even skilled,  i'm just cheap lol I didn't want to spend 500$ on something i could fix for 160$
<0> i've a black subaru sedan . i love that car .
<1> I know. That's why I spent the day with my friends playing Frisbee at a BBQ.
<1> Me too. I've been spending every dollar I get on clothes.
<0> It's a very laid back and you don't have to have much training.
<0> I remember learning about the Victorian era in class a few years ago, but I can't really remember that much...just that woman wanted more independence. So crazy that novels like To Kill a Mockingbird were written afterwards
<1> Why would I do that? It's not like it has any harmful effect.
<1> Yes, they're definitely not worth fixing.  
<1> Not a big fan myself, don't find it very funny
<1> Yeah I don't want to look like one of those rock and roll dudes.  I can't stand rock and roll.
<0> Radiation is is not very bad.
<0> i am a computer nerd . . . i love programming and developed facebook some .
<0> Yea, I suppose. I usually read books on my hikes when I need a break.
<1> do you have any brothers or sisters in ny ?
<0> You can't let your kids play much because that'll only make them want to play more. It's an endless nightmare!
<1> what are their names ? i only use my bicycle .
<0> I wouldn't, I've never had hydroxyl alcohol in my life either
<1> I know! I love spending my free time outside.
<0> thank you . what is your favorite color ? mine is red .
<0> that's awesome . i can teach you piano one day , could be fun !
<0> I never know what to get him so I hope he likes the shirt I picked out.
<1> I have never ice skated before, I am much more into track and field.
<1> Metallica, I like Lars Ulrich, their drummer. Drum is the only instrument I ever played, so he's my idol. 
<0> I work in sales. I'm a great closer. 
<0> Really? I prefer romance movies, good action is bored.
<1> Languages, that's why I'm in Malaysia right now to learn the language. 
<0> I would never want to go there though, New York City is one of the worst cities in the US.
<1> Maybe I could visit you when I'm done driving the cab!
<0> I wasnt hurt. Nobody laughed but I still cant believe I didnt that.
<0> I only know of 2 people that have completed the whole trail and it took them about a month.
<0> Yes, I have had that famous savory chocolate sauce called mole that they use in tacos. The mole sauce is made with like 50 different spices including chocolate. It is so delicious!
<0> I'm glad to hear that. Flooing happens everywhere, I think I will take my chances while around palm trees.
<1> No, he actually had a hard time with it and failed.
<1> Oh, really?  I don't read too much outside of my comic book collection.
<1> I don't think she'll get past that.
<1> kids ? no , no kids . cats . . . 3 cats . you ?
<0> I like the beach, but I don't think I would like living there. No privacy.
<0> I hate cookies.
<0> There isn't much inspiration in a place like Siberia, as the weather is horrible most of the time, and my job at the dollar store leaves me no time for painting anyways.
<0> It is so tough but the most we can do is let them know we love them,  and will be there for them. Thanks! 
<0> I remember playing hockey back in high school which was really fun.
<1> I hope you get away with it.
<0> Gross, why would I want to go to Paris? 
<0> I saw the ad for that, it looked pretty interesting. What's it about?
<0> Never. I'm allergic to most seafood.
<0> have you seen the conjuring ?
<0> Oh really haven't seen it
<1> violet is beautiful. it's such a lovely color, unlike blue.
<1> i feel i'm a strong female because i can carry a heavy backpack .
<0> I know,  make sure to cherish the people you have in your life!
<0> I just met him yesterday.  That's why I was unsure whether I could trust him.
<1> I would never soak in a hot tub. I actually never sit down in large bodies of water. I only take showers. I have a phobia of soaking in water. I don't even go swimming.
<1> Birthdays are terrible, I don't acknowledge them. 
<1> hahaha, absolutely. what's you favorite food to eat?
<0> I don't like BBQ either so its good that i live in such a big, contemporary city.
<1> Yes, I exercise every day with my many friends. I have lost so much weight since.
<0> It's a jack russell!
<1> Yeah, but its not flexible, and you have to be in front of the computer all long, I hate my job.
<0> my mom and sister . we go to at least 2 shows per year .
<0> i sometimes race away from my three exes in them . haha
<1> Have you ever camped in the national parks?
<1> ho its really interesting. i would like to go with it shortly
<1> Yes I know. It's not easy to be a great parent. And I think you need more time
<1> Does online shopping make it easier?  I would think maybe it would relieve some stress if you could do it from your house
<0> Yeah they can keep their elongated serpent selves out of my house.
<1> You probably won't be. A degree in business is a horrible degree.
<1> yes , southern california right on the median border. Do you like to read books about cars?
<1> She deserves that money.
<1> In that case don't you get bored just eating beans? Any tasty recipes for vegans?
<1> I don't really like cake that much, so no, but I'd like a good pie
<0> It is not from Italy.  It originates from Greece
<0> oh , what is your hobbies ?
<1> my dog has never pooped anywhere indoors. she's an absolute angel.
<0> I still watch the episodes online now.
<1> that is not awesome.
<0> i only play the air guitar drums but i don't like the instruments to play.
<1> I think I'll go to Madagascar. I had some bad times in Asia.
<0> Try having eight children like I do, it can be so rough and I really regret it. 
<1> I wonder when was the last time they came out with a new album..
<1> I hate Batman especially the series where Christian bale was portrayed as Batman. I really hated him as a batman
<0> Yes! First child! It's given me new inspiration for my writing too which is good!
<0> they were ok.i had no information at first
<1> I don't understand why anyone would be that way.
<0> That’s good
<1> and with my epilepsy . where is my bible ?
<0> I work for a marketing firm, nothing too exciting. 
<0>  i do accept ,  even then i believe in miracles!!
<1> I am not very social so I do not like meeting new people I stay to myself.
<0> They don't use sugar or thick sauces. It's just a unique and delicious set of flavors.
<0> thats not a problem reduce your weight and join swimming 
<0> cool ! i really love rpgs , larps , cosplay , etc . i love the costuming .
<0> I like my job so much.
<1> yes in garde 12 for the second time
<1> You might not succeed at the new job, but that is okay. 
<0> I bet you can find a lot in Florida. That's funny you said pool boys are your jam. I can't stand them! 
<1> Quilting sounds like a terrible hobby.
<1> I am unemployed.
<1> I don't like the show! 
<1> My dad is a mechanic.
<0> I do have a will made,  thankfully. And mainly it's just career stuff. Which can be pretty stressful
<1> it does, it just sets normally
<0> yes i am see sharks in one time
<0> Nice, what have you seen lately?
<1> Math? I don't like any kind of math. Never been a numbers person.
<1> Thats awesome , im saving to move my family back to our home town in mexico.
<1> But the Backstreet Boys are easily memorable and unmistakable.
<0> I want to be rich and tall like Lebron.
<0> well i like to play video games .
<1> Sorry about the situation. I wish I could give you more advice but I've never been in your position before.
<1> How are you going to celebrate?
<0> Thats great. What do you partents think about that.
<1> I love gardening in my free time, sometimes I also pick up cooking.
<1> Sounds like it! Are you in a management position or something where you can say something to them?
<1> You should not stay quiet, ask your boss for the reason. Otherwise leave that job, search another.
<0> Sounds like a plan to me!
<0> I don't have Job so I'm Searching  , i have many friend for referring job  
<1> No, I don't really care for bagels. They're too hard and difficult to slice. I've been spending all my time making sourdough. 
<0> my wife named our dog , doggie md . she's a nurse , she thinks that is funny .
<0> That is some of the best furniture to have for sure. The upholstery styles were amazing back then!
<0> I feel there is no need raising fund for the hurricane damage, it wasn't that bad
<0> I do ballet, haha that sort of counts, right?
<0> I see, but I don't miss having a pet.
<1> It isn't, I'm still catching up on some work
<1> People were available to walk you but you declined.
<1> Really?  I also love that.
<1> yes , what do you do ?
<1> i am in college , so that keeps me pretty busy
<0> I don't have a job and I have been searching for one.
<0> I agree.  Another thing I like to do that is relaxing, is hiking. 
<0> I hate the work of interior designing, it's tedious.
<0> I did and they fixed him up
<1> trail bike or street?
<0> Well,  the entrance looked like it was added on to but the football stadium was the exact same.
<0> He learned two new tricks today. I was able to teach him to give me a highfive and roll over! he is the cutest pup! :) 
<1> The beautiful sounds come from the five strings that are stretched across the length of it.
<0> Never heard of that instrument. I guess their shells protect them, but can't stand up to vehicles.
<0> Eww I really can’t stand the color red for some reason.
<0> I just had pasta salad, and you?
<1> then which u made it.
<1> I already knew you didn't do that.
<0> Yep it can be tough as there are many intricacies of raising a child aside from an actual real biological relationship.
<0> Nickelback! They're pretty good I like them too. I'm really diggin The Story at the moment.
<0> I don't know - I didn't order anything but received a card o say they tried to deliver.
<1> I would imagine that people who have certain personality types are typically drawn to becoming doctors. They all seem to be very compassionate! 
<0> I don't have time to do Mturk or anything else on the computer - my full time job as a CEO keeps me too busy.
<0> That's good to hear, exercise is my thing, but I can't find a gym to go to in my area.
<0> Actually that is true. There is only one standard if you will for ballet. Anything else isn't really ballet.
<0> Yes I agree. Thank you.
<0> Not really, I have a rare condition that completely blots out my iris.
<0> my mom and dad are over 6 feet tall from drinking milk l . o . l .
<0> Yea it hasn't been easy but I am proud I haven't
<1> I don't travel for my job, they are to cheap to let us travel!
<1> have you tried playing games with them ? role playing can be fun !
<0> I love my job! 
<0> Me either.
<1> I'm studying engineering.
<1> Just think of it as training for an Olympic event because it was one of the original Olympic events in 1896.
<1> I live in a huge city here in Russia. It's called Moscow. Have you ever heard of it?
<0> I do not play games
<0> at my age i am in very good health
<1> its not funny 
<0> True, you do need to put a roof over your head. But you need a reason to smile every day too.
<1> Do you want to get one now?
<1> Yes,  that is a smart plan. Knowing that we cannot foresee the future,  it is a good idea to be prepared.
<1> It is really boring. I do not recommend that.
<0> Since they are domesticated they can't be that difficult. Ferrets have been outlawed in some parts of the world though due to how quickly they become Feral. For example hybrid, ferret polecats have been outlawed in New Zealand.
<1> am in class very early every day cause i love what i do
<1> You are right. Are you into any form of exercise?
<0> Ditto! If you want to keep chatting we can...I think. 
<0> Maybe. I hate coffee, gave up on it a long time ago.
<1> i wish you could find happiness another way . do you have any hobbies ?
<1> Actually there's alot of people still speaking it, I'd say maybe most people can
<0> get out ! me too ! i'm an ex lawyer . any specialties ?
<0> Oh I dont have a dog, I have a little tabby cat!
<0> Yea,  thats what I'm gonna get!
<0> I saw how animals were being treated and I just felt so bad for consuming meat.
<1> everyone feels like it
<1> I'd rather record a song than write a novel.
<0> Where did you go in Mexico? I hve never been there.
<1> Ah, yes. That can be nerve wracking. Hopefully you can find a good solution. 
<0> I didn't even take his glasses so I'm not sure why I'd confess to it. 
<0> My next door neighbor's dog is a pitbull.
<0> i am not sure if i can say . but i happen to be a college student , myself
<0> get over it.
<0> green is my absolute favorite color .
<1> You should probably stay out of that neighborhood in the future. Glad you're okay. Stay safe out there.
<0> i am afraid when he grows to be young man whats gonna happen.
<1> That is a great idea, I need to walk my dog.
<1> Yes I love his style. I'm a fan of his look as well not just the art ha ha
<0> I think maybe their lifestyle make them not to have space for others
<0> Yeah luckily my boss told me I could take a paid leave during those two pregnancies so I can take care of myself. 
<1> It won't but at least then you've gone through the mothions.
<0> No i actually don't trust them,they could be hostile sometimes.They are not friendly.
<0> It really is a peaceful life. But you know you have the mouse dilemma, if you live in Here you don't get killed or live in the city eating tasty.
<1> No, I don't want to see anyone. I'd rather stay alone so that I'm not too busy.
<0> Ha. I have to agree with that. I like to cook and crochet.
<0> oh, i don't love anything historical anyway.
<0> anything logical and rational , i will eat what do you like to eat ?
<1> yes we would until i eat all the cookies . . lol
<0> The hands often make the best tools 
<1> That's good.
<0> I guess he's very particular about his works, he's actually still writing the sixth novel, called The Winds of Winter.
<0> Yeah, I barely read though, it's boring. I read about 2 books every year.
<1> Yes, I am. I mostly play though, when our power goes out and my brother BBQ's which I love. It is the only time everyone is off of their devices
<0> Yea it was disgusting. I live with a roommate and he had forgotten to empty the fridge before leaving for his own vacation.
<0> Well I don't know when paper got started but I don't think it's been around all that long.
<0> At least they are less woody than they were before.
<0> Yea I have a husky that I like to run with 
<1> I perform with my trumpet at beach parties outside of school
<0> I don't have a garden. How about you?
<0> Im not sure. She was very old,  I had her so long. 
<0> When did you get the first piece if you don't mind?
<0> Pizza is better than sushi which I hate
<0> I do both, unless I can find someone to play tennis or volleyball with. It's much more fun to play a sport than just work out for me.
<0> Sounds like you have kayaked internationally, you must be  very adventurous. Ever kayak in America?
<1> Really?  That's very beautiful.
<0> Cool!  I saw someone with blue hair the other day.  Not sure what would possess someone to dye their hair blue!
<0> Me too... specially when I'm about to go on vacation
<0> someone elses door 
<1> You know there doesn't seem to be much you can do with coke.
<0> Me too. In Russia, they also have a team of people that are guardians for the tigers because there are only aout 500 Siberian tigers left there.  Its so admirable that they are protecting the tigers!
<0> I like to alter my clothes.
<0> Yeah, big yards are fun. My yard is really big too.
<0> Yes, I'm currently going for walks and eating healthier. 
<0> Sounds awful actually, which is probably while I will never move there.
<0> that's cool i don't it freaks me out
<0> I like staying in also.  I like to meditate whenever I get a chance.
<0> Yeah.  We would watch a lot of shows together.  My favorite was Family game night.  Have you ever sen it?
<1> You don't like trick and treat right?
<0> i secretly love kittens . despite the explosions and the military and the travel . . .
<0> Wonderful - I would love to volunteer sometime, I rarely have any free time to help anyone else
<1> College is so cheap these days. Why do people need scholarships?
<1> Make time for it, there is nothing more important than a romantic relationship.
<0> Jobs, that's the reason I'm not excited about graduation.
<1> Yeah they have made a few of them. I like them so much I named my cat mater after the tow truck in the film.
<0> The Atlantic ocean is beautiful! It's the second largest ocean in the world
<0> Depends on the time of day I bet. It was busy enough they seemed to be moving through. Was at another general buffet and the sushi was just sitting there getting hard. 
<0> Do you listen to it while you're farming?
<0> I am feeling mighty old at thus point, 1996... oh my. What else you know on my previous heart throb?
<1> I'm sure that helps. I've never had any type of anxiety so I have no need for pills. 
<1> that was probably us when we were little lol ,  my little nieces are the same way and they are such bad actors too
<0> Gee, the responsible for so much. A large number of games were centered around the Mario theme, across many years and different systems. By 1963 the company even tried other small businesses like opening a love hotel and a taxi service! 
<0> Maybe she could make a music video with them and make us all rich!
<0> Yes, on vacation, but I always think people are looking at me
<0> yeah i am
<0> Hello!  Also a great hit by Adele have you heard it?  She co-wrote the song with her producer Greg Kurstin.
<0> Yeah, kn the desert and the fantasy worlds I create for myself at times. Always day dreaming!
<1> I can agree with that.  What do you do to support yourself anyway?
<1> I dont let my kids eat snacks.
<0> I like kayaking in a river
<0> We are all pretty much in shock and very sad.  She is staying with us.
<0> Yes its True. I was aware that scuba diving was different than underwater diving.
<1> Ugh! I hate listening to music.   I'd rather read.
<0> No I'm not sure if he did or not.
<0> yeah , sometimes , love to go dancing , esp salsa !
<0> I was there last month for a week.

<0> Yeah, that is my favorite Harry Potter movie too! 
<1> I hate law schools, I am looking into becoming a chemical engineer. 
<1> I have so much energy now that I had time to rest over the weekend. The weekend felt like it went on for days.
<1> I don't think they are nervous about meeting you either.
<1> Agreed, that's a great attitude to have, we only fail if we don't try, right?
<0> acually they are from the desert in arizona
<0> It is! Great to be ready to roll. 
<0> I just did it because I wanted some candy,  but now I feel kinda bad about it.
<1> Yea, I work days at an ad agency as a photographer. 
<0> One heck of a imagination. The new stories are way better, than his older writings when he first started.
<1> I never lived in a small town so I don't know how you feel.
<1> Oh I can feel and still get water all over my clothes. 
<0> Chocolate sucks.
<1> cool what about got eh ?
<0> wow that would be crazy!
<0> No, nothing like that. They are just small house snakes
<0> I live in one of the warmest places on earth.
<1> Are you sure you wanna do it? It would better keep them away from sugar hype.
<0> The Strokes are playing this show on the fly in a month. It's so cool!
<0> Yes, if humans keep abusing wildlife and taking over their habitats, then the earth may be in trouble down the road. 
<0> In Zimbabwe, houseboats have been used since the creation of Lake Kariba in the late 50's/early 60's
<0> It really is.  The 'opposition' really hates me so she is trying to keep from them.
<1> Oh I don’t play online games.
<0> It will be for the Nintendo Switch!
<0> Yes and I will be leaving my baby with a neighbor that I feel will be good with her.
<1> Do you remember when you dad gave it to you? I bet it's a special memory
<0> Yeah i was ok but i think some people saw me
<1> Then you need something to motivate you. Try watching the Rocky II
<0> what does sahm . country mean ?
<0> I should probably do that. I sometime think that they are doing that in purpose.
<1> That's the reason I love cakes and cookies much more and not pizzas.
<0> Luckily she's fine,  but she has no memory of it. The Doctor suspects she might be losing her balance
<1> i like r b and pop , you
<1> I usually jog or lift weights. My least favorite workout is zumba.

<0> when you go on your cruise . . . remember to get seashells . . . love sea shells
<0> It was dark out so they could hardly see me
<1> Oh mine! I have experienced it a couple of times.
<1> What does that have to do with work?
<0> Headed to Mystic,  CT for his job. I am not at all excited about leaving my friends and family. I hope it won't be as bad as I feel that it will be.
<0> Yeah, they play soft rock all day long
<1> You should tell your girlfriend about your exes. Hopefully you aren't able to work it out so I can date her. 
<0> sometimes a little uncomfortable . what kind of music do you sing ?
<0> There are a variety of hues from dark burgundy to strawberry blond. 
<1> No sadly we did not dogs are so dumb, we did not even get past the try outs.
<0> Same thing happened to Madonna
<0> I don't think the boys need to memorize when and where the Boy Scouts started. They just enjoy camping. 
<1> wow , paranormal romance ! like twilight ? i love to read , but mostly non fiction
<1> Nothing really . I don't enjoy cooking.
<0> Season 2 Episode 3.
<0> She was better looking.  I am so ashamed.
<0> you'll get there ! do you have meat a lot ? i try to limit for health reasons !
<0> It is. I got really lucky.
<1> Maybe you shouldn't be working so much and head back to the weights. Health is important!
<1> Although I have not yet read anything about global warming,I deem to support you fully.
<1> i am a coach you see
<0> Yes, you got it right.
<1> I know it sucks when people get what you need and its out of sight but I hope you get one soon! 
<1> Why did you buy it then?
<1> I don't have a dog either. I just have a cat named Noah.
<1> Me either. I want to read the book  The Love and War. Last book I read was Old man and the sea.
<0> I work in an art store. 
<0> Well, I'm the only one in my family that wears sports clothing so just me.
<0> Exactly, I had no one to prepare breakfast for the first day of school
<1> oh wow . what do you do on your spacetime . i love to run .
<1> you should get a different job
<0> Its hard to find good fantasy themed TV shows now that Game of Thrones is over.
<0> Health care place. Except they're earning more than me in the same field,  even though I am way more qualified
<1> i was happy at that time :)
<0> I am curious as to whether or not you prefer farmed salmon as opposed to wild.
<0> I think you're right. Bach is the only piano player I think that is any good.
<0> Those all sound very good too. Do you ever order from common pizza chains like Dominos? I like to make my own pizza sometimes.
<0> I lost my welding job a few months ago.
<0> At that point it's almost better to just recycle it for spare parts and components.
<0> kids demand too much time
<1> Yeah, and my life is bad because I made it bad.
<1> Next ride which time u go
<0> wow, I should really try it out thanks man.

<0> For 10 years. I like it because it can also meet all recommendations for nutrients in every stage of life.
<1> i am pained.
<0> ya he has sold himself . good marketing
<0> That wouldn't work.  Cupcakes aren't good for birthday parties.
<1> You are a very small person and I'm afraid you would get hurt in a fight.
<0> Well,  it made me want to sink into the floor. I don't like being the center of attention
<1> i can not help , we are about to have a larger family .
<0> Yeah, he's my cousin.
<0> I need a dog sitter
<0> Me too! I have collected hundreds of astronomy and science stamps.

<0> It is sad.  I would like to be a part of the change with that
<0> Haha! yes, I wouldn't be able to help you with that, I have never done any form of fighting in my life.
<0> Da Vinci is one of most famous painters in the world for his iconic Mona Lisa and Last Supper.
<0> It was chocolate and she made it from scratch
<1> Have you ever owned one? I don't know why people would ride a bike with a dog.
<1> i actually hate it too
<0> Me too! The pizza we know today was created in Naples. It has become very popular around the world since then. Do you like New York style pizza?
<1> Sunscreen isn't that needed, you'll have fun without it.
<0> I don't read, only listen to jazz music.
<0> maybe you can help my son , he's about that age , and he hates me .
<0> I would love to try painting sometime.
<1> It's way too big now. It's lost a lot of it's charm. Where are you from?

<0> Don't worry I don't even wants to check out the local shops here.
<1> i love swimming
<0> Miami is such a cool place, I have always wanted to visit. Did you like anything else about Miami?
<1> Wow those both sound like interesting courses! I really like my degree so far, but I do find college to be very difficult sometimes.
<1> Have you tried to drink an energy drink and get ramped up, it might work.
<0> That's interesting.  In light of modern MMA fighting, does Karate remain a dominant art form?
<1> really sorry, i can't say i know how you feel because my parents are alive
<0> I don't have a gun! Or another person! Ah man... Guess I'll just sleep in the bathroom with the door locked

<0> No, unfortunately. And perennial sunflowers are usually not suggested for gardens.
<0> I enjoy going to church, fellowship around the Word, around the Lord. That is my pleasure.

<0>  I think there are also books that helps people become better parents.
<1> I only have one cat, so they dont have anyone to fight with
<0> I never really liked having pets.  It takes to much to care for one.
<0> I think dancing is pretty boring and pointless.
<0> Mad Men is just gorgeous to look at. You're in for quite a journey. Something else set in the time period (ish) is the The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel -- I'm really looking forward to the second season. She's have something to say about extreme couponing ;-)
<1> oh wow ! ! i work with my friends at a hospital

<1> Yeah.  I love it.
<0> My parents have sold their land that is around 1 acre cause I hate outdoor gardening.

<1> Yeah, I wouldn't tell my boss either.

<0> When it comes to people, I think I am more introverted that extroverted.
<1> Cool, when did you get it?
<0> aw so sweet ! where are you guys from ?
<1> I asked you if there were any fish, I know it was cold

<0> I don't know. I've never seen it.
<1> They are very patient with you then.
<0> I've never seen it, what's it about?
<0> I love wearing makeup even though I'm a guy.
<1> I don't think anyone enjoys going to the dentist.
<1> I don't think so. Can you sign a petition against PETA? They are too extreme for me.
<1> No. I spent my whole day at home today. So, I am planning to go for a night party with my friend.
<1> i really do not cook i have a chef that does that
<0> Correct, other sub genres include blues rock, folk rock, raga rock, and jazz-rock.

<0> haha , i am always early . especially for my music classes .
<0> Retrievers need lots of outdoor exercise, they tend to be fenced in by their owners because of their curiousity to roam
<0> No I did not,  we were not mandated to,  but there was a voluntary evacuation in place and my neighbor left and asked us to watch her house. Her entire shed blew away leaving her lawnmower just sitting there in the middle of her yard.
<0> that is cool , i've a job at subway that i am not thrilled about
<1> Do you want to meet there for lunch this week?
<0> I did it with the help of my lecturer. So I feel thankful for her.
<0> I'm sorry for the confusion, what's your favourite sports to watch
<0> Yeah. I should have thought ahead more about the weather,  I didnt think it could totally ruin the entire thing
<0> Oh, I've been there, it's so busy and cold at Christmas Time
<0> i am not cruel . i even donate to the homeless a lot
<0> I'm pretty sure that uncertainty influences the lack of communication in most serious relationships. If you do not know what your partner may say or do, you are unlikely to share.
<0> It was very gross to witness!
<1> It's not big deal, I wouldn't worry about it. 
<1> Wow. That must have made you happy to go one last time. I've actually there been to Kmart before. 
<0> True, I'm sure that if more people hiked, we'd be more healthy. Is it a popular form of exercise?
<1> I can also play very advanced music on the piano. I think I am almost as good as he is.
<1> Improv dancers always try to be unique each time they dance, so you won't see a lot of repetition. But normal performers follow rituals and strict choreography that they practice over and over. 
<0> I bet they probably are. I can't speak from personal experience though since I do not have a Corgi myself.
<1> No, you should take it at face value. A scammer would never do something like that.
<1> Ok, what team do you like in the NFL?
<0> tell me about your hobbies !
<0> I have no idea, but I do know that modern pizza was invented in Naples.
<1> You shouldn't be that sounds like a job from hell.
<1> I hope you don't get a good start since you took time off.
<1> no i don't , who is that ?
<0> No. I am not paid to play, too short to be a professional player unfortunately. 
<0> Agreed, but bread doesn't help either lol. It'd be easier to cut out other things like soda (I've done that) and chocolate (I'll never do that!) ;)
<0> Yeah. I meant to say is was not doing well, but it is ok. That's life I guess. 
<1> I decided to go with english.
<1> dude , you need to get outside , get some sea air
<0> The cats 5 years and the dog is only 1 year old.
<0> I don't know.  maybe it has to do with what point in the Saros cycle we're in. It kind of fluctuates over a period of a little over 18 years.
<0> that is a great name . do you like sweets ? i love cheesecake !
<0> yes , i am married and have four kids
<0> My sister likes red too! She goes to a public school near home
<0> My son is the first of his class in Math

<0> Oh yea not surprising, everyone trying to kill themselves with that stuff
<1> Yes! I love sour cream too! i want to start a mexican food business.
<0> Hawaii sucks anyways.

<0> So far the have to their collection of inventions automated teller machine (ATM), the PC, the floppy disk, the hard disk drive, the magnetic stripe card, the relational database and many others
<0> wow that s so cool charlie is the name of my cat
<0> I completely agree. Vegetarians or people who just don't eat meat but eat other animal products, are a little better about it.
<0> well , cake and all that other stuff is fattening , so we don't eat desserts
<0> I don't know. I've never touched one.
<0> I just don't like anything sewing or fashion related
<1> Is he still living today?
<1> Going to see your boss would be a bad idea.
<1> I did , I just came back from Japan last week.
<0> I hope so. I only have one year of school to go. I've started interviewing with some publisher already.
<1> i'm sure they have some sort of sadness.
<1> I'm a college professor at a private Division 2 College.
<0> Yea I hear you. My clients can barely stand me.

<0> nah , my fam keep their distance but i may start attending meetings or taking up aaa
<0> i'm picky about proper technique when it comes to food
<1> I doubt you have a chance as confidence isn't everything.

<0> I think it originated in the 14th century

<1> No...I hate that everyone litters and never pick up after themselves
<0> I did not but I did know  world's most accessible sport thanks to those bones everyone has.

<0> I like to use the internet to find recipes for steaks.
<0> Yes a great deal of them and i always add more things to my list. 
<0> do you go hunting ? dad has been on a hunting trip for a few days
<0> My friend hates Bon Iver and wants me to destroy all their albums.
<0> I did a project on hippos in my college zoology course so I learned pretty much everything that there was to learn about hippos like their name meaning, where it came from and their dietary needs along with a lot of other information about them.
<0> I'm currently there having a walk with my nephews
<1> I like photography too, I hate hiking
<0> Right,  mothers are great. Do you have any opinion on my friend?
<0> It is really unlike any other show, so you might like it.  I don't want to spoil it for you.
<1> Did you name Nala after the character in Lion King?  I love that movie!
<0> Nice, so if you had to choose a type of drawing what would you prefer? Pencils or charcoal or what?
<0> I kept my cool with him but I am a little frustrated over it,  I have no idea how to clean it up.
<0> Yes,  but ever since then,  i refuse to go down slides at the water park. 
<0> There's a cash prize at the end.

<0> I haven't actually, but I have been to The Outer Banks in North Carolina which is another pretty well known one. I love small beach/surf towns
<0> Nice. I didn't know that!
<0> You are crazy! Hitchhiking is super dangerous. I would never do that.

<0> Also, did you know that the Republican Party is the oldest political party?
<0> Oh yea nothing too hard but still hard to perfect.

<0> i work night shifts as well , but i've learned to live on way less sleep
<1> ya sure will do that
<1> I agree. I can't see myself ever wanting to get into baking.

<0> I don't need to do that I am already in love with someone.
<0> Me, too. I lost my best friend last year so I travel by myself. 
<1> i really can't relate. i have no family and don't understand the concept of love.

<1> Yes it's simple and new form of combat
<0> I currently don't play video games actually. 
<1> You did the right thing. I prefer to assume that people are bad and I always keep my guard up.
<1> Taking a Cruise right now is actually a bad idea, especially with this pandemic 
<0> I enjoy being a manager, managing people is fun.

<0> I sit at my desk all day and don't get much exercise. I need to lose fifty pounds.
<1> You should never get a tattoo under any circumstances.
<0> i don't fancy Mediterranean cuisine
<0> i think i could eat tacos every night.. i might be addicted
<1> Oh, I don't like spicy foods!
<0> yes. i loved the sound of guitar
<0> My favorite color is also pink.
<0> i gamble a lot myself
<0> Im not sure about brands but the FDA excludes soap from the cosmetic category. 
<1> that is pretty exciting . my boyfriend is a fan !
<1> I always have someone come with me, I never go alone
<0> It is not that the ball is far away, then you can say that you have won, sometimes it can be a sight to behold
<1> Are you near any state parks that you could walk through? I know they always have great trails!
<1> Yeah. That's why I want to be an astronaut.
<1> You could give him a punch to the chin and then walk off without apologizing the same way he did
<0> I've never had a chance to make a robot.  I have eaten a lot of different types of food, but never Chinese food.
<1> Exactly, haha! I guess a benefit of this job is that I'm not tired at the end of the day!
<1> Maybe you should cook for her one night.
<0> That's okay! What are some locations you would suggest I visit if I ever go there?
<0> I'm not practicing.
<0> Not really. I prefer alternative rock.
<0> It's some action-adventure stealth video game. I think it's the game that stars Solid Snake?
<1> Nah. You will do fine.
<0> Yup. I lived with my parents in that house.
<1> As far as I'm concerned, everyone I come across is a good driver, so maybe it was your fault for not watching carefully enough.
<1> I don't want to have children and my wife doesn't either.
<1> I wish I had a basset hound
<1> I know the words I want
<0> yikes , you have to make time for friends and fun .
<1> As long as you are doing activities together that is all that really matters.
<1> I don't have children.
<0> i love all types of music .
<0> We've been dealing with those also - they are considered an agricultural pest and I highly dislike them.
<0> Mystery, mostly. I like trying to figure out who did the thing before the author tells us. Sometimes I even get it right!
<0> i am the parent 
<0> I'm always afraid I'll die by a manta ray sting like Steve Irwin, giant mantas are especially scary. 
<0> Alcoholic drinks have caused problems for thounsands of years, its a drug and damages your body with too much drinking of alcohol
<1> Do you ever watch racing on the tv?
<1> Well you definitely have to see Big Ben and if you can get to Stonehenge, you won't regret it
<0> It's just upwards towards the clouds. If enough of it moves upwards the rain will fall from the clouds.
<1> I'm fortunate that my work allows me a lot of time with my kids, so we try to mix it up and add tacos and barbecues.
<0> I can't stand the show Frasier. It's too melodramatic for me.
<0> I've never heard of Southern Baptists before...
<0> Well I know boas get pretty long, they are among the biggest carnivorous reptiles of the suborder Serpentes family. 
<0> i hate dogs also i don't have children
<0> up north normally . dragons are cold blooded , even though they breathe fire .
<0> a real fast one ! you got a car ?
<0> It was more robust,  but not enough of an improvement
<0> I am not good at drawing
<0> So what's your belief as a Hindu faithful
<1> okay fine
<1> Obviously the population is more than 8.5 million in NY.
<1> I only buy makeup from Ulta. Ebay and Mercari seem a bit sketchy cause you're buying from random people.
<0> i don't have any siblings but i used to collect ladybugs with friends .
<0> I suppose, but I generally like to assume that people have good intentions. 
<1> No, I don't really care about the environment. I think global warming is a myth to stop companies from making money.
<0> It sounds like a waste of money. I don't have any money saved up, so I guess I won't bother
<1> Oh I do not have any pets.
<0> No, I'm vegan so cheese is also off limits.
<1> I'm not interested in other lines at all.
<0> Basically just variations of the usual picnic foods.  Burgers, brats, coleslaw, things like that
<0> That's probably true. I wish they would just make more of the older animated films like Lion King though, I prefer those over what Disney is doing these days.
<1> How, that's not fair, l should have got that card
<1> The Doberman are from Sweden.
<0> Anything would do. I don't care about what I eat
<1> I would love that too
<1> YES I know they can be..lol
<1> what kind ? what is his name ? ! woof woof
<0> I used to be, but I'm getting a bit old for all that tock and roll haha
<0> I do love acoustic. A favorite album is Skin and Bones by the Foo Fighters -- lots of their most popular songs, stripped down. Beautiful!
<1> I can't live like a minimalist. Hoarding as a trait has been passed on to me by my mother
<0> Yea I was freaked out because I thought they were poisonous or something. They also play dead,  they are weird.
<0> But why do you prefer an iguana? life expectancy is not so high.
<0> That's neat. So do you draw in black and white or do you use colored pencils?
<0> i hate the cold , in fact the only state i never visited is alaska
<1> If you like terror you won't enjoy Gothic fiction. It is not scary at all. 
<0> That would be nice but I don't have any siblings.
<0> What does NSF mean?
<0> Oh yes, I went there once as a child with my parents to visit a distant relative, it was extremely beautiful.
<0> Maybe so.  I don't think The Walking Dead is very popular, though.
<1> It should be healthier. I love to camp and hike. But I'll bring doritos instead of fruit too often. :)
<0> talking with horse and he replies the answer
<0> He got the Macan.  I am so envious of him.
<0> I love olives as well. 
<0> I only like dark chocolate, because the milk chocolate seems way too sweet.
<1> I'm originally from Maine, but I live in Florida now.
<1> That's surprising to hear since all Soap Operas are just so cheesy and bad.
<0> Oh my God! Did it ever happened with you at work too?
<0> I'm not sure i never read to my cat
<1> Really? I hate leather, I think isn`t a sturdy product
<0> I'm not a big fan of Bollywood. 
<0> harry potter , my three kids cannot get enough of it !
<0> Do you like the BBQ or roasted?
<0> Arsenal really sucks, man, I much prefer Barcelona!
<1> That's a nice name. I'd never get a cat, I hate them. 
<0> I love talking to people and mingle.
<1> Yes, and they keep finding new ways to create adrenaline! Makes you wonder what they will come up with next.
<1> great to hear that and you can give  a try to meet them
<1> homework is the most important thing to me, I always put it first. 
<0> That's great, given that it makes people happy. I'm sure it made good artwork. 
<0> I did! But it was so hard overcoming my fear of heights. I thought I was going to die on the way up!
<1> you probably deserved it, you must have done something wrong to make her leave you
<1> its good that happened  to you
<0> Drama is so boring and cliche these days for viewers. I prefer horror to keep me on the edge of my seat.
<0> Seems like they had it right.  Now there's so many chemicals and junk in many of them, especially the ones for nail art. I try to find ones that are free of the 10 worst chemicals. 
<0> No, I'm white, so it's not a direct problem for me.
<1> I have seen them is concert before though.
<0> I couldn't move my body. I fainted because she had introduced the guy to me as her cousin
<1> I enjoy solving problems, I'm a mechanical engineer at my job. I have only a few years doing it so I have a boss, but he is very relaxed.
<0> I couldn't imagine either because I've never seen an example of a single Mom but I undoubtedly would respect them!
<0> I never want to see them play
<0> I wish I liked to read and I would get a kindle.
<1> I wish I brought my own food, the tailgate sucks!
<1> yes . oregon is my homeland .
<1> well they got them , you miss any of them ?
<1> Thank you I am proud but it was either lose weight or die..sadly
<1> I teach maths at a college
<0> I felt so bad for not bringing anything.
<0> I agree, hopefully they get the hoarders some help too, otherwise they might keep doing this.
<0> I dont like it,  my sister does though.
<0> Cool, that sounds really nice. I do some painting but not as much as I would like. My brother has shown me some old stuff from his digs also.
<0> Yes, but on occasion I enjoy a juicy steak.
<1> I never get homesick like you.
<1> That seems very eventful. I had such a terrible headache yesterday that I called 911 for assitance!
<1> I don't enjoy playing video games. It is boring to me.
<0> yea, scary stuff. Being alone when the big dog attacked yesterday made it more scary 
<0> yes, the store was just straight and you can easily escape.
<1> What did you do?
<0> I do not trust the democrats
<0> awe , i always wanted to travel the world .
<1> My favorite driver is Kevin Harvick. 
<1> even i hate that too
<1> He's a well-built guy and that's important to me.
<1> Actually, yes, I am an athlete and play offensive line and love to tackle
<1> Good point. But maybe, just maybe, it'll be brilliant.
<1> i use to draw a lot , but most of my free time goes to my daughter
<1> yeah , we all have to stay busy . then on the weekends more studies . . .
<0> lets see . when are you two next free ?
<1> i'm sandy . . how is ur weekend going
<0> No I don't. I think pets are annoying.
<0> Be careful if you decide to give it a try because it is actually not regulated by the law in most areas, but ohhh what a thrill!
<0> I don't know. People drive horribly where I live. It's like a zoo every time I need to drive anywhere.
<0> Does Vermont have a maple syrup union that controls the price of maple syrup? I remember watching a documentary about maple syrup in Canada or maybe it was a providence of Canada
<0> wow, so which country is yoga more popular?
<1> Yeah, my parents never gave me any responsibility and it's really hard now.
<1> It's terrible there, I go every year
<1> I hate to take my dog for a walk.
<0> cool ! i don't know , that is why i am a workaholic , not time to think .
<0> I don't care about my clients I just do it for the money. 
<0> The Simpsons are great.  Gotta thank Matt Groening for the creation.
<0> oh ok i don't want my documents back
<1> That is good news!  I'm sure you will look forward to it as will I
<0> I've never really baked before. I have a lot to learn about cooking. What do you like to bake?
<1> That is good! What kind of car?
<0> you seem to know, do you speak another language besides english
<1> I know.  I have six kids of my own and the run me ragged.
<0> Everybody loves pizza, I have to get it with extra cheese!
<1> I gotcha. I bought mine online too. I also buy all my silver jewelry from amazon too. 
<1> I agree, people who do animal cruelty should be in jail. I have a pit bull and he is big baby....
<1> Sounds like Spanish soap operas, which I absolutely love!
<1> really, I drink but some selected drinks, I dont like whiskey
<1> i've seen some of the drone races where people fly from the first-person view, very intense
<0> No I have not.  But that sounds like a great organization. 
<0> I hope so! I've been trying,  but life tends to get in the way of course.
<0> No, not at all. I do things because I enjoy it.
<0> Sure they do but mine can only eat a specific kind of food or they get bladder stones which are very expensive to treat and if not treated will kill them. So its pretty important
<1> I would probably find it gross, I don't generally like candy.
<0> Wow! That's awesome! I've seen Andre Agassi speak, and love how he's mellowed and aged. He was definitely one of the most charismatic players in his day -- really a superstar, even beyond tennis! 
<0> yeah I hope so it's exciting and scary at the same time
<1> I disliked Luigi he controled funny and I rather use Toad
<0> Nice! I admire her roles and acting prowess as well as on screen looks - her hair being all fleeky and all, but I don't think she's a versatile actress at all! So one-dimensional!! 
<0> No, but a self breast exam and feeling the breast for lumps reguarly can catch any cancer early. 
<0> Just a check up,  but more if needed. I am always nervous when that time rolls around.
<1> I'm glad he's getting better with his speech and I hope he continues to improve!
<0> Eh,  we're not really the type to do that. Especially not him. And it's not worth it. Just a phone call here or there. Just miss the tradition is all. We're big family people
<1> I have an idea. How you write to them and ask them your bizarre fascination about how she smells.
<1> I agree. My favorite part of that movie is whey the guy shouts through the intercom at the drive through window.
<0> I buy them from the MaMa pizza place.
<0> It was going great for a first date,  but my bowels got the best of me!
<0> my first studio recording is booked for next week , i will find out.
<1> That's weird. Do twins run in your family? Are you a twin?
<0> will do . do you need help marketing for your business ?
<0> That is true. In Athen in 1896 and also in Paris in 1900. 
<1> I hear that it's not that common anyways
<1> I don't really know where it took place.
<1> I disagree, I'd never shop there.
<0> Which one?
<0> She's working on that now.
<0> Thanks you too. I will have to look up some French dishes to cook!
<0> I had one dog that liked to dig. I am just glad not all of them like to do it. Takes some work to fill all those holes.
<0> Thank you! It was quite an ordeal,  but I'm glad it's behind me and I can continue living my life!
<0> Because my sister did her major in geography in the past years and graduated from university.
<0> wonderful . do you have pets ? i'm going to adopt a dog
<0> That's impressive. I stay away from computers as much as I can.
<1> No I can stand Metallica. They are so overrated. 
<0> hopefully i do not have serious problems .
<0> I'm not much for reading. I'd rather watch a movie any day.
<1> You've really annoyed me and I hope you get what you deserve!
<1> I agree, being lonely is useless, does not help you in anything.
<1> i think you should lie, just joking
<0> Yes thats true i dont like big hussle and bussle ciities . sydney is the biggest urban place in all of australia. Its actually the part my dad was born in.
<0> Canada is relaxed with terms to taxes. I am not certain about America since i have never been there.
<0> It's unbelievable how cruel people can be. 
<0> oh okay dear bye
<1> It would really tick me off to be surprised like that.
<0> i do not know how to swim. i am afrad of water
<0> Really. I hope I never have kids. 
<0> since there are no children around , i can turn them up really loud !
<1> Awww that's nice,   just take care of them 
<1> I don't have a girlfriend right now.
<1> lol what are you going to do after you leave the army?
<0> Yes it is, that's what I use in my place of work.
<0> I am talking about the NBA. 
<1> My only job is as a baker so honestly I can't choose! I eat a lot of it though!
<0> It's amazing how the same effect causes both the color of your eyes and the sea to appear blue.
<0> I work at a fast food restaurant, but its quite ironic because I dislike fast food
<0> Luckilly I dried it up pretty quickly. so there was no serious damage. 
<0> too warm which is weird . i want some halloween kind of weather .
<0> I need to do that tomorrow
<1> Wow! I didn't even realize we had the power of 8k UHD high defition and that resolution in digital televsion.
<1> maybe you should have gone easier on him
<1> Lasagna smells so gross while it is baking.
<0> That's cool, I don't have many friends.
<1> They need alot of outdoor exercise, because of their tendancy to roam around.
<0> Yes it is. So many of the kids love talking about their interests and hobbies. It's a wonderful job.
<0> It's also common for those with red hair to have fair skin, light eye colors, and freckles. 
<0> I'm from the North Eastern part of Alabama.
<0> I have one more month of college then I will be done.
<0> yea but i like dr pepper
<0> o no italians are bikers and i am italian by choice
<0> Gyros! I fell in love with these suckers while working at the mall.
<0> Prince? Never heard any of his music i'm into rap.
<0> All my life! It's just a natural thing for me
<1> Adidas has so many different styles, that I can generally wear them with anything
<0> I've never had a job. I would like to find one some day.
<0> I'd say caramel filled. What's yours?
<1> i hate the pay,i wish i could earn more pay in this job.
<1> I don't really know anything about anything medical. What is diabetes exactly?
<1> Oh I never get discounts where I work my boss is very strict with discounts he gives out. 
<1> i am at home too but i have one close best friend .
<1> I'm not a sweets person, I've never even tried candy before.
<0> Either that, or the film he won an Academy Award for Best Actor - his portrayal of Jake LaMotta in the 1980 film "Raging Bull".
<0> I mean yeah,  a little. People asked if I was okay,  which was nice. But then it was silent after that,  and you could kind of tell people were probably thinking that I felt embarrassed,  which I did.
<1> every time i watch the movie gone with the wind , i cry .
<1> I have always been a vegetarian and I don't plan changing that. 
<1> aww what kind of puppy do you have
<1> absolutely ! fishing is something i've passed on to my kids .
<1> Ace Venture's series wasn't great either. 
<1> nice! do they get along or do they fight like cats and dogs lol
<0> i'm so sad the gifted program sent me a rejection letter
<0> quite a few . best part is cooking them !
<0> Me too, the 4th of July is my favorite holiday.
<0> Green is my best color, I just hate to see blue anywhere
<0> Yeah, I often see a lot of sneezing when there is a high pollen count in the air. At least I am not allergic to peanuts. I couldn't live without peanut butter!
<0> I don't like Justin Timberlake, he hurts my ears. 
<0> No, I've never done archery in my life.
<0> You might need a specialized knife for that
<0> 18,  so he's too young and I'm hoping the same. But if it is,  I will be there for him.
<0> Oh that was an older one. She had some good songs on there. Do you remember when Teenage Dream was released?
<0> No, that school was horrible
<0> or your english teacher . your spelling is horrid
<0> No I dont have the time but they are an intelligent dog breed just behind the border collie.
<1> That stinks,  but I am sure you got to see a lot of nice scenery. 
<0> Yeah, spiders are some of my favorite animals!
<0> there won't be currency
<1> It's scary, I wonder what people who had allergies did before modern medicine. 
<0> I heard that Chevy's technology isn't very advanced.
<0> i love red , reminds me of summer time .
<0> It just seems so exotic and far away.  I feel like I will love it there!
<0> Those are both good choices.  I like plain old cheesecake and pretty much any of them with real fruit on top. 
<1> I know you ate most of the ice cream.
<0> yeah its hard i hate winters its cold and brings me down
<1> Rosamund Pike was also in Romeo and Juliet, I think. Do you know any other films she was in?
<0> I hate soft drink, i only drink water.
<1> i dont thik this gift is awesome
<0> I can totally feel you. I don't like cook myself either. It's very time-consuming.
<1> I am only scared of hiking.
<0> That is really neat I had no idea their was so much information about badminton out there
<0> But I was able to find my checkbook in my purse luckily.
<1> Well like I say I fish but I also like to ski when I get a chance. Love the outdoors!
<1> Oh, sorry . Its just a smile expression.
<1> Yesh that can be hard to deal with,  but I believe you will have it all one day too.
<1> As long as I don't have to sing I'm in!
<0> it is the same company i work for,  so more of a promotion
<0> My yard got really messy and my back porch screen ripped but that is small compared to half of those in my area.
<0> Keep trying. A good relationship will make you forget about all of the bad ones
<0> I love being alone.
<0> Well, not so much. It is hard to find pizza in North America and Europe.
<0> Funny you mention that, because they do make it where it's soft, pliable and thin so that you can fold it in half to eat! I'm sure convenient because of that NY busy hustle and bustle!
<0> no but i still feel bad about it
<0> I agree with you because i don't like her acting at all.
<0> makes sense . what is your family like ?
<0> I live in an apartment in a big city, so there's no space to grow food. 
<1> sounds nice ! last vacation it rained , but that s ok because i like sound of rain .
<1> I'm of the opinion that you don't stand a chance.
<0> What should I spend my winnings on?
<0> I can't, I'm a vegetarian.
<0> The Boston Red Sox have won 8 World Series and have played in more than that.
<0> i've a dog . do you have any plans for your future ?
<0> I would say Formula One for sure! is the highest class for race cars with one seat that is organized by the FIA.
<1> Maybe going on her own is a good thing then, it can help her to see someone privately so that she can open up wihtout worry what you may think.
<1> I love to go to Las Vegas too.  Adults only.
<0> Kids hate water and I disrespect you son loves swimming.
<0> I don't like Joker, he is weak.
<0> I was born deaf.  My biggest regret is that I could never play a musical instrument.
<1> You have 20 kids!? I don't know how to count, I have always been bad at math.
<1> ll cool , i want to get rid of these cats ugh .
<1> Yeah we don't need revenge.
<0> in the US fries are mostly topped with ketchup but other areas use mayo, vinegar, and other things
<1> pens are quite expensive though
<1> I prefer books to movies.  Do you also like TV?
<0> Yes it seems like that. I'm going to get a lawyer and see what I can do.
<1> wow,  thats terrible,   where they even good looking?
<1> Sounds like you don't have the talent then.
<0> I guess I should be thankful I never got into video games,  I've never played them.
<1> I love thrillers too. They are too fun to scare me.
<0> i enjoy taking care of my dogs and running with them and you ?
<0> My health is the least of what would have changed things.
<0> do u like music ? i love taylor swift .
<1> She does not like any 
<1> well technically you cannot be a vegan if you eat eggs . you can be a vegetarian
<1> Yes, well there are too many good parents out there.
<0> yes they have, I like to emulate the lead singer though and I wear boots all the time
<0> yeah cool, you got the point
<1> i do not , i wish i did tho . i am trying not to relapse
<0> i would be good at drawing if i wanted to do it because i'm driven
<1> The meaning of Hindu has remained the same throughout history since it's original beliefs in the 1500s. 
<1> Me too and I don't know why it is called the bluegrass state.
<0> It wasn't that big of a deal. It didn't bother me too much.
<0> Yeah, I actually work as carpenter
<0> Corn on the cob,  steaks,  homemade mashed potatoes,  and cheesy brocolli
<0> I lived with my dad till I moved out
<1> I wouldn't do that if I was you. I've never been a fan of Civics they look a bit dull to me.
<1> during those time you managed very well
<1> ya it is fact
<0> Yes every sunday!
<1> I prefer glasses than contact lenses to correct my vision.
<0> Its not too far since i like in Utah 
<1> modern music is the best and my favorite.
<0> Literally I have two left feet.
<0> Well, It IS a mystery after all.  To tell what happens it it would spil the story.  But let's there's a reason the title is called "The Usual Suspects"
<0> wow that's cool do you like coffee
<0> O really? That's cool. 
<0> I hate big cities. They are too noisy and crowded.
<0> when last did you go to the cinemas?
<0> Thank you,  I appreciate that!
<0> I could not do that.  I have a fear of heights. 
<1> Wow, my parents go skydiving every weekend.
<0> No,  I punched her right in the nose like we do here! It's a tradition.
<0> old enough to have 2 kids
<0> Wow that sounds like a great place to visit! What else is India known for? 
<0> I don't really enjoy their music too much though
<1> No, i don't
<1> i am from tennessee , but i love to travel to see charlie daniels , he is my favorite
<1> Why did you ask him to do it, pop a lock is free.
<0> I moved to New York!
<1> She just got promoted to 8th grade English.  She's really excited.
<1> I can imagine so
<1> Same here, I could never eat meat.
<0> i have not lived in the mountain so i would not relate.
<0> that's very true. Colors do change as we get older, even considering how feminine/masculine they are
<0> No idea, I unfortunately don't know the first thing about him.
<1> It's really not that disgusting or a big deal since he was probably stressed out. 
<0> I've never been to a park before.
<0> Yes. I just like it best if I am out of town somewhere where no one knows me.
<0> I don't have allergies.
<0> Yeah,  it was really fun.  Plus,  I got to tease her about her Very Big 80s hair.
<1> I don't go to many pubs or taverns.
<1> ha ha ! ! well it helps when you enjoy football .
<1> I like the beach but don't live close enough to the coast to go all that often.
<0> Thats really interesting! I had no idea they did that in the past
<1> No, I think finding a suitable girlfriend is easy to find, so I'm riding solo for now.
<1> That's ok.  Employers don't look at your grades I don't think.
<1> I can't imagine how that would feel! I am glad my brother doesn't do that.
<1> not sure yet i want it to be like my favorite show rick and morty .
<1> Do you know much about wine? I don't really care for beer. 
<0> you seem to know nothing about pizza
<0> Draft evasion characterized every military conflict of the 20th and 21st century and those slackers stayed home and became politicians. Explains a lot doesn't it?
<1> Maybe, but first I hope to get something published!
<0> Thank you, It's a crazy experience. I've been reading a lot of Talcott Parsons books on the subject.
<1> That's a great thing! Not only does it save on carbon emissions, it saves on money!
<0> I can definitely see that being a reason as to why its such an overused diagnosis in children and adolescents. 
<1> basket ball is sometimes boring to me, this made me prefer football to it though.
<0> That sounds awful, I'm glad we never get bad weather like that, though to be honest, I do quite like to watch lightning when i get the chance.
<1> i am bored to look corn hole
<0> Yes, that would be the perfect reason to go to Tokyo, especially sometime between July 24th-August 9th since that is when the games will be held

<0> Sure, I a energized and would love to go.
<0> It is very interesting.
<0> I see a lot of cowboys in Tennessee where I'm from
<0> I agree. The best part is working in a darkroom and seeing the images appear. Way better than digital photography. 
<0> I am presently sitting buy my friend and his dog is running around playing
<0> same here, bad economic policies has made it impossible for me to have kids
<0> I am not much into reading but, you need to play sports to stay healthy though.

<0> I don't like shopping. I have my personal assistant do all my shopping for me.
<1> so are they friendly or not so much ?
<0> I do not like basketball, that is why I am a professional golfer.
<1> It's no big deal, I don't even know the person that the party is for.
<0> It did indeed. For the next few weeks I was too scared to even try and catch another ball. 
<0> Employees who work overtime can have some negative health effects. Flextime hapls employees feel in control.

<1> I don't have the patience for art, I'm terrible at it.
<0> ok

<1> Men are crazy sometimes!  LOL!
<1> Absolutely.  Good companions and calming too.

<0> Do they still exist today?
<1> I have never had pizza before, I don't like food much. 
<0> Yeah,  he's a bum!  He mooches off of her,  she works and he sits home and drinks.1

<0> i still get very nervous but i am working on it .
<0> Oh how interesting, I would've thought the smaller boats would catch the smaller fish, like shrimp, not the other way around. Do you know how much on fish average one boat brings in?

<0> Mystery Men
<1> That's good. I am happy that my wife is promoted at work.
<0> Yes, and many of the disorders have signs and symptoms that vary widely among all of the specific disorders.
<1> Dogs are the best, I wish I had a few. All I have is a cat.
<1> No, I haven't. My health situation and aversion toward driving keeps me from traveling much. Have you?
<0> Yes,  sadly I'm still an adult who still gets excited about video games.
<0> Besides animal welfare, animal rights, and ethics, there are many reasons to go vegan. Another one is that organic produced products and meat still contribute to animal agriculture.

<1> Me too. I have never rode a motorcycle.
<0> I work so i have time to play my violin with my band.

<0> Ya, I cant wait to be bored to death.
<1> that's so cool ! my mom is a music teacher .
<1> Do you have any 12 step groups near you? Those help I think.
<1> I am happy to hear that you did not get a computer because he paid for it with his own money and you did not. 
<1> Yes I love water, I try to drink a lot of it and avoid caffeine, caffeine is so bad for your nerves.
<0> i live in the suburbs of charlotte , nc
<0> Did you see any interesting plants and animals?
<0> No. I do not like to watch time consuming games. i'd prefer to watch football.

<0> You can try, but I'm not sure there are many places to do it there.
<0> i also like it
<1> That's good. come.
<0> You definitely need to get outside help, otherwise you'll go into burnout!
<0> It seems that my father had a stroke.  He's only 64!  We are headed up there tomorrow to see how he's doing.

<1> I think that everyone can agree with that!
<1> havent had a good steak in a while though
<0> I don't know, my school provides lots of personal attention to students.
<1> I agree. King of the Hill is hilarious. Much better than that awful South Park show.
<1> nice , i don't have any food allergies

<0> He did and thought I was going to hit him

<1> i hate people, and i don't care the way we work
<1> Are you married  
<1> Neat! Well, you can't be disappointed with pizza or wings! It is always goes great with watching football. Do you like watching sports?
<0> Yes, but I make concessions. The disorder is sometimes referred to as an "illness of lost opportunities" where "individuals make major life choices to accommodate their illness".
<0> i also shop way too much . i love buying things .
<0> for example the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships, but it is not an international competition
<0> Some people prefer to sing-along. The difference is sing-alongs have vocals but karaoke doesn't.
<0> yea it got bopped
<1> Yes, I have always had loads of friends. 
<0> yea , but it is good , i fix planes and drive junk cars and fix those too
<0> I feel like I let my roommate down by breaking some of our house rules,  and I feel bad for it.
<0> Its just that I feel anxious and think I am going to fail! 
<1> Really, where can I buy that today?
<1> I saw them last year with my dance partner. We had the best time.
<1> Yes, but i think it is not impossible.

<0> i am orginally from alabama but live in atlanta , ga now .
<0> my dog droopy would bark to make pickles get off the roses .
<0> Oh, that's not bad. I heard it was expensive.
<0> You too. The harder the better. I wish you could have helped.
<0> no , but sleeping is a big hobbie of mine so i might have slept through him .
<0> Definitely. Live music is the best...
<0> Definitely. I love to take breaks at gas stations and read books from many series. 
<0> Washington
<1> NOT EXACTLY I LIKE SPIDERS TOO. 
<0> That sounds good, I'm cooking meatloaf, it's my favorite.  What crafts do you sell?
<0> I guess if you were going for sushi, might as well go for the best. Think there is a big fashion industry there as well, and not to mention all the anime stuff... personally id like to go to some of the auto/car shows they have there.
<1> That's cool, I didn't know that.  I like showing older stuff to my son, see if I can foster an appreciation for all forms of artwork. 
<1> Yeah. I'm not fan of shoes.
<1> Yeah you might have to move to the city and see if you like it again.
<1> Oh I bet that was embarrassing. I have had that happen too.
<1> I wish you died.
<0> I love cooking. As a pure vegetarian, I like cooking vegetarian foods myself as the options are limited at restaurants
<0> I cheated on my beautiful amazing wife.

<1> Yes, there's a vegan restaurant five minutes from my house.
<0> Oh i'm so sorry to hear you were hit by the hurricane, was this very recently?
<0> Since I'm on the shorter end of the spectrum for men, I tend to act more macho than I need to sometimes.
<0> My life is terrible right now and nothing seems to be going right, I see no improvement.
<1> I'm actually looking forward to graduating college this year. I've worked so hard.
<1> yeah , i do not like that either . how old are your dogs ?
<0> That sounds great, Thanks I'll look into it. I have been dealing with my crazy wife for years and Ive had enough. 
<0> I have never been good with recording keeping
<0> Dogs are irritating and very annoying pets.
<1> that is fantastic . we need more people like you .
<1> No I don't - does not stop me from liking coupining tho!
<0> I don't like video games, I think they are a waste of my time. 
<1> I am not on any medication.
<1> Your dog is like my family.  The weather is the main reason they don't support me skiing.  They think it is too dangerous. 
<0> no I am not going to write mystery novel . i am a romantic type so romantic genre i chose
<0> Haven't heard of that one,  I'll have to check it out.  Right now,  I'm really enjoying Monster Hunter.
<1> Awe, that sucks, never gonna happen again. 
<1> Oh yeah true. Good thing, too because blue is ugly!
<1> It's probably diabeties on my part . I'm sure. I know a friend of mine that might be suffering from this. Does this illness arise out of some of alment. Like is it a secondary symptom?
<1> Im very sad to hear you are getting out of that home.
<1> it was with connor vs floyd
<0> Yeah, I'm really going to miss her kitten though.

<0> Not yet! I can't wait to go, though
<1> Really? Fart sounds disgusting, it would weird me out if that happened!
<0> I don't know what is going to happen.  I've been having a lot of stomach pain and the doctors don't know what it is.  I have to go to a specialist on Thursday.
<0> like barbie dolls or the porcelain dolls ?
<0> The student was just nervous and couldn't get over the fact of being in front of alot of people
<0> That is interesting. I have never been there myself. I'm going to be traveling to Florida and hoping to do some snorkeling there, just hoping I don't run into a shark
<1> sucks you cant find old movies anywere anymore
<0> Maybe I do! I hope that it doesn't exacerbate my bee allergy.
<1> Yeah me too. I never played one of those before.
<0> no plans yet in that regards
<1> you aren't lucky at all
<0> Yeah but i dont mind eating all those donuts as i am not on a diet or anything
<1> Very true! I might be scared to return to that store. Are you?
<1> You are really lucky to have great friends! My mother is so lonesome sometimes since dad died.
<0> Well, since I'm a vegetarian, I will have to try that recipe and see how I like it. 
<1> I don't want to try this vegetarian diet
<1> Oh okay, yeah i don't hunt really either.
<0> That's really cool! What is your new job?

<1> what food do you like ?
<1> Oh thats an interesting idea! I never thought of it that way thank you for that! 
<0> Oh they did, lol. I noticed in the least. I was covered in mud by the end of it too as the water people nicked the electric and they have mud everywhere from digging. I have a lot of anxiety so I don't like going out much anyway.
<1> Thats great to hear. Its good to care about your grades. but caring to much can be a concern. Have you mentioned it to her?
<0> Yeah,  He caught me. I apologies to him. But I feel guilty for his.
<0> No, just my two dogs.
<1> Yes i do love to build websites and currently working on that.
<0> I don't go camping.  I am not much of a nature person.

<0> mount Washington is not worth the visit
<1> yeah it is and i really want to get the most out of it .
<0> It is? But my hair is grey and not dark brown
<0> Oh I love modern music. A lot of it sounds much better than much of the old music especially the whiny, old country songs.
<1> are you an artist , i love painting as well
<1> i hate country, it sucks.
<1> That's a good reason, I guess.  Isn't there a tv show about hoarders?  I think I noticed it one day when looking for something to watch.
<0> Thanks for the suggestion. I'd also love to join one in school.
<1> That's great. I wish I knew how it felt to love your job.

<1> Sorry, I don't think so, I am very tight with my budget too. 
<0> I'm currently married now. She is the love of my life!
<0> I usually travel to different places, helping me meet new people and make new friends.

<0> Yeah I studied hard before and worked my tail off so I felt good about it!
<1> No doubt I can imagine how brutal a dog can be when its out of control.
<0> Yes, epilepsy medications can have some bad side effects. 
<1> Oh yeah,  why's that? Don't tell me you spilled some delicious coffee!
<1> The maintenance for your place is very poor. They need to improve
<0> Not really. I tend to be rather healthy and not get sick even if others around me are sick.
<0> yeah, when i grow up i wanna be an oncologist.
<1> they're 5 years old and by o twins

<0> It's hard to find a Job in psychology and in the economy you don't get paid very well.
<0> Yup. Are you staying in or going out tonight
<0> Toronto
<0> Agree. I am not very good at building, but my nephew built a roller coaster that stretched all the way up into the sky.
<0> I wish I could have a pet dog.
<1> lolipops, anything sour
<1> Losing a pet is the hardest thing that a child can go through.
<0> wow I didn't know that, thats a lot
<1> It sounds like a great song to me.
<0> i wasn't even born in the 1990's
<0> It was hot but the worse part was how spooky everything is during the night. I could not sleep at all.
<0> true story . i love to read , do you like to read ?

<0> Your very brave taking a challenge on like that! I hope you managed to help in some way
<1> Those dastardly kids! I hope she grows out of it eventually.

<0> Lou Gehrig's disease isn't a very big deal.
<0> does singing katy perry songs in the shower count ?
<1> you should look into that ! maybe art therapy ?
<0> Well, when you make a fortune like I do, who needs to worry about pennies?
<0> Ew, raw fish is gross, I can't stand sushi
<0> about a week
<0> It's a big debate in the collie owners. Collie it's self comes from Scotland but Rough Collie comes from Great Britain.

<1> I barely cook, i can recommend some good take out places.
<0> Well, best of luck at your party then.

<0> Good option.but select the new car not the old car
<0> i do its a private preschool . but just basic stuff , what about you ?

<0> yea it didnt but it was a pain
<1> We have a lot of hills where I live. 
<0> We were shooting for a fall trip,  but it's looking like it won't happen now.  I guess I waited an hour too long to hit the confirm button
<1> i hate honesty 
<1> Ok, thats a lot better
<1> I wish I had a dad like yours. My dad is a liar, and we have nothing in common.
<0> They were quite skillfull,  thats for sure!
<0> oh nice ! maybe we could travel to alviss place !
<0> Yes, my favorite thing to do is singing some of the songs that featured in some of episodes in public.

<1> Yeah I am a doctor. I spend the last 24 hours doing surgery on a patient
<1> oh no. i have been there don't that times.
<1> I can't wait for the weekend to end! I don't need time to relax.

<0> Me and some friends are going to Miami.
<1> It couldn't be what you ate, I cooked it. 
<1> I don't care for gardening myself.
<1> im sure it wont take you long with that degree

<0> I prefer the desert myself.
<0> No,  and He really shouldnt have told. He promised me. 
<1> My motto is "When you're feeling content, you're likely stagnating." That's a stifling feeling.

<1> They really lift up my spirits sometimes.
<0> Seems like it would be!  Where's the last place you hitchhiked to?
<0> That's awesome. There are tons of classic cars in my area.

<0> I do not care about wage slavery at all, all that matters is I make enough money
<0> Me too, i'm too busy with my job as an attorney
<0> since red hair required two copies of recessive genes its less common
<0> I suppose you have a point. They should just legalize dog fighting.
<0> So do I. Right now we are having perfect autumn weather and I love walking!
<1> his family must be going through some tough times right now ,  i hope everything goes well
<0> I normally put eggs and onions on pizza anyway. Just trying the tofu for some extra protein.
<0> Compsiracy theories are such a rabbit hole.  You start reading about one and they just lead to more and more.  Really wild stuff.
<0> hello , how are you ?
<1> I tend to just relax on the sand and read. I don't like swimming that much.
<1> Neither, I hate hiking and volleyball.
<1> I actually don't like that appliance. It is very hard to use...
<0> The toys are for girls too, so the adult men creep me out the most. The toys are made by Hasbro.
<0> i see i dont like spaghetti
<1> Yes, that is a good book.
<0> no . i will be working in the federal court system soon . are you married ?
<0> Yea Alaska has a border with mexico!
<0> And this is exactly why his listeners base is constantly decreasing and soon he would probably have nothing to do at all.

<0> They're not children, they're teenagers
<1> That's really cool! Do you prefer Argentina or the UK more?
<1> that's true . i do like warm weather too though since that's rugby season
<1> You're lucky. Being alone is so relaxing
<1> drawing is so boring.  
<1> I have to agree with your friend on this one. 
<1> That is not weird at all.
<0> Yeah very true, also he gained press notoriety for his admitted drug use 
<0> No, I don't really like comics.
<0> You must boil the eggs at the boiling temperature for them to cook. 
<1> A little bit.  I am horrible with remembering titles of songs though.  Are you a big fan?
<0> I would had made some if I was scientist.
<1> I am a wiz with computers.
<1> That sounds awkward, most importantly for the harsh weather
<1> you brother and mother didnt attend eat the dinner with you?
<0> i dislike the nerd stuff, i am more into sports and blaming people for not liking what i like. 
<1> Definitely a great combo. Maybe we can trade recipes sometimes?
<1> That would make me so nervous! I am horrible in front of people. How did it go?
<0> My wife and I have been talking about going scuba diving, I'd love to!
<0> It hasn't for robots. They are nothing like humans and resemble animatronics on Disney rides.
<0> Interesting, and how is the winning team determined?
<0> She use to have a rose garden.
<1> The Big Mac was introduced in 1967 and went nationwide the very next year so people adore that special sauce!

<1> I will never quit smoking, smoking is life!
<0> I never take pictures, but I would if I saw someone was reading the Bible.

<0> No, I am 82. I have been in many Olympics in my lifetime.

<1> Well personally I'm glad to hear that, you deserve it.
<0> MarkDuffus from the West Midlands in England 
<0> i know just thinking about it make me hungry as well ,
<1> I don't feel bad hearing about that.
<1> I did not! Is it good?
<0> Well i do not like dancing a lot, i think it is a waste of time.
<0> You are probably right. My friends say I am too gullible sometimes.
<0> That's cool, im more of a technical person so i guess my violin would be computers.
<0> Thank you,  I hope nothing ever happens to them!
<0> Me either. I don't even know how to swim.
<0> Thats one of the best parts, these small settlements and villages have such a low population density that everyone is friends or know each other, its great.

<0> She's at school so she wasn't too bad,  but I'll have to wait to find out this afternoon.
<0> I have a few neighbors.  We are able to watch out for each other, which is nice.  I have one neighbor who is a dairy farmer.  He mainly deals with milk; but he also makes some butter.  It's fantastic!  Do you like fresh dairy?
<1> Don't worry, $200 isn't that much money anyway. 
<1> I have never watched him
<1> whether is good
<1> i say peyton manning at the grocery store once .
<0> Yes,  thank god!  
<0> do you make enough to support your family ?
<1> wow exciting to know this from you. hope you will get succeed
<1> My boyfriend works a full time job 5 days a week
<1> I hate hanging out with my friends.
<0> I have never heard if classical swimming approaches before.
<0> oh, thats great but i read few books my favorite
<0> Yes and the funny part was I didn't realize until the meeting was ended. 
<1> Sometimes I think they do it on purpose just to make people mad. Should be fired for it tbh
<0> I found a dead rat up there,  now im worried i might have more
<1> I guess, but they can always teach them
<0> Yes, Its so vital to continue good health care even when people go home.  I think it helps their recovery to be at home too.  I know I would rather be at home than in a hospital.  I wonder how many nurses there are now?

<1> i have 1000 friends
<1> Yes, that is why I have never been on  a plane
<0> No,  I decided to save it.
<0> I think pets should be trained
<0> No,  I didn't. I am so afraid that they attack my family.
<1> I do, it can definitely be overwhelming.
<1> oh,  what happend
<1> My favorite right now is Mario Tennis, really a great game.
<1> That is why I like to have cat as pet only as they are home lovers.
<1> I don't like Cuban food that much.
<0> I am planning on it,  I hope my boss is receptive
<1> No, I don't usually watch or listen to the news at all.
<0> Yeah I hate that but I love all of his work.
<0> What are you talking about??? He's watching TV in the other room.
<0> you should stop doing that . get a dog .
<1> It's a little corny, but my wife and I shared our first kiss on the ocean, I've loved blue ever since.
<1> So, not a dwayne rock
<1> I play drums a lot
<1> Flirting can be extremely dangerous though. Especially if the one you truly love finds out. 
<1> I agree! My older brother used to have one and he would let me take it for a drive all the time.
<0> yes, i've read about that on the news. it's quite frightening
<1> Do you know the best foods to get vitamin C from? I know oranges for sure
<0> well , hiking i do enjoy it !
<1> Yeah, I agree. Who would ever want to do that with their wife?
<1> I rarely go swimming, I don't like it much.
<1> My favorite toppings are meats and vegetables such as onions and pepperoni. Yum!
<1> I know, You can't stop smart people from getting high paying jobs. I'm a prime example.
<0> If you want to be technical, any food with a corn tortilla wrapped around food is a taco, so even when I put hummus and some chicken nuggets in one, that's still a taco!
<1> That's pretty cool. So those random trucks that sell sandwiches are considered food trucks then? I never see them. 
<0> Yeah, it's pretty normal though, not too strange.
<0> You should !  His record contract was signed by the warner brothers 
<1> no,,, i like vets so much

<1> I am so stressed out!
<0> Yes,  he does it as a talent at various shows.
<0> Cinnamon sounds great, but I really hate the tastes of apples. 
<1> That's cool. I'm from the North where country music isn't too popular, so I wouldn't know that.
<0> That is cool, is card counting a strategy in blackjack?
<0> I'm looking for a job again, i've gotten so good at getting new jobs but I'm so bad at maintaining them. lol.
<0> Maybe, if its someone I really like. 
<0> Pit pulls are gentle giants.
<1> Most of the time I am too wasted from drugs to go out safely.
<0> Mac and cheese top the list of my most hated food.
<1> I am not sure, I have never heard of it either. 
<0> Yes. Definitely fun to visit sometimes, but not a place to live or raise kids.
<0> Yes,  he is a fighting machine.
<0> It is indeed very large and already too close to my house
<0> Yeah, my girlfriend and I watch the games every Saturday.
<0> It is unknown how many people still speak Ryukyuan.

<1> oh that stinks
<1> Making new memories is a waste of time actually
<1> I have a hard time with boxed mixes, so I'll leave it to the pros
<0> Gymnastics is very entertaining. What is your favorite team? 
<1> The rebranding made it better I think. What else do you know about Pepsi?

<0> oh,that sounds good and i too hate hospitals and had some bad experience with them
<1> Are your parents going to pay for your tuition
<1> it takes some time to become used to it .
<0> They are 8,  10,  12. They are the whole meaning of my existence.
<0> Wow! Bubblegum has been around for a long time. Do you know when the first lollipop was made? 
<1> It was beautiful. Do you like hiking?
<1> You should definitely try to get him back.
<1> Oh really, I watch sports every day!
<1> Hmm, that is interesting! One last fun fact for you, the word blond is for men and blonde is for woman. I don't know why the E matters though haha
<0> Oh, sorry, I don't know that. But you might be delighted to know that there are vegan and vegetarian festivals!
<0> Yeah, ,they tend to be really loyal dogs. And very smart, too !
<0> Its been about a year. We both moved away after college.
<1> Oh No! I hate cooking. I haven't cooked for even one day. 
<0> oh! i cant stand cats i think i am allergic to them
<0> I can relate, I find cooking to be time-consuming and stressful.
<1> Because, my twin brother aren't good enough in technical things and I'm used by their mindset.
<1> Oh, I've never watched it before. I don't like it very much.
<0> ew, why? Dancing is horrible.

<0> No it tastes horrible and isn't even edible so don't eat it!
<1> Yeah, I hate getting stuck in traffic.
<1> That sounds great. I like cooking too but I don't care for game days. Sports are boring.
<0> in my bed currently . my mom used to read stories
<1> I actually do not work.
<0> I am having steak and french fries for dinner tonight. It is going to be awesome!
<1> That's ok because I know sometimes people pee in the pools accidentally or on purpose so it's usually good to add some chlorine right?
<0> I don't know much about her, other than she is a child actress.
<1> Its not very nice that she would just leave you with nothing but a necklace.
<1> Yeah I used to love lifting weights but I am finding aerobics more fun.  Dogs are great although I have 2 cats. 
<0> I am sorry I may not be able to perform well if I do a tap dance for you as I am working for a large company that takes my time and I have no time to practise anymore.
<0> My parents worked at a grocery store and couldn't afford the best cars, but they got us from point A to point B at least.
<0> What era exactly was she from?  It was back when movies were shot in black and white, right?
<0> Omg Spyro was my absolute favorite game growing up. I bought the remake of it when it came out too. I'm glad you're enjoying it!
<0> Let me know what i's like, I want to see if Bob's Burgers is any good.
<0> I went closer to get a better look. The thing almost jumped on me. I was so shocked. It turned out to be a raccoon.
<1> You can play Madden on the Xbox for sure.
<1> I like my hair short so it is easier to wash and take care of.  No long hair for guys at work as well.
<1> LOL. Well I don't mind cooking if you pick up your dirty towels and put them in the laundry.
<0> Dad wanted to be a teacher but just couldn't do it
<0> I usually do. Give me a few drinks and I will have my own gathering. But I need to get ready for the academy. 
<0> Ok cool. Which automobile company make the most of these?
<0> We love our parrot, but it really likes to scream and chew. I often wonder if they are actually good pets.
<1> Nah I am not a fond of watching games would rather watch movies instead.
<0> Yes, but I wish I had an Ex.
<0> Yes, it is part of the Wal-Mart retail chain. But the customers and atmosphere inside of Sam's is much better. 
<0> I am from KY
<1> Yeah, it probably would have been better if you weren't adopted. 
<0> Yes, am happily married and living together with my wife.
<0> That's one more thing I know how to do. good for saving some money for sure.;

<0> I planted some tomatoes and collard greens.
<0> I'm not too familiar with the public affairs industry. Just trying to educate myself.
<1> Not really. I don't like art that much.
<0> I just have one more year to go. Can't wait!
<1> oh yea , do you like puzzles ? i enjoy them
<1> I don't think there's a big deal in what the dog is doing.
<1> Yes, you can find it in every bookstore and online book retailer.
<0> Actually I have not. However, I have thought about going to a grown up version of summer camp like maybe a dude ranch!
<0> Yea they are often called house cats in certain parts of the world too, In some places they kept as indoor pets or simply cats when there is no need to distinguish them from other fields and felines. But yea they are all over the world! 
<1> do you have a dog? i have two dogs.
<0> I didn't play a guitar.  I played the drums!
<0> yeah i only have a year left in school and i'll be done 
<0> Radiohead is AWESOME Thom is the man! I've seen them live!
<1> Hanging out is not good for them .. they should be responsible and not out partying. 
<0> I remember cliffhangers it was formed with Charles Dickens.
<0> Good for him, but it's not like I have an interest to see one of his pieces or anything
<1> I don't think you should keep that. It could make you depressed...
<1> Oh jeez.  Were they treated in a brutal or degrading way in the book, or was it a more quiet kind of treatment?
<0> That sounds awful, I hate spiders so much nevermind bigger creepier ones with big stingers.
<1> I don't know, I prefer my hair natural brown. 
<0> I am retired and live on Miami beach. I don't work anymore.
<0> I don't eat cheese, I am not a fan
<0> Yes,  I do not like the Red Sox.
<0> That's really cool, gives you a visual clue into how to better eat and choose your meals. Thanks for mentioning that one. 
<1> I only have a little brother
<1> Oh I see. Well I'm sure you can practice some! Cooking goes back a long way, 2 million years ago! I'm sure they didn't know what they were doing either.
<0> It was hard the first few times but this time it was oddly very easy.  I think i have finally quit for good.
<1> I m a kind of person loves getting new vehicles.
<1> sounds peaceful ! maybe i should think about moving the kids and i
<0> nah he is chill he is a california puppy hell just make fun of you
<0> i agree.  i like the newer shows with a ton of action like agents of shield.  i don't like the dc shows too much.
<0> I feel comfortable when people make cat calls at my rear.
<1> Wow, sounds like going to Washington worked out well for you!

<0> i'm in high school , did my studies earlier this evening . i like chasing cheetahs .
<1> yep . last season and i am pumped for it .
<0> Yeah, it's a long and boring show, the characters aren't that interesting.
<0> My favorite team is the bluejays, I don't like the tigers.
<0> Unfortunately not. I was so upset! Thankfully,  my dog was okay - just needed some rest and a cast for a couple of months.
<1> You are too old to play those sports. 
<0> That is really nuts.  I know that during the civil rights era, the Southern Baptists were pretty split on the issues of the day.
<0> That's awesome. I wish I had kids.
<0> Yes, those are so much fun. If you could enter any kind of talent show what would it be? 
<1> I think you're right. Not knowing is sometimes better. 
<1> Yes and no wonder  The "Mona Lisa" is one of the most valuable paintings in the world! It is truly remarkable! 
<1> i'm a swimming instructor .
<1> Or you can learn from your parents. Having disobedient kids is a sign of you being a bad parent.
<0> Well that certainly is an interesting way to phrase it. What do you eat?
<1> You should just let her cheat. No one is really going to care.
<0> Well, I'm not a criminal!  LOL!  What other fun fact do you have regarding tattoos?  
<0> My wife and I just found out that we are expecting our first child.  Its pretty exciting.  I gotta start saving up money now though.
<0> I understand. Do you see a doctor for you condition?

<0> Tattoos were seen as uncivilized for most of history

<0> The early portion of the design by Coco Chanel was mainly for men, so I'm sure you can find plenty.
<0> They have difficulty reproducing. There are currently only 239 living in captivity in China.
<1> Singing gives me nightmare. I hate it.
<0> What are your hobbies/ interests?
<0> Im not sure, possibly some sort of counselling if it is due to a traumatic experience.
<0> No, I only know that the idea was brought to life by Elon Musk.
<0> Me too since I don't have a dog.
<0> Believe it or not,  he was well prepared. I consider it a glorified move to California,  but he seems happy!
<0> I don't just watch plays, I write and produce them for a living!
<0> Kind of. This, coupled with the fact that they are indigenous to some of the more densely populated places on Earth, 
<1> Good to know that!  Do they come in different species and colors?
<0> that's something to aspire to be . i am impressed
<1> oh nice . i ordered pizza since its my favorite for the night .
<1> I wish I could make some money that way, it would help me to pay all of my parking tickets.
<0> They seem to tear a bit easier, but they do have a good flavor.
<0> the world does need a big ole bandaid
<0> I sure hope so! Well, have a nice day!
<1> swimming is nice ! i agree
<0> Okay. But I do not like fishing. It is a waste of time
<0> im sure she will be, after why dont i come over and we eat some good tofu.

<0> That sounds too intimidating to me personally, I'd rather just pay someone to do it for me
<0> No, he is dead.
<0> Yes, I love baking them in the winter. It's my favorite season.
<0> I do not.  If you see one somewhere let me know.  That would be a very unique item to add to my collection!
<0> Well yes,  my instructor Marissa is so dreamy. But still... I see the way she looks at Mark.
<0> Our family went there with some friends last summer.  We stayed in Corolla, and loved it!
<0> What is your favorite thing you ever ate at a Parisian cafe?
<0> I love travel too. I speak French fluently and try to travel to another country at least once a year. What countries have you visited?
<1> Yes, she's definitely my personal favourite tennis player. 
<0> Family in a way. That is great that you have grown as a person! It is rare. They complain when they have things good and still aren't happy when it's bad?- I don't get it- I don't get people who want to stay in misery
<0> Since my best friend moved to Japan it seems like I do this more often than not. I need to get over it.
<0> i've one elder than me
<1> I hope to never see her again.
<1> That's awesome. I like a variety. My clothes are usually the colors of the rainbow. 
<0> We were together for thirteen years.  Married for eight.  It's actually for the best for everyone.
<1> That made you cry?  You are a big sissy. 
<0> Whenever I get a full 8 hours sleep I wake up starving!
<0> Physics 
<1> You really failed on that one and will probably struggle next time.
<0> Have you seen the movie, Frozen? I've been waiting so long for part 2.
<0> a lot of words derive from latin it is very common hgahah
<0> Yep, I also play the guitar. How about you?
<1> I can't see being distracted by all the choices. 
<0> Aha,  I'm sorry! If it makes you any less hungry it's a vegetarian pizza because the wife doesn't eat meat.
<1> How are you handling your finances?
<1> I relieve my stress by watching TV. I hate music and have never played an instrument.
<0> I love listening to live music.  It's so much better that reading or listening to boring audiobooks.
<1> Ouch!! Maybe one day I'll be brave and go for it! I wonder what cultures support nose piercings, do you know?
<0> watching him struggle all that time,   It was nice to see him win.
<0> i look very good on my dress this evening . and i hate live action role paying 
<0> Indeed. I am very excited for it and hope the monthly payments will go as expected
<0> but each culture has some food preferences
<1> I find it rough, can't stand all the kicking, have no interest for it.
<1> Yeah I couldn't teach people, I don't like kids that much
<0> that's interesting . what is russian food like ?
<1> Well you should be disappointed in yourself. This is the last competition you can be in. 
<1> Also me they are not such a favorite to me I love dogs anyway.
<0> It seems to be happening a lot because my best friend had a miscarriage too about a month ago.  I will definitely keep trying to be with her and bring her meals and clean.  I cannot shake the sadness either so I have to force myself to be positive around her.
<1> Not really, I've finished everything I needed to do before my vacation.
<0> You should learn about when it used to include stuff like snails, slugs, and earthworms too.
<0> I don't like to explore. I'm an indoor person.
<0> It is recent. It has been two months now.
<0> That's exactly what I did! I don't have a pool table down there, so I held onto a support column for dear life!
<0> it came as a surprise, i don't deserve it.
<1> I'm no good because I'm too short
<1> Stick with people you have known for a long time.
<1> It's actually great that she never met him while he was sick!
<0> I thought about it - but then my friend decided to park his new car there!  I'm pretty upset about it - it is my spot after all.
<0> I know me too! And the blood brings things called phagucytes to the area which removes all the bits of bone that are not viable.
<1> the crowd makes the live perormance cheerful
<1> I dont ever wing it for that reason, you never know what could happen.
<1> wow . such a small world
<0> I also play guitar in my university after i complete my engineering classes.

<0> beetroot was used as a treatment for a variety of conditions, especially illnesses relating to digestion and the blood.
<1> No, living your dreams is a waste of time. 
<1> What kinds of animals do you hunt?  I've never tried it.
<0> I actually hate video games, I do not think they are fun at all. 
<1> It shouldn't.  I doesn't sound very impressive to me.  
<0> oh i was home schooled
<1> that is great! your manager really love you. you have a great relationship with your manager.
<1> Me too. I can't stand the popular stuff. Give me Marilyn Manson over Katy Perry any day!

<0> church founders have recommended vegetarianism, such as William Cowherd from the Bible Christian Church and Ellen G. White from the Seventh-day Adventists
<1> I don't know what enslaved means, that sounds fun.
<0> True. It just depends on what is being communicated. Drawing is a popular means of public expression.

<0> I agree! Especially since they found a Priestess of the Goddess Hathor from ancient Egypt mummified with tattoos
<1> I also have a brother and we are very close
<0> I think they went downhill when they released those boring movies toy story and finding nemo.
<0> I don't like that spot. It's boring..
<1> You'll just fail the exam and have to take it again.
<0> Thats a good one. He's career was kind of going down hill and got reborn in 1953.
<1> I think they still played together up until the early 2000s, maybe 2010s. They lost one of their members, John Lennon, when he was killed in the 70s.
<0> Yes, but I didn't ever watch it. I think she's bad at making TV sows, she's not very creative. I can't stand to watch My Little Pony which she made.

<1> Dress up. Last year I gave our candy. This year I'm hosting a Halloween party/ b-day bash.
<1> That's really awesome! What kind of lyrics do you write?
<1> Not really. He was behaving normally as he would. By the way, are you knowledgeable about brain disease called dementia
<1> not too long i only have like 2 or 3 they don't take up much space in my wardrobe
<1> It seems really irresponsible for you to just leave him with strangers like that.
<0> I don't really care to know about any indulgent vegetarian recipes.
<0> I've noticed that.  We are surrounded by propaganda constantly.  It's a lot like Brave New World.
<0> That could be true. I wouldn't know though, I've never had a pet.
<1> wow, now that sounds amazing.  Its almost Thanksgiving soon, ill have to start looking up recipes.
<1> I'm happy to hear that you have a bad luck with relationships

<0> I'm not interested in learning about it. 
<0> Yes, the Rap music is what I love to do.
<1> I think we would make a great team. We would both be able to achieve our dreams. Maybe once I move out of my parents home.

<1> Well, I'll put on my best public image and try to block out the people. I'm glad you enjoy your work!
<1> I like sports games like the NBA Experience or Madden Football. Do you play those?
<0> That sounds fun. I need to find a new hobby since all of my friends just watch sports and I'm not interested in sports at all
<1> Yeah, I’m glad I don’t live in New York anymore.
<0> I applaud anyone who's willing to work through pain. I also do it on a daily basis and without excuses.
<1> He's single like me.  Maybe I should look him up!
<1> I dont need any luck, College is pretty easy and relaxing.
<0> That's very funny, I happen to be a Canadian women myself.
<1> yes it was and i too like simpler times . what about tv shows...do you like anime ?
<0> Wow that's cool. I am from Barcelona but I don't know any spanish.

<1> Sound awkward, there's nothing catching about it
<0> RIght, we have already been on one date.
<0> I didn't like the little mermaid, beauty and the beast was my favorite

<1> That's fine with me. Nothing better than a hot summer day. Love the feeling of a sweat with a breeze.

<1> No, not much of a movie fan, but Country Western music is my favorite.
<0> Well I have three and I couldn't agree more.
<1> i wonder if being tall would help run away from bees . i am very allergic .
<1> salads i try to stay in shape and listen to music most the day. I drink a lot of water too
<0> It was a hand written note from my dead mother. I never had read or seen it before. 
<0> I;ve never heard of that movie and I'm a pretty big horror fan.
<0> yea it was,  and it was kinda gross towards the end

<1> probably. They will remember it when they see you or they come to that place.
<0> i bet it is , you should get help
<1> yes black . how about you ?
<0> The cops don't do anything here. They don't even come for gun shots half the night...It's the wild west here. I ran over and got her and he ran in his house like the loser he is.
<0> I can't this week because I busy with brother that just got out of jail.
<1> I definitely recommend you do. I also found a funny hat for my dog at the thrift store. Do you have any dogs?
<1> actually, I don't really like surfing.
<1> yea but i don't prefer that one.
<1> Oh! my mum lives in my house
<0> It was such a relief. I was afraid I'd pee my pants or something.
<0> Sigh. You are right. That might help with the rent or car payment. It won't help my in my classes. I can't believe that I'm failing GYM!
<1> Washington Irving was another key literary figure.  He wrote awesome books!
<0> That stuff would be a hit, given the right crowd!
<0> At the beach,  I was really scared at first but it was actually exciting!

<0> I hate pizza so I guess I am
<0> I usually have a few when I'm with friends. It helps me loosen up and not e so socially awkward.
<0> I am very behind on remodeling kits, there are some plastic ones in my collection.
<0> Nope, but that would be pretty cool to be honest. I've always wanted to :(
<1> Well, at least the kids got to skate today after all! I'm sure they loved that.
<0> He graduated a long time ago.
<0> I am going diving,  parasailing,  and zip lining!  I can't wait!
<0> She has been mean and making sure that everyone knows. That is the thing.
<0> food is the only thing i love.
<1> I wouldn't have been scared at all, you should toughen up. 
<0> Pumpkin cheesecake is incredible, too!  I enjoy it seasonally.
<1> I could never be a server. People are so rude and entitled. 
<0> it happens i still keep active but not as much
<1> me too but im not a big fan of broccoli or cabbage. I just get hungry when food is talked about.
<1> Have you ever tried to rent them or get the e-books?
<1> that sounds fun, i drove my car to New York last weekend.
<0> An old beat up car that I need to replace but can't afford to.
<0> Cursive was my favorite subject at school

<0> Thanks! I didn't think I'd get here lol
<0> Do you know what the first one was?
<1> I'm no fan of volleyball. I really don't do sports at all, it takes too much effort
<0> like they introduced me to this self-employe gig they only do part time...and now I pay rent and bills with it,  plus save some extra....and they still want to do it part time and keep their dead-end jobs they complain about!
<1> What are the books about? 
<0> He started out on radio but then took off and appeared in more general works including HBO, CNBC, and syndication.
<0> i actually dont know the difference!
<0> ahahah ! i have heard this before . . . can this really be true this time ?
<1> That's nice.  My brother lives closer to my mom about 20 miles away.  But my sister lives a mile away.
<0> Well I'm involved in local community theater. It's really easy cause I'm not that shy.
<0> Yeah,  they are. Especially when they seem to be particularly skilled at being elusive for whatever reason. Like some of them just got additional expert training or whatever
<0> Me too! But I don't really cook much, so I don't buy them very often.
<1> Yes meet new people!
<0> I won't like to be a vegetarian at all, no matter the benefits.
<0> my mom works at apple . are you a mom ?
<0> No. He just went "oops". He's so uncaring sometimes and gets drawn into his work. I really should know better by now
<0> Nope. But i did giver her a little funeral though. I loved that cat.
<0> Unfortunately, Ford has not trying to expand its global battery research.
<0> Yes, that is when finance is very important, when it comes to retirement and such. I don't want to be a broke 80 year old. 
<0> that is impressive . my only claim to fame is i was once on the news .
<0> Sadly yes... I don't know how I'll get over it though.
<0> They are also refeered to as siamese fighting fish
<0> I have to wait for 'free swim' at the public pool, so not as often as I would like, but a good two or three times a week.
<0> I really don't know anything about it.  I've only heard of it by name.
<1> I don’t want to know about it
<1> I love the blue candles, they remind me of the ocean. Have you ever been to the ocean?
<1> Because I need to purchase boots for my collection. I love boots, it's an obsession.
<1> I have never seen that. My dad loved that movie though, talked about it all the time. 
<0> Yes. I go to the hospital every day.
<1> Maybe i should look into that type of job as i live alone and prefer it that way!
<0> I hate onions.
<1> Yeah.  My king charles spaniel is 5 and is one of the most popular dog in our town.
<0> I would think it wouldn't feel the same with my second daughter,  but no,  it felt the same way all over again.
<1> It will be a great escape from regular life,  right? How often do you get to go?
<1> My dad doesn't listen ti jimmy hendrix
<0> I'm not sure. I don't live them anymore. I live in Minnesota right now.
<0> Oh I know.  I have so many friends that think she is the best.
<1> oh , i am so sorry to hear that . that must have been difficult for you .
<0> I have over 500 stamps, I store them in my stamp binder, made specifically for stamp collectors. I love organizing them by country from where I get them because each one shows a unique historical and geographical aspect of the country on them. 
<0> I am sure it will look beautiful
<0> Yeah,  I am grateful at the moment
<0> yeah, i just hate smelling like it though. what do you think about pineapple on it?
<1> You must have not loved her that much. She got away from you.
<0> I like tattoos too. I might actually get one. I mean, it's not like I'm going to die in the next 6 months.
<0> i like to go with my friend
<0> Does New York have good street food?
<0> Yeah,  it's hard,  since I feel like what I'm trying to communicate to them isn't getting through. They repeat the same thing a dozen times, and then maybe they start making some progress. It's hard for me to see them run into the same wall over and over,  so to speak. But you're right.
<0> Acura is a good automobile brand
<0> I really like Call of Duty
<1> Oh yeah? Well I think you were irresponsible, and I wish you had gotten hurt!
<0> you are so lucky i cant have animals because my apartment wont let me
<0> when i get up i am going to cook some chicken and rice ,
<0> I could only imagine the photos.
<1> I don't know...it still seems expensive to me.
<0> I was just in distraught
<0> I never knew they had islands, Whats Honshu like? is it tropical like other islands I see?
<1> I already have a couple kids, no need for more.
<0> Well it felt like I was looking into the mirror of my own soul and emotions
<0> I think it is about Friday at work.
<1> Thank you but i really don't need your money, i want to take care of myself, not rely on other people.
<1> Me too. Having at least 1 child would have been so fun for me.
<0> me either.
<0> It went well,  my dog came back happy and healthy. My cousin did well to pay off my trust. 
<1> Do you think your cat will come back?
<0> Oh I've heard a lot about role playing games, but never cops and robbers!
<0> Well then we agree! So you're just upset that I was claiming to be an expert while you have truly done the work to be an expert?
<1> That must suck for you, I've always had perfect balance. 
<1> It will be so hard to wait that you won't feel better when he comes back.
<1> sounds like he was a huge jerk. 
<1> I don't know.  I really don't like eating out anyway.  Home cooked food is so much better.  
<0> I personally love broiled steak that is well-done.
<0> Who is your favorite rock artist of all time?
<0> i'll , thanks . i have a brother too , but have not talked to him in forever .
<0> Me? I keep it simple, with cheese pizza. You don't need too many toppings, in my opinion. That's why I love Italian cuisine in general, as Italian cooks choose quality of ingredients over elaborate preparation, and they go for simplicity, with a lot of dishes limiting themselves to two, maybe four main ingredients, tops.
<1> I eat healthy food and exercise daily, That's why
<1> I hate it when that happens.
<1> i wish not to aruge wt myself regarding this.
<1> 5 is my least favorite number! No thank you.
<1> well , not so much . i like novellas now . get too tired reading .
<1> Oh wow. Someone must have loved it.
<0> Yeah, my friends are the same and so I've never been to a night club before
<0> Yeah, I miss that, as I'm retired now, so don't get much interaction with people during the working week.
<0> I don't know how you can stand being around cows, they stink so bad.
<1> Yeah I guess so. Do you have a garden?
<1> I hate reading the bible I find it so boring. 
<0> Perhaps that why they kept the car running at the beginning!  I think I will stick to grilling, which dates ack to the late 1860s and early 1870s.
<1> Yeah but I don't think I am very skilled at it, definitely need to improve.
<1> well thats not nice I hope she stars treating you better
<0> purple is my favorite color . i will tell them to let me wear a purple uniform .
<1> good choice, horrible first name
<1> I agree, I love having good neighbors.
<0> I hope she is ok.  I don't like roses because of all the thorns
<0> how nice . once i get my bachelors degree a great honeymoon spot
<0> No judgement. It's a fair amount of money. I can't say that in the future I won't go back to bodyweight exercises like pushups and squats which don't require machines.
<0> I never hide things from my family.
<0> Oh yeah, I'm a fiber artist
<0> I prefer medical dramas but recently I favor catching up on movies. I hope the new Harry Potter books get a movie adaptation!
<0> It is an expensive hobby, luckily I had some help from family. 
<0> He is a good friend so I wanted him to be able to come by when I am not there and check on things. Also if he wants to hang out for a while.
<1> no . i did not bother with relationships through school .
<0> A lot of EDM. Music hippies listen to haha
<0> It was just my first one. That and my job loss have done me in. This is my rock bottom for sure!
<0> I work full time as a deliver driver. 
<0> They seem to be a copy of every other team, very bland and boring in my opinion.
<0> Oh yeah there's the dolphins, the heat, the marlins, plus the famous "U" of the Miami Hurricanes!
<1> good for you . Music is not my thing, I'm clueless and don't know which is which honestly. 
<1> house door is which wood.
<0> more power to you .
<1> I agree, I am a Republican but Democrats agree with me on most issues.
<0> I have never seen Annie, whats it about?
<1> Honestly none, the cooking process really stresses me out. 
<0> vegans are even more restrictive than vegetarians
<1> I will turn 18 years old next Tuesday!
<1> maybe . you were not this type of child ?
<0> Me too, I've never tried them myself. My hearing aids mean I can't use them
<0> Actually I know a lot of people who have parents who works as a make up artist.
<1> I like to sit on my front porch and listen to that old music.  I have a house on the countryside.
<0> Most mammals fur are the same not much is different 
<1> I work in Seattle. Have you ever been there?
<0> So did you set out any types of person or look that you didn't want?
<0> he has recieved three grammy awards, two bilboard music award, two america music, an mtv video, and world music award while part of marron 5 so thats definitely a yes haha
<0> I am too,  it was something though
<1> awesome ! ! do you have any pets ? and match houses are too cool
<1> I'm very sorry for you. 
<0> Yeah that's pretty much exactly how I feel, but hanging out with my friends has definitely helped. Also, I find it strange that there is no real accepted definition of boredom.
<1> Maybe you guys might get back together
<1> Oh well, if they cancel it, they will find another show to work on.
<0> Yup, I am trying to get tools and stuff I need by September. 
<0> Yes and I guess Pepsi hasn't been as popular, even though their recipe has sugar and vanilla.
<0> Well, the military use it as a component of their military training and have done so historically.
<1> You should because we don't have any rock bands here.
<0> Yeah I bet. It's a lot more expensive than my little Hobie Cat. I like a beach catamaran in the bays and inland waterways here in Florida.
<0> That's true.  Sadly I leave food smudges on books!
<0> oh yes I love teaching, I enjoy being the centre of attention
<0> It was. I felt so relaxed and one with nature.
<0> Make sure we have an escape route planned in case we have to evacuate. Make sure we have loads of bottled water,  canned foods and things like that.
<0> I'm hoping the relationship gets serious.  She's lonely and needs someone she can trust in her life; I think this could be the one!
<1> I know why he did it.
<0> Yeah,  back then I was able to stay up all night an be just fine!
<1> ewww thats so gross.  I hope you didnt have to clean it up
<1> Gardening is not fun for me, so I don't do it.
<0> I actually did not attend college.
<0> yes ive experienced that myself sadly! feelings guilt and ashamed in addition to restlessnss are some of the worst symptoms ive personally experienced. i
<0> I have no plans to do anything tonight. I might just watch a movie or read a book. 
<0> I have a massive backyard and was thinking of getting a pet
<1> She probably won't enjoy it, I would get her something else.
<0> I actually work as a cleaner in the library.
<0> The romaine lettuce doesn’t tolerate heat. 
<0> that might be good if you get along with them .
<0> I'm a terrible cook. I usually just follow the instructions on the box when I make something. Do you cook at all?
<0> I wouldn't bother with sweat wicking clothing - the climate is arid so if you do sweat, it dries up quickly. 
<0> Those historical stories aren't real.
<1> i cant make hot sauce, i don't like to get my hands deity that why i hate gardening 
<0> Sure thing, I have been dieting myself these days so I know what it is like.
<0> Publix is nothing like HEB.
<0> No. I don't like fish
<1> i am not happy its not available for me 
<0> I bet it would be a great place to work!  I love coffee so I wouldn't mind working at a place like that.
<0> I would love to live there and have access to so much nature and history. i hope to visit it some day at least.
<0> That sounds great! I hope to get married some day.
<0> No, i like the rock music.
<1> I don't think everyone lies. 
<1> It will be good for you to get rid of them and be around new people.
<0> I wish I could like Titanic, it's so famous.
<1> I'm lucky to live in a safe city with no crimes and no gun activity.
<1> i am sorry to hear that .
<0> What else do you know about tasty tasty pork?
<0> I love when I go to political rallies. I get pumped when my favorite politician comes out and pumps up the audience!
<0> What is your favorite style of bathing. Using the shower or the tub? 
<0> i need to eat more veggies . maybe it would help me lose the excess weight .
<0> I’m not going to Kentucky. 
<0> i don't know why i go . i don't even like mexican food . lol
<1> Salad pizza? I haven't heard of it. What is it?
<0> Yeah you're right about that
<0> They are very entitled for sure! The emphasis on consumption reminds me of the 80s.
<0> Lol yeah, do you remember that hidden camera joke television series he ran called Punkd? I remember when that first aired on MTV in 2003. Good times. 
<1> what is your favorite meat to eat ?
<0> so many friends from my child hood have this same experience 
<0> oh wow, have you worked on any big campaigns?
<1> Zero, but hopefully I'll have some soon. 
<1> It was very disrespectful. People shouldn't have to worry about things like that happening to them in their own neighborhood.
<0> I love every single Stephen King novel, just choose one and go for it! Id recommend "it"
<0> Sure. I like thrillers that are not gross and bloody. How about you?
<0> Its very funny.  I also really enjoyed him in the Birdcage.
<0> Thank you. Can't afford outside help unfortunatley. Yes. I have picked up exercising though.
<0> eaters of lambs are monsters.
<1> It's fun. I mostly play with friends for "fun" but sometimes I play online for cash.
<1> yea they are subdivided into three superfamilies, the psittacoidea, the cacatuoidea and the strigoidea
<1> I live in the city. I'm sick of seeing the library every day.
<0> My favorite place to shop is Walmart!
<0> Apparently it is a rich city as well... might make it a bit expensive to live there though... guess living someplace clean and nice would cost a lot..
<1> you must have to be very organized to keep track of everyone then right ?
<0> Sometimes.  Unfortunately not as often as I would hope but you can't have everything.  He's still a good man.  I don't blame him since he has cognitive problems.  I love him anyway!
<0> So do I. I decided to become an engineer so I could help solve the world's problems.
<1> Oh wow have you ever seen a tiger in the wild?
<0> Yeah, I'm not too worried about it. I have a trustfund to live off of.
<0> Well how about where the word kiss came from. It is from Old English cyssan
<1> Funny.  Do you like fishing? I like to be outdoors and hike and fish.
<1> harvard . it is very elite .
<1> I work in an IT firm and I always feel burned out at the end of the day and don't have time for music.

<0> I don't get scared by storms. I like all of them.
<1> that's great . i just got back with mine . he's a lab . whats yours ?
<1> That's a lot. I could never ride a horse.

<1> I don't like kids, i prefer to be alone
<0> How do you eat your burgers? do 
<1> Didn't you say you went to a blind date before? You then seemed like you never been on one.
<0> That's interesting. I already knew Japan was made up of many different islands.
<0> i love that decade it had great music
<0> yeah that is understandable . what do you do ?
<0> Are there different types of train ?
<0> sounds yummy ! when i am not in school , i've a summer job .
<0> That is cool - I have seen wave pools in water parks
<0> I'm not much on animals...never owned one myself. I figure TV could go a long way towards occupying the kids.
<1> I'll have to watch it! I've never seen it before.
<0> I feel bad because I never go to church, I know I should
<1> work in the children section of the library .
<0> Yeah. Too bad I hate chocolate.
<0> yeah, what hobbies do you have?
<0> It should also be noted that some people think that Halloween began solely as a Christian holiday.
<0> I did. but it was cold out so I just drove by. I wonder if some of my old friends parents still live around there. That was a good time. Being young and playing with friends.
<1> I prefer night flying as well.  I love how you can see the city lights moving,  like it's the lifeblood of a living thing.
<0> I don't have idea of publishing
<1> Video games? How childish. I prefer to read.
<0> Learnig spanish makes me anxious and restless.
<0> That's pretty interesting. Well, candles are definitely something I enjoy in my home!
<0> Nice. Do you catch a lot?
<0> Yeah - not as scary as you'd think. It was only branches tapping in teh wind.
<1> Typos happen to the best of us right! Im glad the summer was atleast nice for them and that the bad people left! 
<0> No, she knew that we were dating and still decided to date him even though it's wrong.
<0> i still own it! i love the poker tables.
<0> I actually don't have any kids, how about you?
<1> My parents are celebrating their 30th wedding anniversary next month! I hope my marriage is as long and happy as theirs has been.
<0> Yes unlike now in 2016 there was 28 sports, and five more are going to be added in 2020
<1> That is so uncool. Sounds boring.
<0> cool , i love to read . have a favorite book ?
<1> That would be a short, boring video.
<0> Mine was a 1992 - Japanese import. I loved it but it was a nightmare to find parts for
<0> No I don't feel mentally active right now, but I do feel physically active
<1> Yeah, there's no way you'd be able to afford the shoes 
<0> Because she thinks it is a great sport, and she loves to play it
<1> TVs are too expensive to rent in the hospital, most people just use a tablet on the free wifi.
<0> I sure didn't do it on my own...well I did but if I was raised horribly I know I wouldn't be the man I am today.
<0> I really wish I knew how to swim, but I've been terrified of water since I was a child.  I cannot go anywhere near the lake.
<0> yeah the exploding ones left cool black marks on my wall though
<1> Yes I know after five-album deals with RCA and Rough Trade, they continued to release new music through Casablancas Cult Records
<1> Indeed thats among the most cherished item i would proudly display next to my other trophies. 
<0> There has been some discussion of female led pastors; some heated discussions at that.  There are some co-pastors, and deaconesses.  And I believe there may be a couple of female pastors.  The denomination has shifted substantially both regionally and historically since the 1940s.  
<0> Not much, I don't really like music so I spend my time playing videogames.
<1> You won't miss him at all, likely.
<0> That is some good advice, and one I try to follow.  Usually just makes it worse the next day.
<0> i win that . my parents are both in their 80s
<1> You should be ashamed to let it out and say you felt good.
<0> Yes, infidelity is on the rise, that's why I got a divorce!
<0> That's true.. I guess I hadn't thought of that. I kind of just framed it as,  "Aren't I good enough? Then your search should be over!" But it would be dumb not to explore all options available. But this waiting is rough...
<0> Free tickets! lol
<0> Weirdly enough I have also heard This earlier use of "fair" survives in the proper name Fairfax
<0> wonder woman. We still need to get costumes for ourselves though. What will you wear?
<0> i am done
<1> Neither do I.
<0> Yea and I am so jealous that he drives around in it so recklessly! 
<1> I agree, I just wish someone in my family had a switch I could borrow.
<1> I've never been there. I have spent all of my time living in the Northeast.
<1> It doesn't matter anyway.  No one cares about cooking.
<0> i do ! that is awesome . i love that !
<0> You should have a read. I love him.
<0> it does make learning the guitar a litle hard but i love jimi hendrix
<0> Thank you. I studied quite hard and think that I will do well,  regardless of what questions are on it.
<0> I love DC's low crime rate and the ease of the commute by car. 
<0> Sometimes I donate clothes, furniture, and household items. You can get a tax deduction.
<1> Are you a vegan?
<0> Let me know if you have any help
<0> Thanks alot for enlightening me about Ketogenic diet
<0> i broke my nose when i was ten
<1> Oh dam, sorry to hear. Hopefully he recovers quickly. 
<1> It's a great song. What about books? What's your favorite book?
<0> smiles, i really do love the breed
<0> My sister has some food that I am planning to eat after this conversation.
<0> Oh that sounds like fun too, I would use netflix more but i go to the movies like every week.
<1> I do not see hiking as a big thing in the land under. there are little or no land to roam
<0> that pay is good enough for the work, u drive around and get payed 
<0> No - he pulled a knife on me. But right at the same moment a policeman came round the corner
<1> I am so jealous! I hope you pack lots of sunscreen.
<0> She wore white dresses like a ghost and refused to leave her bedroom.
<0> Give me a chihuahua or jack russell instead. I'm not a fan of anything over 15 pounds.
<1> Well. Things change. I am glad she moved. Now you can do whatever you like to do in your home. 
<0> I am more of a burger and steak kind of guy because Italian food taste nasty to me. 
<0> I think the most disgusting one I've ever heard of is carried by our local grocery: crab rangoon pizza.
<0> so sorry to hear . but it is a beautiful time to enjoy other things as well .
<1> Exactly, having many kids gives you pleasure and hope without any issue. Sometimes i feel bored seeing kids growing well.
<0> I feel like I know more about this then you.
<0> Well we don't ever really fight over dumb things. And we also fight rarely. we are over the worst fights lol.
<1> Yeah,  I would have said the same things. Aren't they supposed to wear hair nets anyway? Thats's not acceptable.
<0> yes i do freelance every now and then such as data entry , etc
<1> That is sad.
<0> I do not like pizza at all
<1> I find the whole situation very amusing. Your cat is going to hell.
<1> Neither do i
<1> Me too. I prefer rainy days and hot coffee 
<1> Are you enjoying your college experience?
<1> Lets hope so. You may be surprised as well. 
<1> Oh yes, I do, but I have to be careful because I am allergic to white chili.
<0> Yes Hotel California is one of the best selling albums of all time. 
<0> I prefer coffee too since i don't like tea
<1> My dad gave me his Thor comic, it was his most prized possession.
<0> Lol Funny little things.
<0> thats cool. I dont like poetry and writing that much, its boring at times.
<0> That's great. I am never able to sing. 
<1> That's awesome.  I have a lot of family in the Navy.  I'm kind of the only one in the family that didn't go into the service.
<0> Test childresn ? ive never done anything with my life to be honest.
<1> I know what you mean, I love driving my truck around and scaring the small cars!
<1> Listening to music and playing board games. Like cavemen. Lol
<0> Yeah, THe obly time i ever really complained to her was when she made me take piano lessons.  
<1> Yes, he might not survive the flu. Just start preparing for his funeral
<1> Any other kind of foods other then vegetables?
<0> That might be true, but i don't like being outside. 
<0> I'll listen to her or music like that in general, soft music like that is great no matter your mood.
<0> Well,  my girls went on a mission trip this summer and the house was way too quiet during the day,  it was too much alone time I think.
<1> I understand that completely with the kids and I am a terrible artist. I usually just spend some extra time in the garden, do you have one? 
<0> Which other electric cars do you know?
<1> Not really, I don't even know in what city it's located.
<0> she is, but more importantly i am proud of her for standing strong during such a tough time
<0> Yeah,  I thought maybe it was Dumbledore but when I got home and turned around it was gone. I later saw it eating some mice in the yard.
<0> yup i remember it! im a fan of it. i actually thought her and lady gaga werethe same becase they came out at the same time lol.  what a pure time 10 years ago was
<0> I eat at raykies all the time. They are very clean and safe.
<1> I don't even love that game that much. I would not purchase it when it comes out.
<1> Can you make new friends where you are now?
<0> Wow that's amazing. I might ask my mom about it because she is a biologist.
<1> Yeah, I always loved America's Team -- the Cowboys.
<1> Yes, she was working really hard in this supermarket as a cashier but still could create time to read to me.
<0> My car is green, makes it harder to see. Yes, Marduk is rock

<1> Kentucky.  I have two brothers who live in Colorado, so we hardly ever see each other.
<1> Oh nice! Do you like to use oil? or acrylics?
<0> Italian is good. I just find myself putting something hot in most foods. 
<1> You are not alone 
<1> There are quite a few if you search it up and most of them are extremely cheap.
<0> I hate Bob Ross paintings
<1> I think that nature is better than watching sci fi movies like Star trek, not for me honestly.
<1>  I love music, but hate reading. 
<1> That's really dumb to be valedictorian.
<0> I love rock music! Do you enjoy your job?
<1> It still bothers me quite a bit. I re-injured it while swimming in the pool.
<1> I need some food,  any suggestions?
<1> Yes painting while listening to anything besides rock music is very relaxing.
<1> i am going to be the crazy cat lady . i already have 4 hahas
<1> A few days a week but it gets me out of the office so I don't have to see my colleagues.
<0> Yes he was very good on their eight albumn
<1> I have great imagination and creativity. I even like to create piano pieces to play.
<1> I wish I could help. The only things I know about raising a kid I learned from sesame street!
<0> Maybe! He works 2nd shift so he's not home much but he's a slob. He likes for me to cook. I charge him to wash his clothes.
<0> Yeah,  I think so. I am really not sure,  since he hasn't been to a vet in a while. I may go get a new one in a bit.
<1> Did you want something else? I love gummy worms.
<1> i've my degree in law , but i'm looking for a job now
<0> Yes, I even had a great day today.
<1> If you get a divorce, you can find a younger one.
<1> I hope so, because the rest of your lunch sucks.
<0> Yeah I saw the parade while I walked home last night. The streets were so crowded.
<1> Well it can be but luckily my insurance approved it
<1> you probably didn't have fun seeing it's a mystery. I hope you didnt.
<1> I am sorry about your car trouble,  good luck with that.
<1> Well that's good to hear, now you can take the course again.
<0> It might be, but I am not really interested in this. I have never looked at the stars as far as I remember.
<1> I still eat meat, I have a friend I can recommend though.
<0> i cant disclose that 
<1> what who says ? you sound like you got more issues than me man .
<0> I like to watch things. I just hate reading. It is a waste of time

<0> I'm looking for a house in the right neighborhood.
<0> I love cheesecake,  I should do that as well.
<0> my huge fingers are sausages
<0> It's always a surprise haha. I call the poop le shrimp because it curves like a shrimp scallop scampi. Oh baby!
<0> I would love to do that, there is a great steak place near me we could go to dinner at. 
<1> DO you enjoy it? It sounds nice
<1> You must be feel a bit guilty,  but thats okay
<0> That was what I heard. The only thing good on them is mustard.
<1> I should come to your home oneday.
<1> do you have pets or hobbies ?
<0> My life is terrible right now and there is nothing that I can do to change it.
<0> that is cool . i am retired . used to be a newspaper reporter .
<1> Sounds great! What's your fave movie?
<0> I'm too poor to do either,  so I'll just have to keep suffering along.
<1> i would rather eat dog biscuits than meet your brother .
<1> That's okay. I'd rather work in in a cheesecake factory. Cheesecake is my favorite food.
<1> Yes, you can say it whole heartedly, the way I say my liking about tea.
<0> Christpoher Columbus was born in 1506 and was an Italian explorer.
<0> It doesn't seem like the kind of drink that would even need to be invented, it is so common sense, but I guess it had to start somewhere.  Some guy in Cuba said, "Hey I have a coca-Cola, and some Bacardi, I wonder if it would be good together" and bam it was!
<0> I'm not married yet, I don't have any kids.
<0> The giant armadillos get huge, but the Pink Fairy variety are covered in silky yellowish fur. Cute!
<0> Yes she is. And very,  very un-potty trained. I have some major work to do with her
<0> Aw that's awful,  I wouldn't wish that on anybody. She was laughing and all smiley and everything,  I can't imagine why she ghosted me.
<0> My favorite food is Chinese. How about you?
<0> He was a good dad
<0> My job is really flexible. Sadly, that flexibility comes with getting paid pretty poorly these days.
<0> I made some noodles and spaghetti sauces
<0> Thank you! Till death do them apart, they will surely continue loving each other
<1> That is a very noble that you have taken. I wish you successful career with full of joy
<0> I fully support child modeling. 
<1> I don't really like fruits either
<0> Sometimes. Why don't you want to work? My work allows me to help people and additionally to have nice things like a vacation home in the mountains.
<1> I enjoy canning meat and whittling. Whittling and carving are similar.
<1> are you able to work without your glasses, I'm not comfortable doing that 
<0> Well I prefer to call and talk personally instead of sending a text message.
<0> i'm sure you and your husband are thrilled !
<1> Wow, that's a big change. In your place I'd probably stick to what I'm used to.
<0> It is.  Cleaning up their shedding is really fun!
<0> generally i do,  gotta be careful with all the crazies out there though
<0> i love cocolate so much that i cant do without it in a day
<1> You won't succeed.
<0> Honestly its just that work is smooth and no issues with home life or family right now. Life is seldom smooth so I am relaxed and enjoying it while it lasts.
<0> I scour the sales ads for the early specials and then make my list accordingly. 
<0> That's great, happy to hear.  I live on a pretty busy street with a lot of strays, so she stays inside!
<0> Yeah, I have two little ones at home.  I'm unemployed, so I have a lot of time to spend with them!
<0> I don't like collies, I think they are a useless breed 
<1> Yes, it was so exciting to be part of the whole thing.
<1> You're tempting me real bad! 
<1> People will remember the bags but they probably won't remember Chanel herself. 
<1> so you grow your own potatoes
<0> no no i can type with two hand. and even i cannot type very fast.
<1> that's a good show , i also have three thumbs on my right hand !
<1> We all have to believe them scientifically .What is your favorite season ?I love winter season due to the snow
<0> sorry about that . do you want more animals ? more kids ?
<0> How would I know? They are such ugly animals, anyway, so who cares?
<1> I would hate that, hearing my dog's breathing at night would be like a horror movie. I really hate horror movies!
<0> That is true
<0> Actually, I have 4 family tattoos. I am a pediatrician, and I use the tattoos to start conversations with my pediatric patients.
<0> Thanks, I am training to be the hulk at this point lol. 100 is a lot as well. Keep up the good work!
<0> No! When we got up we seen these large weird footprints like nothing we've seen before. I was speechless. 
<1> Ya, I have a job as a software engineer
<1> I get no pleasure from being on top of things. 
<1> my dog recently died and i am feeling the void .
<0> oh cool! I really miss winter; it doesn't exist in Texas. I used to drink hot chocolate and play in the snow. 
<0> hmmm i actually have started to like snakes a lot. in fact, i love snakes.
<1> I hate rock I like pop music. 
<1> only if i put my heart into it
<1> I don't know. I have watched all 12 seasons already. I don't like the stinginess of the coupons. It just discourages me from using coupons.
<1> No I wold never go to a KISS concert. I hate KISS and concerts give me headaches. The music is too loud.
<0> awesome , i wondered if you could relate to 4 9 ! love the lake .
<1> my favorite color is green luv green . 
<1> Yes, but it gets boring, it's very limited as to how to prepare them
<1> Do you also hunt? I miss being able to go elk hunting
<1> I'm very healthy, don't like candies, it upsets my stomach.
<0> That would be fun but not very practical.  Maybe we should make a company that is a party.
<1> Yes, that's where I currently live.
<0> The thought of venice that I had is not good at all and don't want to go there.
<0> yea and he got a free t shirt

<1> That sounds fun. I live in the city and wish I had space for a garden.
<0> I have so much going them to them
<1> Me too, I really dislike when things are neat and in their place. It's unnatural.

<0> i have a volkswagon passat , love the moonroof .
<0> i don't remember . the cashier said it was jason bleeder or something like that

<1> i will serve sushi for dinner , it is my favorite thing to eat
<1> She is very dependable, you have nothing to worry about.  
<1> I always forget how much I need them till I'm away from them for a while.
<0> I am done with my studies and i like to continue work in a hotel. 
<0> yes but i really hate sushi and tofu. i rather eat rice because am allergic to sea food and soy beans 
<1> I'm glad you got away. Did you make your flight on time?
<1> I really don't like to read, I just like to write poetry. 
<0> Yeah, I feel bad for those people that can't enjoy a nice peanut butter sandwich. Fortunately for me, I am completely free of allergies, woo-hoo!
<1> I am the youngest of my siblings but no one cooks for me
<1> i suppose that's true . i am not that into sports . i just 19 . . .
<0> Yes! Do you have a favorite brand of pancakes?

<0> Oh you teach at law school? I loved law school. 
<0> Sounds like it, I wanna go there sometime.
<0> They are great. I love pink, the singer.
<0> Nope! But I am having all my friends over. Can't wait to see the cool gifts they got me!
<0> Yeah that is why I hate to go to France and not a big fan of that country.
<0> That is true. They are very tasty with cheese
<1> i don't really know i'm new . but this one is cool to me
<1> I do not think you put in a lot of work
<1> nope ! it is pink ha ha nice try pal .
<1> do you not think it will affect you other plans?
<0> That's so cool, we have the exact same name!
<0> I don't know. This is my first year.
<0> i won't take it.
<0> Every animal definitely has a different personality.  The dog is a guardian and friend and peace maker. The cats generally yes
<1> Well I know a local pizzeria restaurant near me does sweet chocolate pizza but its definitely not for me.  My friend gets chicken and pineapple and she is forever getting told off for putting fruit on a pizza!!
<0> he is not , just trying out now . i just go to university at nyu .
<0> No, I just went swimming with my friends at the same beach the following weekend without him.
<1> wow ! that is really neat ! whats your best photo ?
<0> Most of them do.  Although I love my truck and it has lasted forever too. 
<1> Yes, the mountains are amazing and keep us cold and cozy. 
<1> I don't really think it's that tough though.
<1> No you won't
<0> That's lucky. I'm at the gym 7 days a week but never meet anyone quite that interesting
<1> I've never heard either song, I'll check them both out tonight.
<0> What age bracket can get special education?
<1> It is when you're feeling good but lately I haven't felt well and so haven't been doing much.
<0> It certainly does, I never would have expected my son to grasp the piano as quickly as he has.
<0> I'm the only child.  I have no brothers and sisters.
<0> I don't have any tattoos either. 
<0> We don't want to start a family anytime soon and jazz would never work as a lullaby. 
<0> I want to make and release a video on our universe before the the Big Bang.That's my life ambition.
<0> Thanks, I'm really trying to lower the amount of energy I use everyday. I still have room for improvement though, I need to replace my Ford with something more environmentally friendly.
<0> did i say beer , lol
<0> I think I am going to break up with my girlfriend, I don't want a baby right now!
<0> Haha, such a good question. They actually have black skin under their coats. So what do you like to do?
<1> She won't, she's always running around after things - cats, mostly!
<0> They are great! Have been around for a very long time and I've bought from them since I was a teenager.
<1> No schooling is required for that job.
<1> My hair is blue by the way. I like rock music 
<0> Yes,  he really likes to paint now so he made sure to use all of his favorite colors.
<0> i'm a call of duty girl i cant wait for the new one
<0> I never studied in uni, why you are asking about research?
<0> I don't really like listening to it, just playing instruments. 
<0> I bet that is super healthy. Corn syrup is not good at all. I'm egg-free, gluten-free pescatarian.
<1> I do not play any instruments.
<0> it really hurts me
<1> Sorry, I just wanted to change the subject. Swimming is kind of boring. 
<0> I kind of like the sound.  But that is a good point, I don't like heavy metal all that much.  I'm more of a classical type for my favorites.
<0> This is true. I know an 82-year-old woman who loves to play Pickleball. How old do you think the sport of tennis is?
<0> I know right!? I love games! Play them all the time!
<0> I and my wife would like to go on walks
<0> I am 17 it's been 10 years since I was 7.
<0> never heard of that . i only listen to rap . the street life chose me .
<0> i am blue . and i swim . i work on the sea . what am i
<0> thats one of the first places im going with my friend from college
<1> Oh, you know what, I'm actually not great with young kids, to be honest. Thanks anyway!
<0> That would be fun! I've never been there before. I did just go to the one in New Orleans though. It was amazing!
<1> No, I can't stand computers, was never good at using them.
<0> I will be back
<1> I do not like going with friends
<0> Thank you,  what are you studying
<1> I would be too.  I'm happy you didnt get into an accident or even worse, killed!
<1> That sounds boring, but I'm only 12. 
<0> Oh yes ! I fell and scraped my knees,  let our a very LOUD yell,  and instantly called for my MOTHER !
<0> I'm going to speak on sports!
<0> I need to try yoga, I am not doing so great right now.
<0> Just stay away from any snacks made with seaweed.  A lot are over-processed, full of sodium and taste bad. 
<0> Oh cool! You live in Texas. It must be very hot there still.
<0> oh okay ! i've heard of that show ! i am a huge fan of animal planet .
<0> oh , silly me . i lost track of the days . tends to happen when you are retired !
<0> I don't like anything but chocolate chips added to mine.
<1> Lemon tea is good for our health.
<0> I cry everynight before I go to sleep
<0> I love the color cyan which is one of the major colors in color printing
<1> Oh well then perhaps you shouldn't have gone there 
<1> yeah, i don't think we ever hung out with beauty peagents
<0> No need to have one, nobody has yet broken into my house
<0> I think there are enough people to keep it moving who have a love for the art of photography, I do not think it is going anywhere 
<1> Purple is calming.  Blue and green make purple and they are both calming colors.
<1> Stop worrying, it sounds easy. 
<1> I know, I'm at a picnic in the pak right now and it is beautiful.
<1> Oh, it is not normal to feel that way. You need to be confident at your new job.
<0> I hate the gym and avoid it.
<1> That doesn't seem so bad to me. Get over it.
<1> I hate when my boss makes us give free food to the bands that play, it comes out of my tips.
<0> oh like 2
<0> Ok. I think that could fit for a Alzheimer event I want to do. I'll be in contact soon. Enjoy the board games 
<1> he walked away 
<0> Well I have always been interested in law, but I like the federal system because the cases are more interesting to me
<1> I don't know about that.  I know that Jordan and Willis both got divorced.  I don't know abput Stathem though.
<0> Due to changing customers diets they started adding salads, fish, fruit and smoothies to stay relevant
<0> I have never traveled outside of Texas.
<0> i think the whole thing about the creatures are boring and stupid
<0> New York City is a small city in america
<1> I should! The last time I was there I went to this great ice cream parlor! 
<1> i have many brothers and sisters 
<1> ready ? oop , here you go ! tell me , is it as good as it smells ?
<0> I got over it but I'm sad about my mug... he owes me one
<1> I like it because it reminds me of my wedding in Cancun -- all those great spicy dishes with chile peppers.
<1> That all sounds like it was so exciting!
<1> Yeah.
<0> Thanks. We want to get her seen by a professional but we can't find anyone for her to see.
<0> I figure I deserve some couch time since I watch what I eat and only eat healthy foods.
<1> any way need a bed to sleep
<0> That is a great one.  I love the message of that movie.
<0> Me to but aparently not!
<0> Me too. I hate Disney movies, I find them childish

<1> A lot of kids these days are addicted to technology. Does she listen to you often?
<0> i hardly have any , how about you ?
<1> I body surf in the nearby ocean and play volleyball. How about you?
<0> No, my dad was allergic so we never had any pets.
<0> wow! so interesting and how did the come to Europe and America? 
<0> No, it's not so convenient for me. I'd just watch videos on youtube.

<1> Wherever I can find land. I have been to many different places. 
<0> Oh my that seems pretty deadly, I heard they also have great speed and are masters of the hunt.

<1> He should be happy that she was willing to stay with him without getting married.  
<0> That's cool. I wish I had pets. I don't have any though.
<0> So they actually had people in the military that would dodge work. 
<0> They had pop love songs down to an art.  They're pretty good. 
<0> Well it's hard not to be a little rough. Branding, whipping etc. could be construed as inflicting harm to the animal. Is it cruel? I don't know.
<0> First i would have taken care of my parents,  they deserve it
<0> Yeah, vegetarians are crazy!
<0> That's good to know, although my repetitive thoughts don't really bother me too much so it's no big deal anyway.
<1> i love all sorts of cars , so i just travel the us living in cars
<0> I am a freelancer and have no office.
<1> Stop calling me that ! Bubblegum sounds too silly to be a name.  
<1> Annulment is when people declare a marriage void in a religious context. Divorce is a legal separation. I think Americans have the lowest divorce rate and the highest annulment rate.

<1> well, if possible low cost foods and plans to get my food
<0> Women in the 1950's were notoriously frightened of mice you see. There were spin offs in the 1970s like 'The Tom and Jerry Show' but I think these weren't a hit like the old ones!
<0> i work for the national guard in my free time .
<0> I am okay but I was terrified,  I thought we were going to collide and I was worried about getting hurt!
<1> I am very outgoing and happy.
<0> It is worth the while. With the technological advancements in New York City I tend to believe it is worth.
<1> that's true what do you like to eat
<0> I haven't been given a treatment option. I wonder how doctors typically treat it.

<1> Oh right so like ten pin bowling? that would be great for my son as he doesn't like going outside much.
<0> You just have to embrace it.  Who is your favorite author?
<1> not really. i just sit around in front of a computer editing videos
<1> Being in Dallas, are you a Cowboys fan?
<0> Probably not, it's a rather mature movie, but for adults it is a great American crime film!
<0> Yes, sometimes it looks everything's fine, but you don't realize what all pain one's going through.
<1>  I like to create things that inspires people. That is why I chose to do my artwork on various kinds of materials, such as cardboard and canvas.
<0> There will be no spin offs at all, which is a good thing because I found the story in that show boring.
<0> I don't really want to improve though, I hate singing.

<0> That is old! I did not know that either.
<0> I've always lived in Kansas so I've never seen the ocean.

<0> That is so true.  When the husband is the sole provider his death can leave his family destitute
<1> I try not to think to much about kitchen sanitation when I go out to eat.

<0> You are a bit dull, you are just like everyone else I know.

<1> I suppose so. I've never gravitated towards them. They seem like they only have one personality,  and they're either nice or mean,  and never warm up to you over time. So,  I was a little wary of that.

<0> That is interesting, there are so many countries that do so many things differently, to have the rules be the same across all places is crazy
<0> yes I made lasagna with meat in the sauce
<1> Okay because i am an accountant and maybe i can help you out.
<1> i really do not like pizzas too so i guess i be a veggie
<0> Yeah,  I just don't have the energy I need to do things I want to. 
<0> Wow oh wow was a popular irish duo in the early 10s
<0> It was in math,  I got an 95%.
<1> Oh that sounds difficult, I could never do it- I love carbs way too much.
<0> I find history boring. I'd much rather watch comedies.
<1> Me too, it's boring being single.
<1> Angelina Jolie is my favourite. Voila Davis too
<0> I've only watched a bit of anime. What's your favorite? I only play on the weekends with friends. We have a lot of fun though. 
<0> Yeah that's why my moped is painted Blue and Gold, the colors of the Swedish flag.
<1> I don't need to lose weight because I am really skinny.
<1> That is really neat. I hope to be a mom one day.
<1> That's not true, age is just a number, I can get any job I want!
<1> Sorry, I have nothing ready yet.
<0> Do you do any crafts? 
<0> :) i think its important to relax to who you are.  If you are trying, making progress, its all good stuff.
<0> I think the sales tax was around 7%, about like normal. I don't know whether there were any special taxes on beer and the like.
<0> I think the roller coasters are my favorite thing.
<0> I have a cat scratch past as well,  but he really liked the smell of the leather.  I should have known he was going to do that.
<1> I hate comedy show.
<1> Well you haven't been together that long. 
<1> You shouldn't
<0> Well if you were insanely fat and overweight you could even get liposuction.
<0> yes and to answer your question earlier I am part of the layout crew
<1> i love them ! i've a pet lizard named bobo .
<0> Yes,  he was such a loving animal. He was a great friend.
<1> Omg, that would be the best!
<1> I can only wish. My sister tends to get first dibs on most things.
<1> sounds like she is ready to succeed 
<1> me too ! i love cooking for lots of people .
<1> Yeah, I'm always careful about that. I always drink plenty of milk as well.
<1> hmm do not know . i write romantic novels under a pen name .
<1> But you can get used to that,you must loose many times for you to gain,for me am just used to that I  cannot feel any pain at all.
<0> I disagree. I never liked them and don't think they contributed to much.
<0> watermelon can be tiring 
<0> We did not,  instead we had to park very far away and walk the rest for the first entire day. Eventually the people came back and moved the cars in the middle of the first night so we had to sacrifice more time the next day to retrieve our car.
<0> Me too, that's why I sculpt statues in my free time instead.
<0> How long has the show been running?
<0> no , just something i would like to try . i will one day .
<1> Not so good. I am very nervous.
<1> that's alright, i was pressured by family to enlist but i decided to be a nurse instead
<1> i want to eat a grasshopper
<1> I'm relieved to hear he is doing well.
<0> It was a full grown banana tree.  Before that he was kicking steel street sign posts and bending them out of shape...then he moved onto the banana tree and cut through it like butter!
<0> expensive vintage cars and more. But, i don't wish for a large mansion type house like theirs.
<0> Oh definitely! They have some academy award winning makeup artists on there too, like Ve Neill for example!
<1> I was very excited to watch.
<1> I love to be basketball player
<1> I'm glad your fish died. 
<0>  If I pass, sure. But I don't know, the test was really hard. I'm not sure how I did.
<0> Yea performances developed a lot of 50 years and animals were indeed abused sadly.
<0> We are going to Rocky Mountains, probably going to drive all the way in our black car.
<0> They can be snippy like most small dogs so not with toddlers. Strange since they are the 4th most popular dog in the USA
<0> Sometimes we go to the park but we really like to go swimming at the beach.
<1> I work in a private organisation and i am paid on weekly bases . Do you work under a company also ?
<0> I'll make a plan to do that. I actually look down on people who don't eat out as often as I do, but I'm thinking I need to reevaluate that.
<0> My brother died earlier in a car wreck.
<0> I haven't but grew up baking, it was a major family tradition. Some of the recipes for cake we used were centuries old
<0> I really like reality TV shows like The Masked Singer.
<0> true that ! i would rather lay in the pool to relax instead of reading a book
<0> I would but i hate math.
<1> Are you a fan of Imagine Dragons? Radioactive is my favorite song off the Night Visions record.
<1> And the Animals, haven't thought of them in YEARS either!
<0> Well jazz is a very important part of jazz since it began
<0> Sustained, powered flight no less. The Wright Brothers had flown gliders for years prior.
<0> I like blue as well, very relaxing color.
<0> Yes, it helps to keep the pace going. Of course running wasn't always used for pleasure and it is believed our ancestors ran long distances to hunt animals.
<0> Actually I would save the money for my family.
<0> I don't know, I put all my heart and soul into this.
<1> yeah i am . what do you do ?
<0> I wouldn't know much about pets. I do not have any.
<0> Pita, also known as Arabic bread, Lebanese bread, or Syrian bread
<1> I really think Texas isn't worth visiting, there is a lot of racism there.
<0> That might be possible. However the first instance of rowing as a competitive sport goes back to the 10th century in the United Kingdom.
<0> yeah it said it was out for delivery but still it upsets me
<1> sounds like a great gig you have there .
<1> country music is the worst, i love meatloaf like a bat outta hell!
<0> Our experiences shape and form who we really are as we go through life.
<1> it's the 2016 benz c300.
<0> Thanks! I can't wait to see it filled with people who are passionate about the iron! I'll probably take on a little personal training while I'm at it.
<0> Meh, I honestly dont care much for dogs. I prefer cats personally
<1> BUT IF IM IN YOU POSITION I WONT LAUGH
<0> Cool! I wonder how he came up with the drink?
<0> junk food is my favorite and i have no kids so i can eat all the junk i want 
<0> I don't quite stay awake until dawn, but close to it!  The sun is just peeking over the horizon when I go to bed!
<1> Well it's good that you know how to protect yourself? Would you like to hunt with me?
<0> I Love shouting colors like pink,orange and red they make a car very unique and attractive.
<1> I don't think you should talk to her parents they will probably just shew you away.
<0> I wouldn't have enjoyed that. I hate Italy.
<1> portland 
<1> She will be fine.
<0> He did better than me.
<0> It is.  I love to see young kids showing love.
<1> zombies are the greatest and are super nice 
<1> Yoga is low impact. They have classes for all ages and levels. It will be a reason to get up and help you stay healthy longer.
<0> sounds interesting 
<1> Well most partners don't like surprises, it's too shocking for most people to handle.
<0> you have to learn to bear with life situations for a time being .
<1> My house is big but it only has one bedroom, so I wouldn't be able to accommodate or take care of you.
<0> Perhaps so,  but I wish he would just be quiet and stop pestering me.
<0> I don't know how to fix things
<0> She cheated on me,  I am so sad over it.
<0> I love to care for cats but I hate dogs.
<0> I haven't heard any of their music before.
<0> my wife works at a school as a nurse . maybe she will need help
<0> Yes!  So what do you do for a living?
<0> i fix a cup of coffee in the morning a just lay back and doze off .
<0> i've never ridden a unicycle, it sounds hard
<0> amazing . do you have salad there ?
<0> It has always bothered me how same-y Italian food is. 
<0> yeah but who does not listen to bruno mars ? ; actually i prefer christian rock
<1> I don't like work much, I like to watch the clouds and think.
<0> Oh I never saw that, I am more of a bugs bunny person.
<0> That's cool. Does it tend to be hectic traveling there during the holidays?
<0> I'm not sure, I've never been to Livery Island before.
<0> What kind of work do paralegals do?
<1> Do not bother. I think she is treating you fairly.
<1> I just think you should just be optimistic and patient
<0> No, not at all. I don't like my colleagues anyway, so we wouldn't be going out for beers together.
<0> just hanging out with my fur babies also .
<0> No, i am not hungry.
<0> No! I am really good at gambling and it's my goal to gamble professionally.
<0> is that all they server ?
<0> I know! I feel the same way about lobsters and not to mention they actually look like cockroaches! lol
<1> Having a baby is so easy, the best part is that you can finally drink again
<0> a big ole truck ! no other way to ride . and you ?
<0> I know that there is a lot of green in Florida.
<0> I agree, I work at a gas station and I see the lottery junkies come in every day. I hate apples. 
<1> im sure youre in tip top shape.
<0> Oh, I'm the quintessential night person. I never go to bed before 3 am.
<0> I was born in Africa. Moved here when I was 14
<0> back in the states my wife makes bacon all the time .
<1> I don't like gummy worms either. They are too sweet for me.
<0> It is! I've had several come and go but I'm thankful for those who have stayed.
<1> No. I have never had any
<1> That's good. The city is hard to live in, and you have to walk every where.  
<1> i like sports and money
<1> I have a son. He's only 4 1/2 so we haven't fully been immersed in the world of kid's sports yet. He's starting basketball this year
<1> I am not a dog or cat fan. 
<1> That's great. I work as a nurse. Today I am off but tomorrow I have to work all day long
<1> I don't like such animals just give it a name. 
<0> Oh I bet Hawaii was beautiful. Did you develop a love for pineapples while you were there?
<0> yeah i actually notice that
<0> Quite good indeed. Until the end of the Middle Ages, kale was one of the most popular green vegetables in Europe.
<0> I'm a doctor, I love my job
<0> In accounts, I guess i have change my meds again.
<1> Yeah, but it's actually not an impossibility
<1> She's a terrible babysitter!
<1> I've only been teaching two years but I feel like I've done well by the kids I teach.
<0> i'm glad i made these cupcakes for myself!
<0> i have every coupon you could think of
<0> Wow, that is an unfathomable amount of money. I guess money didn't satisfy him enough though, he wanted the position as the most powerful man in the world!
<0> Yeah,  well my husband got a new job and it was too good to turn down!
<0> No, I'm not really into BBQ or smoked meat in general.
<1> That is not Ok at all.
<1> I can not say I read much 3 days out of 7 I will have a read, but not everyday and all the time, not obsessed with reading lol
<1> Well I think shopping online is a stupid idea.
<0> I tried to call her pretty and stumbled over my words.
<1> I would rather use a mouse trap because I can't stand cats.
<0> Exactly. Journalists take on that burden because they have no choice; they're only allowed to work on general issues.
<0> no , it is not . i have studied extensively on this subject .
<0> No it didn't! I hated every second of it!
<0> in a cable company i just said it a while ago .
<0> It's been a few years since I read it, but the middle book, The Two Towers, was my favorite. Reading The Hobbit first is probably your best bet, though. And it's a lot shorter to get through.
<1> It is pretty fancy 
<1> Oh, NO...I dont like playing instruments
<0> I am feeling pretty good about it since I think I am very well prepared.
<1> I hate things that are sweet
<0> In Thailand the soap operas are usually shown during prime time rather than during the day
<1> I haven't seen him yet.
<0> yes it is very nice
<0> I'm allergic to chicken
<1> Yea you need to stick with what you have now. 
<1> You must have bombed the interview you don't sound confident. 
<1> i play basketball on the weekends
<1> No, I only have plans to go to work this weekend and not do anything fun. 
<0> It's not that I'm lazy and not trying. I am. 
<1> I do surf in net but without wine and cooking  trying different dishes
<0> An important material to recycle includes plastic. We have high rates of plastic pollution.
<0> My husband walks around on Saturdays with earplugs in his ears.  
<1> My mom sometimes wishes she could be a dancer.
<1> I have been known to use my shirt a few times to blow my nose. Hey, when you don't have a tissue you don't have a choice. 
<1> that will come in handy , what do you want to do for work ?
<0> II dropped out in 9th grade. 
<1> do you have dog parks near you ? that's where i normally run to with them .
<0> It's definitely wonderful to try regional specialties -- and of course -- PIZZA!
<0> i do ! i love the new eye shadow i just bought .
<0> You are right.  Sometimes it is unavoidable.  It should be treated as an absolute last resort in my opinion though.
<0> thats where im from.
<1> fascinating!
<1> Back in my day I would have never exhorted money from other kids.
<1> Your welcome, I hope your dad takes care of you better.
<0> yep, Literacy references only go back to the old testament.
<0> It was supposed to be a hockey stick, but they have a weird sense of humor. 
<0> I hate pool in general however, drinking games are way more fun!
<0> The initial outlay can be expensive, a good sewing machine will set you back about $400 aus. But it is well worth it. I'd highly recommend giving it a go.
<0> Do you drink Iced sweet tea? I live in the south and that is the number one thing to drink around here. Also, processed foods are just so easy compared to doing it yourself.
<0> Thank you. I'm going to cook him some wings. I hope he's not disappointed.
<1> police eventually arrested him before anything major
<1> Then what else you heard about them apart from the above characters
<1> I don't have the time to do volunteer work since my job keeps me busy. 
<1> I have already adopted 3 pets before. The more the better!
<1> Really? I hate the bass so I don't really understand
<1> How many countries do they have their exclusive boutiques in ?
<0> It's my favorite show too!
<1> So what do you do in the summer?
<0> I wonder since I do not have kids
<1> definitely . i'm so tired though .
<0> My  two  sister and  my  parents  .  
<0> yea they are with grandma .. they are good
<0> I'm not really that excited about it since I know they'll want something in return.
<0> This was around 1400. France ended this practice of barbers being dentists.
<0> I have studied and know the material.
<0> Wow must be great having children. How are they?
<1> I guess I don't mind. It means someone was thinking of me, at least.
<0> no camping , my family bad, i hate them
<1> Wow, I'm surprised it still bothers you. Most people are diligent drivers so you shouldn't have to be that scared.
<1> I'm sorry to cut you off. This sounds like a long story and i don't have time. I must go now. 
<0> stocking an art department ,  and carry out furniture for customers 
<1> Me too, I don't like metal music I like something soft and slow to listen to
<0> Yeah they have always been like that .  This influence has given them the name a man's best friend. 
<1> That is the best thing to have in life. Not much else matters in my opinion.
<0> That's probably true. I was born into wealth and had everything handed to me with no struggles at all.
<0> I love the large population density because, All the peoples are willing to know each other.
<1> have books on avail
<0> that would be great . my day job is in marketing
<1> do you race with horses ? if i do , i would what to win . love winning .
<1> Yeah you shouldn't have, I hope it didn't end well for you.
<0> The population of the city of New Orleans proper was 343,829 in 2010
<0> I like the ocean best for fishing as well. 
<0> i already had it when i was 17 ,
<0> He died so young from an illness assumed to be influenza-related.  If we had flu shots back then, imagine what else he could have done!
<1> That does sound pretty good. I mean,  working from home is great,  but doing it on your own time is way better.
<1> she was ? has she passed ?
<0> Yes ,better pray for them & be safe
<0> I have too many jokes in my mind. Give me a second.
<1> Not me! Unless it is a meat substitute as I am a vegan
<0> probably so . my two sons might have some ideas .
<1> I really despise eating vegetables.
<1> What's hard about history? There's nothing to know or memorize.
<1> I don't like them because I like the Dallas Cowboys.
<1> I love to eat new york cuts the most
<0> After World War II Allied troops came home from Italy and brought pizza with them. It is now very popular across the USA.
<1> thats very annoying
<1> I live in a small coastal community in the northeast. The ocean is really nice.
<1> Just remember that the idea for snowboarding originally came from scuba diving so it's important to be able to hold your breath a long time.
<0> Guitar Center is the largest Company of its king, it has over 260 locations in the United States
<0> I bet, unfortunately I don't know too much about the movie. 
<1> yes i do. I read mostly on technologies
<0> perfect ! it sounds like fun . did you get your dress ?
<0> That is all you can do.  I teach school now, and try to help those kids i see in similar situations.
<1> I like my phone, its working pretty well.
<0> its nothing now i did 5 yrs but i am over it...lol
<0> Yeah, I don't think vegetarianism has any health benefits.
<0> Not yet, but I would love to ride one it would be my first time
<0> Yeah that's a great perk. I hate staying up past midnight.
<1> I don't care to travel because I would have to include all of children who are all boys.
<0> It's for health care company. It'll be a better job for him. Thank you.
<0> Yea but I got really red faced and embarrassed.
<1> Dance is a dumb sport, my kids would never be in dance.
<1> A lot of people are, I'm not afraid of anything though.
<0> They bring back so many memories.
<1> I wish the weather was nicer so i can go out and do fun things. 
<1> I've been sad lately.
<1> yoga is great for the body and mind . it helps me with my current role .
<1> ok...any good burger joints around your town? 
<1> That is my daughters favorite pony too.
<0> oh , so you are bald ?
<0> I have not. I fix airplanes for a living though so I especially enjoy games where you make or fix things.
<1> I never use acrylic paints, so I wouldn't know.
<1> lol, right! We live in Canada and they only listen to French music..
<0> I don't know what to do. It's so quiet here and nothing to do.
<0> yes, it rains quite often in belmont
<1> that sounds fun . i am a stay at home girlfriend . my boyfriend is a nasa engineer
<0> I don't care how good parents are. I grew up in orphanage.
<1> So you didn't have to catch up on much
<0> Eh not really. About the same amount of effort as ordering food for the dog. Just got to thaw them out a bit, then you got to dangle the mice over their tanks. They strike quick when they're hungry. 
<0> That's because there was never any female barbershop quartets.
<0> I hadn't considered the cross breeding!  That's very common these days.
<1> If you want it, only you can make it happen. It's not like God will help you.
<1> Of course, business owners could cut expenses to remain profitable.
<1> never tried them . i love the color though . perfect color for a kitchen back splash .
<0> She sounds like she is wonderful company!  Cats are so much fun.
<0> nice . never much for basketball myself .
<1> I traveled a lot after I finished college, I want to get back to traveling soon
<1> It's a shame it was so expensive.
<1> Do you prefer sedans, suv's, or trucks?
<1> No, I'm more into college football, NFL, NBA and i just started to get into Formula 1 after watching that documentary on Netflix
<1> That is the same robot I used in the cabin last month.
<0> Oh cool. Are you married?
<0> No!  I am scared of sharp objects.
<0> No I like my bank because they are not greedy at all like other banks. 
<0> i saw that cartoon
<1> what are you going to school for ?
<1> Thank you I will
<1> oh! lasagna. that's one food I don't like
<0> You'll be alright,  make sure to talk to your coworkers or you'll feel lonely like me!
<0> Sadly, she isn't. She passed away a few years ago.
<0> i love we wrestling and having my nails done .
<0> Memories are always nice to have
<0> would you kayak with me ? i go to a local lake
<1> No, I think it's time to get a new one.
<1> sure ! i know of this place that's right by my favorite comic book shop !
<0> We're going to the beach this weekend!!! WOOOOT!
<1> I've seen funnels touch down a couple times but they never came close.
<1> I'm great! I have just been accepted into the college that I wanted!
<0> I'm lucky to have never provoked any dogs, I don't know what I'd do if one chased me.
<1> I make a snowman every year.
<0> It is banned here too which sucks because I love fishing. 
<1> Skills? Please. ANYONE can start a business. There's nothing special about it. 
<0> Indeed it is.
<1> He's about as tall as my forearm and weighs about 15 pounds. I have an African grey, which is one of the types of companion parrots.
<0> That would be great. I know you live close to me and you have kids.  Maybe we could trade my babysitting skills for your construction skills.
<0> do you like to play sports
<0> Me too, I'll be starting school pretty soon.
<0> I don't like skiing , I don't think I would find learning about their history interesting.
<0> Thats cool, I bet you fish all the time. I'm jealous, I love fishing
<0> oh that is awesome ! are you going to go somewhere ?
<1> I'm so glad you're into dogs. What about food. What do you like to eat?
<0> i do blue and pink , u ?
<1> I hope you didn't hurt yourself
<0> I just feel guilty. I should have eaten a peach.
<0> that's cool as hell. I know that he hangs with a lot of people that I used to know before I left for the Army
<1> Exactly!  That's why I've never liked any of the people I work with.
<1> I have seen them leave whole foods in movies. gross
<0> You should give it a try! Some cats actually end up liking it a lot, and you can have a running buddy.
<0> It was a fair price. and its 4 wheel drive.
<1> Though  I  always seem to be confident and strong even before drinks.
<1> You should forget about it and not tell any one about this incident.
<0> Yep. But, I just realized my subscription started in 2013.
<0> I'm not even interested in starting a company. There are so many risks involved
<1> Really?   We actually have a lot of rescue places in my town.  They do not take kindly to people abusing animals in my neck of the woods.
<1> Yes, it's not easy. It does feel rewarding though to serve others.
<1> Since I've never had kids my abs always look good.
<0> I like dancing but I despise the guitar.
<1> The actual term "marketing" came from the literal meaning of actually going to the market with goods for sale.
<0> Yeah. I just hate vanillas completely
<1> I like pineapple but not a fan of pizza. 
<0> Man, that is way back.  I guess a lot of people have found it useful over the years
<1> My daughter plays all the time at home.
<0> I'm glad I don't have any pets, they are a total pain!  
<1> i wish i was an animal , so i would not worry about eating too much fast food .
<0> I bet you both are great artists!  I have no artistic talent whatsoever.
<1> I read it on a blog. I would never go to a beauty salon, myself.
<1> personally I don't think it's ethical to eat the fish I catch, I always just throw them back.
<0> i don't eat pizza i am eat only seafood it is healthy for our body.
<1> Which national park were you going to visit? I'll probably drive my red car to the beach later
<0> ok i understand your situation don't feel it.
<0> how did you get a metal knee ? that sounds painful !
<1> I was wondering how I got this hypersensitivity of body sweat. Trying to figure out 
<1> i'm only 15 , so i think retail would be good for me
<0> Oh, I don't know that genre. I rarely play video games.
<0> I wish I could travel more but I'd rather stick to urban areas. I really dislike being in nature.
<0> dallas last month . museums are my favorite thing so travelling helps knock out a lot
<1> any good craft shows there ? i go on the weekends ?
<1> i actually lived in austin for two years . i was a plumber . made good money .
<1> I don't understand that at all honestly, cemeteries are such honorific places and I don't get a negative sense from them at all.
<0> Yeah I just wish it was cheaper. I think the cheapest ticket I ever paid for was $10. 
<1> Yeah.
<0> Yes and it helps me stay in shape along with my extremely healthy diet.
<1> there are plenty of them here . i do the same
<1> he was on the door
<1> No, it's totally blue.
<0> it's such a boring job so I'm looking for something new and exciting.
<1> It's great, do you swim much?
<1> I hate all sports.
<0> It's a partner position at a law firm!
<1> interesting . do you like candy ? i've a bad sweet tooth
<0> Sonia
<0> That is true! I did good work with them for what they cost, I think that you can create a masterpiece with anything if you put enough effort into it!
<0> You, know apples and oranges, but sometimes we just buy them in the rural areas. Anything that is not urban is considered rural.
<0> Haha that time I opted for a salad so I wouldn't have to worry! xD
<0> i spend time with my siblings . my mom was home all day raising us .
<1> Yeah.  I'm a really good photographer.
<0> It is a bit more of a tart taste to it, like a grapefruit tends to have. I guess that's why Florida Welcome Centers give orange and grapefruit juice to each visitor that goes there!
<0> I hope I get married first
<0> My wife and I once won a dance contest, but I think all the judges were drunk.
<1> because my blue and orange hair explains it all .
<1> Oh, I see. I do not blame you especially since you had tiring and demotivating tea
<1> cannot , i have arthritis everywhere ! i'm a young 77 year old lady !
<1> True and it is great to watch. Soccer is so exciting.
<0> Oh, unlucky for you. It's so sunny and red hot here.
<0> Yes, we always go bowling on Thanksgiving after the dinner.  One year I managed to bowl a 300 score game!
<0> Another good band is the Red Hot Chili Peppers, which was founded in 1983--quite a bit older than you!
<1> Well, I am not in college, so I can't help you with that. 
<1> I quit school years ago. 
<0> I didn't.  I grew up in a large city.
<1> Me too. I still drink some sodas because I love it

<1> Why are you mentioning about the number of years you are married ? Never asked about that 
<1> No, I'm not in engineering, I'm in the music business.
<0> It was, but I have irrational fears. For example I'm vegetarian now and I don't know how they'll take it.
<0> I really like salads, but everyone here hates the seafood!

<1> She will never forgive you for this then.
<1> I would hate to live in Spain, it's such a boring country.

<1> Sucks how customers blame employees like it's their fault
<0> Wow I'm jealous, wish I was good enough to be in a band.
<1> i have been able to accumulate some wealth here in japan .
<1> I cannot stand either of those things.
<1> I hate that you were able to find a new job and I hope that you get fired soon. 
<0> I couldnt,   didnt have the heart I tried to push his head out the window as best I could.
<1> smoking is a perfectly fine habit.

<1> I like country songs that are happy, and like line dacing to them
<1> Oh, i love it too but I like to walk alone.
<0> Have you ever gone to a country music concert? I've seen kellie pickler.
<1> Dont be too extreme, you have to remember to still eat well - good fruit and veg and protein.
<1> Sometime it is bad to have some memories of when you were a kid you can just hate it after all.
<1> Nah. I'm a pretty skinny guy. I don't need to lose any weight.
<0> No, I am not but my bigger sister is married.
<0> I overspent at the mall. My grandma helped me cover it though.
<1> That sounds awful, so glad I don't have to worry about that.
<1> Building you own house is more trouble than its worth

<1> do you work for a psychologist ? say , what is your favorite color ?
<0> i prefer the the volkswagen passat R line, i have in my garage now

<0> They say that early stock car racing in the US got it's start thanks to prohibition and bootlegging.

<0> Shallow bay was over rated it does not have any great songs
<0> I certainly do,  which makes it easier for sure.
<0> They might taste similar since they are closely related, common ones that are eaten are shrimp, lobsters, crabs and crayfish. Crayfish remind me of insects a lot.
<0> They kind of went off on me ad disagreed. What I said wasn't offensive,  just irrelevant though lol.
<1> i just came into a lot of money , i should get a dog now .
<0> Nope so I just left work early haha.

<1> I hate their drummer though
<1> Maybe I'll order from my favorite Korean place that delivers. I get them all the time.
<0> I bet it was. People often tell me my lush thick hair reminds them of his.
<0> I would like to go to back to college to get a better job that i actually enjoy doing.
<0> I like collecting other things, especially country music records! I love country music. 
<0> I guess memories are always nice of them
<0> That's why I don;t like to shop that much. I never know what to buy and sometimes I get the wrong thing.
<1> That's uncommon, usually visitation rights are pretty straightforward in divorce cases

<1> I was born and raised in Kansas City.
<0> yes , my brother an i have bright red hair .
<1> the family beet farm is my pride and glory . the greatest .

<0> i own a creepy mansion that reminds me of a horror movie
<1> I'm sorry, I don't do any IT work, I work as an accountant. 
<1> Keep it that way. If too many people find out it might ruin the experience.
<0> I think I will, that and accupunture has really helped my back.
<0> Exactly! I felt like all eyes were on me and they were judging me! He normally doesn't act that way. I guess he was just tired.
<1> I think it's ok and you shouldn't worry about going back.
<1> I don't think you need confidence just show up and that should be enough.
<1> Oh well that sounds like it ended well at least. What was the fight about?
<1> So glad to hear about this.
<1> No, not all. It's basically a group of 10 islands close together.
<0> I definitely won't forget when I get back, especially because it's due tomorrow.
<1> I wouldn't be worried about that, its just a friend.

<0> I don't know how to read. They don't teach us how to here in Texas where I live.
<1> have you ever heard of the band the muggers .
<0> Like most other mammals, cats have poorer color vision but a better sense of smell than humans.  Just a couple characteristics pedigree cats are known for.

<1> I bought a paddleboard at Walmart but I was upset when I realized I could have gotten a cheaper price at Target.

<0> I do not get enough time to work out because I am still in high school
<0> I also had an elaborate train set as a child. 
<0> I took the day off work so I can hang out with friends. We're going to play a game of football together, which is one of my favorite things to do!
<0> Yes,  I know I have to let him grow up,  but he is my baby and I want to know he will make the right choices. Sometimes it is the other kids you have to worry about more and the influence they have when they are starting high school.

<0> Most days I start at 5 and finish at 3.
<0> I love excitement!
<0> I think I will just do exercising, I don't think dieting works at all. 
<0> Maybe, I bet it is very pretty in the summer time though. It would be a nice place to live.

<1> Yes, Alien Workshop skateboards.
<1> I'm not sure though.

<0> Also the character is not named after the actor and race driver Steve McQueen.
<1> I didn't want to hear more about what happened.

<0> Those all sound fantastic, I heard they even filmed the walking dead in Georgia, thats really cool. Any other good Georgia facts I need to know? 
<0> I spent so much time talking about studying and didn't really study that well. I think I'm gonna have to inquire about the grade,  it's eating me up inside!
<0> That's understandable. George foreman grills are so small and easy to carry away.
<1> No, I wouldn't recommend talking to a physician. Usually, I treat myself at home
<0> I really like that one too. They even have great chicken like the nuggets and the McChicken. I also love their desserts.

<0> It's too bad I only eat hot dogs, you're really selling the corndog.

<0> What is your favorite team? I just watch the super bowl sometimes but my wife loves the patriots
<0> I just make sure i drink a bunch of water.
<0> Interesting...so as a mother do you get embarrassed if your son is too clingy in public?

<0> I know the name, unfortunately I am lacking in that area.
<1> I'm sure you will find a job soon, it's easy. 
<1> That's so lame,  you should maybe tell your boss about it though.
<0> If I had a parrot I wouldn't make chicken wings from it!

<0> That sucks, I work on airplanes for a living. 
<1> yes it is very relaxing to me .
<0> Your roommate is not annoying at all and I do not care about your situation or whether or not you play computer games often.

<1> I don't like to travel. I prefer to stay at home as well.

<1> It was founded in medieval England.
<0> Amusement parks and theme parks can still be great fun without open car roller coasters.
<0> No, only cats. That's why I've only donated stuff for cats to animal shelters.
<0> I hate reading comic books!
<0> Why would you want to, there aren't many investment opportunities here.
<0> I didn't eat yet but I can't return it. 
<0> it isn't but what about the resources?
<0> Very Cool! My fav is Fanny. How old are you?
<1> No I don't like movies and only read books in my spare time.
<0> Well my friend told me its fun to discuss politics while driving as time pasts fast you know
<0> i got fired from my last job for saying "good luck getting through the VA system"
<0> Dogs and cats mostly, but anything that comes along we try to help. We had an injured skunk once!
<1> I have seen my grandma as a ghost before as-well!! 
<1> You are the only one who know answer to that.

<1> Well, my investigative journalism is my favorite type of journalism, so I'll introduce you to some of the writers that I know and you can ask them.

<0> i am some what educated
<0> I'm not sure, I don't like them very much.

<0> Ok, I don't like the books though. I prefer Harry Potter. 
<0> He better, or I will divorce him. I told him to get carrot cake since that's my favorite. 
<0> Florida has an extensive history that hearkens back all the way to the Native Americans inhabiting it 14,000 years ago. Then you had Europeans coming by, and Juan Ponce de Leon in 1513 came by as well, which is important, because 1513 was the beginning of the American frontier, as it was the first realm of the U.S. the Europeans settled.
<0> I think the right thing to do is,  if people around you know what you should be doing or where you should be going,  they should tell you plainly. To not do that is providing them plausible deniability if you screw up.
<1> Well that's understandable. Regardless of age, drugs are bad and are inexcusable.
<0> I will do that!  I want to become a foster parent as soon as I can to help these poor children so they don't have to live with their family and have a bad reminder of their past everyday!
<0> No, i don't want the kids to have fun

<0> what kind of dance do you do ?
<0> Oh no I don’t know anything about that brand at all.
<0> In 2016, Hershey acquired barkTHINS, a New York-based chocolate snack foods company which expected to generate between $65 million and $75 million in revenue for that year, for $290 million.

<1> Nice, chihuahua are the tiny ones, right?
<0> Mountaineering seems so boring.
<0> The Appalachian Trail is 2,200 miles, so my hikes there are in and back hikes.  It's best to carry water, snacks, and a map with you even on a short hike
<1> In that case steak and lobster won't be good to eat because it will leave a horrible after taste.
<0> No, because I like to pick it up at the store. I love pepperoni pizza the best!

<1> Oh, really? Same here! It sucks being an only child.
<0> I totally agree. Too bad my girlfriend wouldn't let me listen to any at all today.

<0> True. I realized that as soon as the alcohol wore off,  and I went back home to my boyfriend,  then made up with him.

<0> Definitely something to think about.  What do you do?
<1> I agree, you are right about those allegations, they were also confirmed by other artists to be true, as well as other worst accusations. That all made doubt about who really wrote his songs? I don't actually believe it was all him.
<1> Benjimine--is that a French name? I have never seen that spelling.
<0> I don't want to talk about football
<0> Pigs are pretty useful, even without eating them.

<0> Why trying to see her? I know she is not famous
<1> How long does it normally take to complete a Master's in that field?

<1> That doesn’t sound right, I thought they usually lay around all day.
<1> No, I don't like to drive fast, especially in my minivan. I'm all about safety. 
<1> Any renowned ballet dancer you know?
<0> Nowadays, there is that Master of Science in Management, abbreviated MSc, MScM, MIM or MSM, a Master of Science academic degree 
<0> My mother immigrated from South Asia at the age of 8. I have learned a lot about their culture from her.

<1> That's sad.
<0> My Master's exams in philosophy

<0> I agree.  My sister and I were talking about that yesterday.
<0> I don't know what I would do without my two dogs.
<0> I like baking too, I wouldn't say it's a hobby but it's really soothing & fun.
<1> Like I said, just be careful.
<0> I hope so.  Most vacations I have planned we ended up cancelling because we didn't have the money.  I'm trying to not dwell on it and find what I'm thankful for but its hard to let go of that feeling.

<1> Oh! I dislike Double Dare when it came out, never watched the reruns at all.
<1> yes ! i've 2 children and i'm so glad they have not developed it yet .
<0> I like to read philosophical books, how about you?
<1> That must be insane.
<1> I only like thin crust and cheese only.  I always order that.
<1> thats not much rain hopefully you get more!
<1> i actually haven't read the books. i just watch the movies because i hate reading
<0> Thanks, but the show has been cancelled so I will have to find another way to express my cooking skills .
<0> Yes a lot of museums in Dallas have items that are temporary placed there so there is a lot to see
<1> well, nothing like a relaxing vacation. Glad you enjoyed it!
<0> Oh wow so they have really sharp claws? Do they shed?
<0> That's a hard deal. How many people are unemployed?
<0> Would you agree that the function of criminal law is to provide a social mechanism with which to coerce members of society to abstain from conduct that is harmful to the interests of society?
<0> They have amazing durability but I prefer traditional art over sculpting to be honest.
<1> That's ok. I am not that interested in hearing your stories anyway.
<0> They're like the size of grapefruits, but more similar to tangerines in taste, from what I can remember.
<1> I totally understand that, my husband is so needy too lol
<1> i usually drive to work and back home.
<0> Oh,  no I'm sure he was dead. Made me think of all the times I had to nab up all that sweet,  savory roadkill a few years back to fill up my empty stomach. Times were tough.
<0> It went perfectly! Today has been a dream come true!
<0> I love animated movies the most. Really just about any movie is good to me, except for horror movies. I refuse to watch them. 
<0> they don't like baseball like i do . rio , sao paulo and lots of other places .
<0> I wish I could meet someone famous. I've never met anyone that I admire like that.
<0> Yeah, Other optical causes are astigmatism
<0> Yes, thankfully the tea didn't get into the electronics.
<1> There aren't any local pizza places here.
<1> I bet someone did see it! 
<0> Me too.  Hbu were you ever a shy kid or were you always extroverted
<1> Avatar is actually average. Battle scenes are so so.
<1> Do you play soccer or watch it on television? its a lot of fun, 22 men after a small ball.
<0> I hate going to the beach.
<1> Laughs, yea I love baby shark and that song!  I can't get it out of my head once it starts up
<0> They did.  I could tell that they were disappointed and mad at the same time.  I regretted my decision.
<1> My boyfriend and I work at the same place , I don't remember seeing him unhappy with what he does. 
<0> I've never really liked soccer for some reason.  I could never get into it.
<1> Yeah, but it doesn’t look anything like Spanish hunting knives
<1> i miss more money .. also 
<1> They do not work or everyone with my issue will be using them,
<0> I have to admit they were way better than I expected and I would love to hear them again. Congrats on the baby!
<0> I should have did my graduate to get a good job like you
<1> Really, so you haven't won any awards yet for writing?
<1> Okay. I don't want to offer you help. 
<1> oh yeah.... that is a wee bit creepy... LOL
<1> Yeah that stuff is addicting
<1> That's okay, cutting someone off doesn't usually cause accidents. 
<0> I have, but I really don't want to go back to school!
<1> Sometimes. Don't have to worry about too much human interaction
<0> Thanks! She loves rollercoasters! I can't wait to take her.
<0> i bet , what you late for ?
<1> I wish I knew a foreign language.
<1> Yeah, dude. Me, too. I've stopped working out as my muscles are way too big. 
<1> yeah how come you chose them to write about
<1> You screw everything... I think you have to work very hard until the end of your life.
<1> I am planning a hiking trip, not a trip to the lake?
<0> I looked it up on the internet. They don't usually serve sushi with ginger but I do like it!
<0> I am with myself,  and sure I am going to follow through! 
<0> Ah, a fellow artist at heart I see. I make films myself. 
<0> yes , looking forward to it. Have you been?
<1> I would probably say Siglo Vente would be the one I remember most from my visit there.
<0> I have not, what are they about?
<1> I am a mechanic. It is so exhausting. Like today i am so tired I slept immediately i got home.
<0> That is interesting. Also interesting that they aren't even from China, yet only seem offered in Chinese restuarants
<0> For me its a relaxing activity so Ill keep doing it!
<1> Good point. Any example to share?
<1> I have some friends who can tell you about all the best Florida beaches. I need to visit that state one of these days.
<0> Yeah I don't really enjoy my job right now either.
<0> Apparently,  after having a shower,  he forgot to close the water flow. That seemed to me to be a truly stupid excuse
<0> I love the heat, Summer is by far my favorite season!
<0> I can only imagine how beautiful it is. My Mom's dream destination is Ireland.
<0> I think it would like it too.  I really enjoy working indoors in an office.
<0> I do! do you own any?
<1> No way!! I hate musicals and broadway.
<1> It started in the United States in the early 18th century
<0> to grandparents house for the weekend
<1> Reading and me never go hand in hand. I have no time to read.
<0> I think that's great!
<0> I really don't care if he has a female as his best friend.
<1> yeah I love to do daily vlogs with my pet on my channel.  
<1> Oh yeah me too, I listen to it everyday.
<1> I love doing portraits of people. It's fun and challenging to try to capture their spirit in the picture.
<0> We have a home to live in but we lost everything
<1> Both of my girls have boots for school and they like them just fine.
<1> speaking of staying on the ground, I work at a hospital.  what about you?
<0> Oh, I thought my wife Jessica told you that.
<0> Am Going to walk
<0> This will be my first job if ever I get hired.
<1> That has never happen to me before though.
<0> Yes, got addicted to this on my previous trip to France
<1> cool cool . my cat is named charlie . and i live the vamp life haha
<1> Wow, you have an extremely unlucky life. I will advise you to not play the lottery.
<0> I am not sure. My girlfriend is very understand and wants to go clubbing with me.
<0> its really neat when you see a manta ray jumping out of the water ! like a bird .
<0> Are you also afraid of heights?
<0> Ohhh the sound is great.
<1> I feel pretty strongly about staying a renter, I like that they take care of yard work so I don't think I'll buy anytime soon
<0> I love the city, but as I age, I've begun to long for the country.
<1> yeah, i dont really like sports
<1> Not me, I hate hot dogs.  I always feel like it's impossible to tell what kinds of meat go into them.
<0> They would with me. Do not forget I am the head-chef in a French restaurant.
<1> I've only ever had cats now I'm thinking about getting a puppy.
<1> pretty color . what is your passion ?
<0> have got brown eyes what about you?
<0> Well,  he's usually dependable. And it is a favor to begin with,  so I can't get too mad. It's just I asked for it as the only thing I'd like for my birthday,  and I was kind of hoping for it to be done.
<1> right now melisa mccarthy . you ?
<1> Ya, it's sad that most people don't feel the same way we do about family.
<0> Me too lol. What is your dream goal in life?
<0> I also agree with that, plus there are man fields within this for anyone to be interested in.
<1> Luckily you only damaged your bike and didn't get hurt. 
<0> I am very proud. She is such a great kid. I just wanted her to do her best. Doesn't really matter she gets straight A's or not.
<0> She actually can't stand when things surprise her, so a surprise party is something I would never plan for her. She'll hate it.
<1> I wish I had nieces or nephews that I could spoil. But I don't.
<1> I never got along well with my family, so I try to avoid them as much as possible.
<1> yeah me either i don't have a vehicle
<0> Not really,  but after the first day it was a lot easier and I knew that I had made the right choice.
<0> i have never been to nashville . planning on going there sometime .
<0> I love that show, I watch anime all the time!
<0> I bet Acadia Park is beautiful, are there mountains and small islands around it?
<0> no a sports coach hahaha
<0> Yeah, I hate it though. It's too much work. 
<0> I was on the Dean's list last semester. 
<0> Oh, that is a good point. I will look into that.
<0> Yeah. I have really never tried to help homeless people before. I feel like I should.
<1> that is awesome . i love baking . i love to eat sweets .
<1> I don't know anyone under the age of 30.
<1> would you pet me like a cat ?
<1> I don't have a dog
<1> Makes sense, that's usually what would keep me up is the runny nose. Those along with the sore throat is usually the worst. 
<1> totally relatable . that can be a stressor
<0> Me too! What is your favorite thing to cook?
<1> very exact of you ! the hair was reddish so i think it was my own . lol
<0> Natural selection. Hair is needed to protect us from the sun. No fur makes us run faster which we needed back then to hunt.
<1> horrible why would you go out in your pajamas 
<0> It was very tragic. But, they were loved. Many friends and family came to the funeral.
<0> No, I don't have any favorite teams; I hate watching sports.
<0> yeah, they are a bit different.  I think it also depends on whether they are baked or fried.
<0> Yes.  I like to fly into Shannon, rent a car, and stay in bed & breakfasts.
<1> I hate to study. but like to read.
<1> Get a dog.  They're better companions.  Cats are sneaky.  That's what I don't like about them.  And if you get one, watch out for your goldfish.
<1> True,  is it a fun place too go?
<0> I believe that is standard for all states? Collisions are a huge problem with over 54 million people who were injured in 2013.
<0> I live in Houston, Texas
<1> I guess I could have put in more effort and worked harder.
<0> Baseball games don't usually last that long 
<0> He lived over 10 years,  and he was just a mixed breed. I was definitely very sad when he passed but we have a lot of great memories together.
<1> Dang she sounds stupid, good for him , i hope it lasts and he keeps smocking crack
<0> I want to quit the other two jobs and have only one job.
<0> My favourite cheesecake flavour is strawberry cheesecake.
<1> I saw it last week, it wasn't even that scary.
<1> No. My family hardly ever travels
<0> Mine is orange. How is Manchester? I have never been.
<1> That's awesome! My cat is still in the kitten stage, so she is very crazy. How old is your cat?
<0> Well I got it on my face, so they are bound to see it.
<0> It was. Wish she would've told me!
<0> i'm on the west coast . i assumed you were too with a prius
<0> Well shes not related to me in any way so i dont care.
<1> Oh adoption is a good idea, I didn't really consider that, but it seems like the ethical choice.
<0> I hate reading. I'd never spend my time that way.
<0> That's great. I am working as a supervisor in a textile show room
<1> I like to listen to rock music and my favorite music group is Muse.
<0> No I was thinking about getting a dog but they are so mean and standoffish. 
<0> well i wasn't born there.. i just live there now. 
<1> the color of sunflowers :)
<1> I love sweets... especially chocolate cake!
<1> I didn't make an egg sandwich. I cooked a jacket potato.
<1> Anime is dumb and not cool, I think it is boring.
<0> Sounds like fun! Especially when it is from the comfort of your own home (or bed :))
<0> i have nothing with anything medical, I work in the accounting department >)
<0> I have never heard of them !
<0> congratulations on retiring!
<1> i'm single i work at a bank what do you do for a living ?
<1> Oh well,  be carreful.Make sure nobody is following you.
<0> Thanks. Right now I need to find a job being unemployed and all.
<0> I've known her since we were kids and we have grown so much together.
<1> i would probably like hip hop more if i had not been born premature .
<1> Right exactly I agree. Do you ever get to watch movies? Any favorites?
<1> I don't live in an area that is known for tornadoes but they still scare me. I'm glad you're ok!
<0> it kind of is actually .
<0> Thats ok, I've had a bunch of experience so far. 
<0> He's written 5 books!!  I had no idea - the dude is multi-talented!
<0> Except one stranger did and I was so embarrassed,  lol. I wish I had checked the back side before I left my house,  ugh.
<1> I like blue and white, reminds me of Christmas.
<1> i don't have any . do you ?
<0> i like to drive around with my doberman charley .
<0> My wife is an ICU nurse who works night shift.  So i am usually home alone 
<0> I wish I had a girlfriend
<1> Small world - me too!
<1> do you know jimi hendrix ?
<0> you can use puka shells which is Hawaiian for "hole"
<0> Right? They're really small, and native to western countries.
<1> I'm not sure yet, but i'm sure ill know when I see her
<0> No unfortunately I am too busy with my career to volunteer my time, I'd like to some day though
<0> I do not know about first juggler and it's visit to circus.
<1> Yes and it always bothers me looking through scatches.
<0> My parents passed when I was 8. The orphanage allows me to work about 15 hours weekly.
<0> I wish McDonald's sold tater tots. I don't like fries.
<1> I really don't feel sorry for you since you should have seen that she wasn't for you.
<0> I have been to Ohio multiple times.
<0> Alfred Hitchcock movies are great. And no, Sterling. What about you?
<1> Yeah it is very sad i am sure if we had kids they would cry also
<0> Mostly sports games,I try to get my classes and studying out of the way What do you like to do?
<1> I don't know, man.  I think she might have been the only one.
<0> Photography bores me
<1> I am more of a cat person. But if I had to choose a dog breed, I would choose a small dog, like a Pomeranian.
<1> That is incredible ,  my dad had canswer and we had people from our church pray for him and others did as well and his cancer went into remission.
<1> you could but i hear it is not worth it.
<1> I try! If only I had a spouse with which to hunt and lobby. I am not married though. 
<0> Damm. I only have one dog. it sucks, wished i had more.
<1> That's good. I just don't like burger king enough to work for them
<1> Oh no!   What does he do that upsets you?
<1> i am a college student from cali
<1> hmmm, i don't and never give my children for daycare. 
<0> texas got hit by one too and houston is still flooded in spots
<0> That's another good point.  Social inhibition can be unhealthy; there needs to be a balance of socialization and alone time.
<1> I don't like the beach, I am scared of the ocean. 
<1> I crave broccoli ice cream everyday because those are my favorite flavors.
<0> i don't have time to cook i always order my meals
<0> Me too. But I’m still going to be salty that I’m not on it
<1> i have a huge husky it is sweet
<0> that's true ,my family says that too. my family has a gas station
<0> I haven't watched the movie, so I don't kow the soundtrack, But will try to listen to it, what is its name?, 
<1> Yeah. And the kids will probably have a hard time adjusting and making new friends.
<0> i do not think i've ever seen it . what is it about ?
<0> ugh I want to visit the UK so bad, I was hoping you'd been and had some stories for me!
<0> We have the environmental veganism which relates to .eating a plant-based diet based on the indications that animal-based industries are environmentally destructive or unsustainable.
<0> A fruit diet sounds healthy.
<1> Last year I started reminding my family about a month before my actual birthday so they wouldn't forget and get me nice gifts.  
<1> Thats awesome. So glad!
<0> At the moment they're saying it really harsh and constantly sun blasted all year round.  Not exactly a holiday destination!
<1> Yes but my time in the Nascar races should be enough
<1> Nah, I'll check it out after I finish watching The Conjuring this weekend.
<0> No, not really. I hate reading, it  is so boring! I prefer watching TV
<1> Shes planning the biggest baby shower ever, she is going to invite everyone in our contacts!
<0> I just wish that I could go on holiday soon.
<0> Whatever you do, imagine her fully clothed. 
<0> yes , but every one who looks at me wonders why am like that .
<1> that's fine. advance happy safety partrol day
<1> rofl, for sure.  I'll never forget that day, it was so cold--I love cold weather, but this was too cold.
<0> do you like a michael  jackson
<0> It was at the time,  but I am over it now
<0> Indeed! It's good to get some that covers UVA and UVB. I believe one causes aging, whereas the other is a cause of cancer, but can never remember which is which
<1> You know i never went to high school.
<0> Yeah. I'm thinking of moving down to Florida when I turn 50. It's just gorgeous down there.
<0> I really want to go to the South by Southwest festival
<1> that sounds exciting and fun ! where are you from ?
<0> Yeah they work very long hours but they don't get paid much
<1> hat are you talking about?  I have not seen a 21 year old drunk before.  I am Amish.
<1> That stuff was corny and wouldn't have meant much to anyone
<1> I know!  I hate pizza!
<0> Whats that? I've never heard of it
<0> I have been employed as an Electrical engineer for around 5 years now.
<0> I saw a dead dog on the side of the road.  It was not a good sight to see.  I felt bad that it was someones pet
<1> Well I think you should be careful not to do it again. That doesn't happen to everyone very often
<1> Of course you can't do it, what do you expect.
<0> California is really hot, I also don't like heat. 
<0> i like to read sci fi too
<1> A crazy villian
<1> Yes I have actually. It was scary.
<1> I hate going to the movie theater.  I never go.
<0> I drink my coffee black.
<0> yeah they would never do that at a youth group itd make them way more distant from god
<0> tuna is my favorite though chips while i read you
<0> Not of huge fan of blue. It's one of my least favorite colors. I think nothing is more beautiful than orange. 
<0> I would have to be in the back room. I could put his food and water there along with a bed.
<1> I know what a pallbearer is.
<1> Yes, she was very local and did not bear any influence or inspiration on the new generation of artists
<0> in pretty mountainous areas
<0> They are located in California.  And I just looked it up and the movie made $211 million dollars!!! Wow!
<1> Don't get too caught up in it. You'll probably get sick of it.
<0> So would I, I've never been to one myself.
<0> then change your approach , start off with something light .
<1> that would be interesting to do . i like to hike just got to hike the appalachian
<0> Can you name me a great teacher currently or in history that has shaped our society as we know it? I have always been curious as to see peoples perspective n this question.
<0> I'm a woman too, so I would never grow a beard.
<0> Wow, I don't meet many people who agree with me on that stance.
<0> I think so. That's why I never lie to him
<1> nope, i didn't put a lot of thought into it while naming I guess. duh.
<1> I don't need a haircut today 
<1> I would be so calm right now. 
<0> To be honest,  i have invested considerable amount in cryptocurrency market. I am hopeful for them to lift me out of financial burdensome
<0> we were just going to chill but he had issues come up
<1> As long as the dog isn't too big and I can keep it on my lap, like a toy tog.
<0> Yes with just seconds to spare!
<0> New England is a beautiful area. I am originally from Madison, Wisconsin.
<0> No,  it is so irritating to see.
<1> i bet , but it isn't my fault . i blame other people
<1> I don't know. Parking lot accidents are minimal. 
<0> i appreciate the feel of a good book being 82 . you like your work ?
<1> Whoa that sounds incredible. You are very lucky to have witnessed that.
<0> It is cool how they just zoom through all these awesome announcements,  that is what I like
<0> Lol, I really like that show too.  It's definitely an unusual job, but I love it.
<1> I understand your issues. Well, you have to do it you have to do it.
<1> maybe take a break from working and just enjoy the summer at the beach!?
<0> That's true. I wish I think I will try to reduce my consumption of meat. I know it is not good for me. 
<0> No, people should only follow abstinence and so that is all that should be taught in schools
<0> I do not need any example of brass instrument.
<0> I recommend doing it with lots of cars around you. It makes it more challenging.
<0> I don't really care enough about Wicca to teach it to anyone else.
<1> It's okay, I wouldn't say the host is worth watching though.
<1> Yeah same here, I only started reading as an adult
<1> They’re my favourite as well. I’ve watched all their recent games.
<0> hmm i love computers, but im not sure if that would carry over into a job for me or not
<0> I have a cat
<0> Why?
<0> That's okay, I don't think I need medication at all.
<0> you like waiting tables ? i have two sons . they're my world .
<0> gave up on your dream ? how sad . . .
<1> Oh I am not so surprised. You are not so young also.
<0> i don't like tea it is too bitter, especially darjeeling
<0> My friends mean the world to me.  They are great.
<1> That's too bad. Perhaps if they'd been nicer you would have become a customer! I like to make my own bagels.
<0> They're very highly regarded in professional audio lines of work. Bose is a large company with $3.8 billion in revenue.
<1> Dresses and fancy stuff are silly and not representative of culture.
<0> Just one, and he is 9. 
<1> I've read that one by HG Wells, it's great!
<1> No. This will be my first time.
<0> I didn't do anything to help. What are you talking about?
<1> i want to learn a new language , japanese mostly
<1> that's a fast car ! i love driving through the country
<0> Thunder from what I see
<0> Same, since I live in an apartment, I can't have a dog.
<0> Yeah feel like it. I very content with the current one as well
<1> you must be frustrated on your grands 
<1> the guiter is my best instrument to keep me happy
<0> I eventually did,  but I didn't realize how I really felt about her instead she was never around.
<0> No, I hate all medical shows
<1> i enjoy makeup but not people
<1> That sounds good.  I wish I was a good cook.
<0> Thanks.  I know life is perfect but its a journey and I'm satisfied with where I am right now.  
<0> That's cool.  What religion are you?
<0> they are 4 and 6, I love Halloween because i can take them trick or treating
<0> It really depends on what you like! If you like cats, you can check out "Kiki's Delivery Service."  There's also popular movies like "Spirited Away," 
<0> Damn, I would prefer a watermelon farm because those are my favourtie.
<0> There are no coffee orders, just food
<1> I've actually never been, but I'd like to go someday.
<0> No, I'm not jealous of people born with great genetics.
<1> that s nice . how long ago did you dad pass ?
<0> Swimming is my least favorite hobby.
<0> lol right ! tell me more about you .
<1> Yeah some parts are just cheaper made material
<0> That can not be good.
<1> I agree! That's why I always see my friends. We hangout all the time.
<0> I do not have any pets.
<0> i dont believe in religions also. I am an atheist.
<0> I don't go to Art Musems either. I don't understand art. Looks like they just slap a bunch of paint on a canvas and call that "art."
<1> I really hate weird al. his music is terrible and makes me feel stupid.
<1> haha, yeah. I think any pet you could ride would be great though
<1> I don't really care. laptops and desktops are essentially the same.
<0> I haven't heard from him yet. Maybe he doesn't know it was me? Gosh,  I feel terrible now. I should probably have gone straight to him and offered to pay for it.
<1> Who cares how it affects you? You should worry more about how it affects your loved ones.
<0> Yeah,  it gives me a good reason to stay in and sit by the fire.
<0> Actually, Honda is the leader, Toyota is trailing at the end of the pack.
<1> iPhone 7's are not that reliable, I wouldn't get too excited either.
<1> I don't know, but what's for certain is that I hate karaoke and dogs.
<0> My boss sorry im venting 
<1> When did you start shopping?
<0> Yes, but I don't know anything about guns or the army.
<0> I had a really bad dream last night.  I think I'll try exercising tonight to see if that helps.
<0> It was my neighbor letting me know I left the garage open
<1> Oh, 6 grandchildren is not really much.
<0> I didn't workout at all today, that was yesterday.
<1> what do you do for fun?
<0> Hahaha, same as me! I work for a big marketing company whose logo is pink and actually all the merch
<1> I think its terrible idea to domesticate dragons.
<0> i also speak french too
<0> Not really, whisky is quick and easy to make, and there are only two varieties. 
<0> Yeah dial up was crazy lol
<1> Me too, I hate being inside with music blasting so much.
<1> I'll keep that in mind, where would you normally meet someone else who is into skateboarding?
<1> Nah, that's isn't true, the internet hasn't changed anything at all in people's lives. 
<0> It's okay, she doesn't deserve it, she didn't look attractive. 
<1> I love a local place called Durango Joe's the best but Starbucks is my second choice. 
<1> No, I never travel internationally, I just go places close to where I live. 
<1> You and your wife should work through this. She's just what you need. 
<0> Oh yeah, I love Chinese food
<0> I was out to dinner the other night a I saw a magician do some amazing card tricks.  I couldnt figure them out and I was blown away
<0> I have plenty of time because my parents are both hedge fund managers and I don't have to work. 
<1> what do you listen to ?
<1> Oh wow. I didn't know that. I hate all blue colors.
<1> That is so nice. I never met my dad but I wish I had.
<1> I don't have a parrot.  I have a poodle that doesn't talk. 
<1> Always get money back as soon as possible.
<0> I don't like cars. I don't even drive one.
<0> Yes, he was.  It was so dumb, I hate cartoon characters.
<0> Well, sounds like we have a match! Just kidding. What do you and your kids like to do?
<1> Good because I'm still job hunting.
<0> Yeah, most are closed deck, but there are sit on top and inflatable kayaks that are new and getting popular also.
<1> I'm allergic to nuts so I can't eat eat pistachio ice cream.
<0> that would be funny! what is your favorite color?

<0> I love country music , I  have a nice playlist that we should listen together.
<1> Oh no! But I think black snakes are good? They eat nasty bugs and rodents!

<0> He bought me ice cream.  I am so thankful for him.
<1> Yeah he was just trying to get where he wanted to go, there's nothing wrong with that.
<1> I think they are chosen based on what type of movies they have directed in their years in the industries.
<1> Ok, so where are going for your vacation?
<0> Oh, I like his easy-listening style. I could never stand anything harder than that, not even rock music.
<0> Well that's quite a change in direction! What made you take that leap?
<1> that sounds fun ! do make a lot of desserts ?
<0> lol, well "they" might be biased, and looks to me whoever did the construction had high tech that we now seen to have no knowledge about.
<0> i understand. how much are prices for couch?

<1> I don't have any kids.

<1> That is so cool. I find dogs really adorable and I wish my lifestyle could allow me to have one.

<1> I would make a complaint and try contacting the BBB that is so unfair or even get your bank to dispute the charge. 
<0> What about veggies? I like tomatoes on mine sometimes!
<0> Yeah, they're not too bad. I can barely tell them apart they look so much alike!
<1> Oh, okay. I've never heard of them before.

<0> Hinduism is a strictly religious group of people.
<1> well , i dunno . bubbly . . . i'm more of a workout fanatic kind of guy .
<1> I guess so but I must warn you, I'm kind of the quiet type. 
<0> They certainly had the space for it, that is for sure! I wonder if any of them really survived after all the tragedies
<0> What else do you like to do? I read a lot, but I don't like using adobe to read portable documents. I use a third party program. 
<0> My kids and I love to ski too!
<1> It's pretty fun. The pay isn't great, but it keeps me busy. Decent work for now.
<1> Yeah, I've known for awhile that it was considered a fast food over there.
<0> Lastly,Can a female be bald?
<0> It is hard not to. But I would miss pizza in the states. It's my favorite food. 
<1> I'll do that right now! I'm home and have some free time!
<0> Oh reall? I have a dog at home named Robbie. Do you have any pets?
<0> So what do you do for a living?
<0> He sings one of my favorite songs, "Tulip" featured on a really old album. 
<1> That's weird - I don't care for any nut flavor ice cream.
<0> do you enjoying eating ham ?
<1> I don't think you should get back with her.
<0> I enjoy dying hair. My hair is blonde right now.
<1> That sounds boring
<0> I may try that cause I dont get any kind of exercise around here.
<1> No, I never know who they are and their reviews are useless.
<1> I wish. I just sing. Do you?
<0> I'll take your word for it.
<0> I have, but I didn't like it. I don't enjoy her writing much.
<1> It's not really a big deal. Maybe you should concentrate on something else. 
<0> Have you heard of Rockabilly, its one of the earliest styles of rock and roll music

<1> Well, they make a broad range of products including women's and men's ready-to-wear clothing, leather goods, shoes, and jewellery
<1> I am unfortunately homeless with no money, and am alone in the world.
<0> i really do agree. that is usually my approcah
<0> why are you making a robot
<1> Defiantly no. But to be honest I will be curious to look now. What do you do for a living?
<1> I would visit her but I still have my finger scanning.
<1> i can see that from here d
<1> Wow, do a lot people live in the North of Sweden?
<1> It's okay. My favorite type of coffee is black with no sugar. I hate sugary coffee.
<0> Maybe I'll start looking into it. It definitley would be a change from normal!
<0> I don't have any cats either, I'm more of a dog person.
<1> That sounds pointless, I could not be bothered trying it out. 
<0> Oh and don't forget to check out the movie. Toni Collette deserves an Oscar
<0> No, he cannot catch animals, he is afraid of them. 
<0> We used to go on vacation often when I was younger. Not so much anymore. 
<0> I don't like any shows that he hosts!
<1> I've just watched fifty shades darker, its a rubbish film
<1> I agree on the World Cup but I don't care much for swimming. I never learned how to.

<1> Yes that is all they have there is camping, you can't actually hike.

<0> I enjoyed those shows. Have you done any drawings inspired from those shows?

<1> no . . do you work . i just got off of my shift at mcdonald
<0> we put down stray animals, we kill them
<1> Oh! I hate buying baked goods from local bakery.
<1>  interesting fact to know When did it become a sport?
<1> it says that prominent occult influences were Emanuel Swedenborg and Franz Mesmer and their ideas of spiritualism, new thought, and theosophy
<1> Yeah I go most days can't stop buying ice cream it's my favourite dessert.
<0> No I haven't, I actually hate sunflowers.  Their yellow color makes me want to throw up. 
<1> You know, just relax, don't be too organized cause you never know what would happen. It's not a big deal in many cases.
<0> like standing all in my space
<0> I don't think so, only if I were in college.
<1> I love being around lots of people
<1> Thanks for inviting me, anyway - it was too bad that I couldn't make it to the wedding. 
<0> It's a good thing that people aren't resistant to change. otherwise we wouldnt have made it this far.
<1> I know what you mean. I've somewhat of an expert on Autism.
<0> They are special. Untouched by human progress. 
<1> Oh yeah. Yes Minister is my favorite show.
<0> I do not anymore,  i only remember where the cortex and temporal lobe are but not anything else. Im so focused on other stuff haha. But when thinking about regret people try to say it is the same as disappointment but it isnt. Both are negative emotional experiences relating to loss and outcome and both have similar neuronal correlates but they are still different in a way.
<0> yeah sure could like to join you we go
<0> That's good. I love my job because i get to cook so many types of food.
<0> Okay but nothing too upbeat I do not like dance music that much.
<0> No, I've never been to Hawaii 
<1> Dang. You sure told him!
<1> I'm too busy working to find someone. 
<0> Thanks! It's weird because I never really wanted to run or anything before,  but when I realized I might never be able to really run like I used to could,  it really bummed me out.
<0> they are pretty nice, i love them
<0> I don't like Amazon much, I shop alot at Sam's online.
<0> I have a pomeranian and 2 poodles
<1> yes i also love newyork but i didnt had the chance to go there. 
<0> I saw it it was amazing and mrs.Incredible is so curvy!!
<1> that sounds like a fun trip
<1> I disagree I think mothers are more better then husbands at looking for their infants.
<0> You can if you want to. I never watch creative shows myself.
<1> Don't bother, I don't want to hear from you again. 
<0> I took my pet to a vet who removed it's ability to spray its skunk smell, so now it is harmless. 
<0> I think Im going to sell mine, talking with others doesnt help me win games.
<0> My golden retriever loves getting food under the table.
<0> it depends on the song really. It was the basis of modern music. Like jazz and rock and roll.
<0> My stepfather and I often discuss comic books. We're very close.
<1> families are so great. and it's fun to support our kids. how many kids do you have?
<0> How hard can it be. It sounds like the easiest job in the world to just sit home and relax.
<0> I love to salsa but I enjoy hip hop dancing as well. I hear a lot of hip hop during the day so i'm used to it more. 
<0> Teachers are what matters. We don't need more technology in the classroom.
<0> So many! That's one of the major perks! They make me laugh constantly
<0> Yeah that's why they are the only country that get beer sold to.
<1> I don't know yet. I haven't visited any but I hope to someday.
<1> Sorry, I meant to say that I had the Lexus IS - it was a sedan
<0> me too, am in between job right now
<0> That's kind of rude, there is no need to point out the fact that I am unemployed..now I'm depressed.
<1> Thats awesome. What kind of nature stuff do you right about
<1> It sounds disgusting. I would never try that.
<0> yes they are here on the farm
<0> No thank you, I hate cooking. Its so much easier to do take out.
<0> Me either.  My friends are great.  My best friend invited me on his road trip and I can't wait!
<0> I took an IQ test as a child and they said i had a below the average IQ level.
<1> i wish i had a dog but i only have a hamster
<0> how awesome!! I bet it's so much fun. thanks for all the helpful info
<0> Mainly Panama City, was just there this summer with a few friends.  Something about the sand and waves are so relaxing!!!
<0> I prefer mushroom and black olives. What's yours?
<1> nice job
<0> I majored in business communication.
<1> Not me. I could never do yoga because I have never really tried to flex and it would hurt too much. 
<0> I don't know much about guitars. I think they are the worst instrument by far.
<0> Not in my case, I worked hard but still didn't make the team
<0> I went to Peru to visit my family. I try to go every year. 
<1> Yea I think I exercise enough already 
<0> I don't know a lot about lacrosse, how is it played?
<0> That is very interesting. And now they have $5 million in sales, so they are doing very well. 
<1> Wow I'd love to try German food. I live in Hawaii so I'm far away from Germany and even the mainland.
<0> nope what is that?
<0> How was it? I've been looking forward to turning 21 so I can drink.
<1> I would hate to relive my past, it would be terrible to go back.
<1> I wish I could work in tech
<1> Eh next year they'll have forgotten it mostly
<0> Just as well... I hate to cook.
<1> It's normal to be jealous. It is a product of goals not fulfilled.
<1> You probably shouldn't trust him at all though.
<1> I don't have a collection of cars.
<0> Thank you. I preferred the creative nature of NYU over other schools. I also wasn't aware that the term ivy league has been around for so long.
<1> I am not sure I hate rock music.
<0> We're actually having decent weather here to get outside and exercise. I'm enjoying it!
<1> surely you cannot dye your hair in all your free time . i read .
<1> I never like track and field in school.
<0> The longer I waited the more I didn't like it.
<0> Decorating the Christmas tree with my parents and the Christmas feast my mother used to cook. It was such a wonderful time.
<0> Astounding. What kind of food is there?
<0> i think after that long it makes you family lol
<0> How much did the series make?
<0> He was born in a factory and he was sold into slavery there.
<0> i am looking to purchase a corvette when i retire
<0> No never, pizza is a diner only food
<0> Thanks for your condolences. I'm doing alright,  trying to get over it. Have you ever been fired before?
<1> You'll be fine; I'm not worried at all for you because you still made it to work on time.
<0> Not from that bottle at least.
<1> He always makes me feel dumb when I'm with him. I feel like he always puts me down and makes me feel inferior to him. I'm considering separating.
<0> Oh, Okay, I'm not sure what creatures I am thinking of then. 
<0> yeah,  especially if you believe you are 100% innocent of the charges.  However a $600 fine and to be released sounds better than 2 months sitting in jail awaiting a court date.
<0> Was the change for health reasons or something else? 
<1> i also try to wear cardigans to make me look better . more cultured .
<1> They  came back? I had no idea. I like rock and pop and oldies.

<0> fruit cakes, do you love cakes
<1> That's what I hear too! I'm thankful my girls don't give me any issues. I couldn't imagine raising boys!
<0> It must be boring working that long, I won't wish to work for NASA that long because I don't like the job.
<0> that may be becuase Crichton passed away on 2008, as the author they lost some of that magic I guess
<1> we have that in common.
<1> And I would be glad knowing they would have planned activities
<0> Totally, I never each cheese though.
<0> I was approached because of a small claims lawsuit i filed.  They scrape public records for "juicy" cases and approach people on social media
<0> That's really cool. I've always wanted to compete professional in something.
<0> Yoga isn't too big over here in France. Maybe if I move to the US I can watch american football. I can't stand soccer, too boring, running around.
<0> I created this new world with a great new female superhero.  
<0> Ugh, honey whiskey is the absolute worst!
<1> Why would you do that? Road rage is such a pointless endeavor. I would never respond to something so trivial so violently.
<0> the character name 
<1> I never want to go to a circus - I hate them.
<1> I have, it is very ncie and slow and makes me happy after all.
<1> I have never experienced a song being stuck in my head before.

<0> Funny enough the volcanoes there are alive still
<1> I wouldn't want to live on a farm with cats. I don't like cats.
<0> my neighbors were having a party and one of their guests blocked my driveway and it took them 20 minutes to move their car when I needed to leave today
<0> Haha I guess that works. I actually enjoy watching the field hockey during the olympics, how about you?
<1> I enjoy movies too
<0> I've got a friend who's gonna help me out. Hopefully,  I don't give her too much trouble teaching me.
<1> Hah, it's not for everyone but my dog sure does love begging for it.
<0> Got any favourites? 
<1> That would not be cool to be called a skunk.  Do they always have a stripe on their back?
<1> how nice , i've two cats !
<0> I don’t really read comic books, I think they are boring.
<0> Yes I am super proud of my two daughters.
<1> Nope, they are one of my least favorite foods along with bagels.
<0> that is where my children live . i do not talk to them though . they disappoint me .
<0> Interesting! We have a whole foods where I live; in the city!
<1> I had a Big Mac and fries at the Boston McDonalds.
<0> my favourite singer would be A19HF68K3BLYW. They sing really well and are very entertaining.
<1> Wow, I didn't know babies could do that. I don't have kids and never had any younger siblings so I don't know much about babies
<1> that can be a traumatizing thing to watch .
<0> That's very impressive for how young he was.
<0> not really hard just boring lol
<0> Italy!
<1> It would be fun! I love to have some beers and rock out to the music at parties. 
<1> for the family they are very consistent. i do breakfast and dinner. if they're having a special party it will be different that day.
<0> Yes well I'm glad I got it out of my system
<1> That would be great, some people can earn a lot of money on that.
<0> Some knocked the door forcefully. I was alone at that time.
<0> its some other way of coming out of bad work clean and smart
<1> My favorite places were China, Cambodia, Italy and France.
<0> I believe you are right!  In addition, those who are secondary speakers of a given language tend to carry over the intonation and phonetics of their first language, so there are all kinds of accents out there!
<1> So your dog still roaming round the street.
<0> yes staying positive is important. thats what im telling myself.
<0> O I'm sure you could. The city has so much to offer, arts, sports, education, technology and more.
<1> My hobbies is play cricket in ground and you?
<0> It was for entry into a college program I've wanted to get into. I feel like I did really well!
<1> i really don't like cats
<1> Didn't you find him?
<1> With the amount of technology at your fingertips, you have no excuse for not being able to get your doctorate
<1> I hear you! It's hard not to get into debt, these days. 
<1> I agree with him. Cats are no fun at all compared to dogs.
<0> no thank you. I am happy my husband left me
<0> It is exciting. It is not my prefered team but I like the way they play.
<1> Hell no, You disgusting fag.
<1> I can swim so I can teach you some techniques.
<0> i think 2 to 3 months
<1> my impala sucks
<1> I never worked at pizza place.
<0> Microsoft has made other acquisitions such as Skype and LinkedIn
<1> I am not sure what flowers can be used in wine-making. 
<1> I will definitely give it some thought sounds like you get to do a lot of cool stuff.
<0> I'm a software developer, so in reality, I could work from home just like you! But my bosses prefer me there
<1> I frequent the ladies room since I must have a small bladder. 
<1> It's O.K.  When my grandparents passed they left me some money so i'm not hurting financially
<1> It will happen!
<0> I know, especially when you're 33 like me.
<1> Yes, the park smelled like chocolate everywhere, it was a really special place.
<0> Mostly chocolate which is what I am addicted to.
<0> It was, I liked talking about cake.
<0> I don't take pictures. Never learned how. No need to preserve memories in my life.
<0> Yea it isn't super common, me and my wife plan on adopting kids in a few years ourselves.
<1> I don't like my cats affectionate nature, either. It really gets on my nerves.
<0> travel is great i love tasting new spicy foods
<0> Yeah,  I went to the bowling alley all by myself (sorry,  forgot a word). It was so lonely.
<1> What was inside the parcel?
<0> Oh, then how are we going to transport ourselves and my children to the star gazing?
<0> The town was so quiet last season 
<1> I volunteer myself as taste taster! LOL
<0> They really are great! They even made the Passat CC back in 2008, which was a four door coupe version of it.
<1> Yeah Seattle is great, if I ever buy a house I’d like to buy one in Seattle.
<1> Yes thank you, Phillip Cole movies are always good to see.
<1> i like blue bell. My favorite flavor is classic vanilla or strawberry
<1> No, I really do not like animals.
<1> Oh I love veggie meatballs. Regular meatballs are boring.
<1> Not very awesome. 
<0> I guess nobody does,  but that is how it goes unfortunately
<0> They are just so sweet and delicious, just like any pastries and cakes and pies.
<0> I can't wait for the cold!
<0> Never heard of it. But I can assure you, if I saw something called Dr. Thunder at the store, I'd buy it immediately. 
<0> yep i was making money and i kept losing stuff
<0> Oh I don't really know much about basketball. 
<1> Yes. I love jumping and am not scared about heights.
<0> yea...it is
<1> I think early birds are called B people and night owls are called A people
<0> Yes, of course, I play the guitar as well. I have a recording studio in my home
<0> Not really. I'm my own boss and set my own schedule.
<0> they sure are . i have my own plane too , no need for a tv .
<0> Thats awesome! I want to see her play, but I need to get money so I got a job this past week cleaning gutters
<1> I stay in Europe and I have never been to the US and Mexico.
<1> the dog doesn't like going out with me.
<1> i am still so angry about what my ex said . the nerve .
<0> Twelve.
<1> I would love to live on the coast
<1> its probably worth it though . . . five happy kiddos and a loving husband
<0> I'm not working now, I'm unemployed. In fact, I'm homeless, broke, and forlorn.
<1> I wish I had family that I’d lull be close to.
<0> Nah bro, i don't.
<0> oh, sadly there's barely any beaches or lakes in Canada for me to swim in.
<1> I hid them yesterday.
<1> That's good.
<1> Maybe because you were in Pajamas. You should be ashamed to drive like that. Its dangerous
<1> Ya, and it's even worse when you're feeling sick like I am.
<1> No, I have never played cricket at all.
<0> Ok. But you'll have to talk to me through the bathroom door while I am being sick. I am lactose intolerant and I have celiac. :( 
<0> I hate singing too. I am terrible at it. I ain't good at dancing either. I have two left feet.
<0> No I don't have a coal grill, I don't like the smell from coal smoke.
<1> No, my wife wouldn't like that very much.
<0> No,  we moved away years ago. Unfortunately,  my friends and I aren't in touch anymore.
<0> a Clinic a healthcare facility that is primarily focused on the care of outpatients.
<1> Im telling you- that's why I keep that map in my car 24/7! I do not trust the kindness of strangers...
<0> Yeah and the most popular version is the F-150 and it's now in its 13th generation.
<1> Well I am sorry to hear that. If you need anyone to talk to let me know.
<0> Yes I live in the UK
<1> Impressive, I used to play drums and they were very easy
<0> No thanks, I'm not really into telling jokes, or hearing them for that matter.  I'm a pretty serious person.
<1> I have never volunteered before actually. 
<0> I think I'll use the money after I sell it for a new car.
<1> do not worry it happens sometimes
<1> This is embarrassing but I've never been on a date before.
<0> Do they have the best prices? 
<1> i did not do my workout today.
<0> unfortunately i don't get to travel but i want to . i loved that movie
<1> Oh I just moved to Ohio!
<0> I hate true crime.
<0> I wish,  but no
<0> Hey, since you're not working the least you can do is do chores. for you laziness is not okay sometimes.
<0> I only watch some old tv
<1> I am pretty sure you will get something better. I have never been in a situation like that. 
<1> It seems like fun. I bet a lot of people are always seeking to use it
<1> I only ever eat it with chicken!
<0> i go to the movies . emma stone is my favorite actress she has redhead like me .
<0> you should, but I personally hate going to the beach
<0> Yeah,  they have great work ethic,  I would not be able to do those 24 hour shifts
<1> No, I'm more of a natural hippy type girl. I hate makeup.
<1> Well that was nice of you
<0> i bet . i love disney movies most of all .
<1> I don't like food. I think is bad for health so I try to eat as little as I can
<0> i hate rap songs i prefer pop music anytime
<1> well , i'm back in school , so i don't have a lot of spare time .
<0> eh , not really . right now i'm trying to learn the stock market .
<0> i don't have any favorite dish, i love junks instead.
<1> I think so! They are commonly know for being intelligent and playful! They definitely have that gentle personality.
<0> I know a lot about books
<1> You should just give up and apply for disability.
<1> yes, i was eating hamburgers
<0> haha right jobs are important . they must also love dogs , i've 2 .
<0> It only took a few hours which was lucky because I was so hungry and did not know what I was going to do.
<0> I hate most sports. Especially team sports. I only like gymnastics really. 
<0>  Recycled ones. boxes, bags etc. Cacti sound interesting. I want to learn to grow vegetables.
<1> i am feeling active
<0> Not in particular but I can tell you that height and intelligence have a positive correlation!
<0> What are you doing now since you are no longer in the Army?
<0> you got very lucky . do you have a favorite food i love strawberries hate pickles ?
<1> I'm so sorry to hear that :'(  Why haven't you done something like that in a while? Do you have any close friends?
<0> Not too much, they're really expensive. The kids are old enough to use their allowance money on them if they want
<1> That's good. But I bet you guys were not close with your grandparents. I'm so sad that there were no connections with your family. 
<1> No, I don't really know anything about him.
<1> oh man, sorry about the fins. Im not much better off with the skins.
<1> Yeah,  I like a lot of the actors they've got for that show,  so I'm really looking forward to it. Might save it to binge it though
<0> I listen to it on the way to work in the morning, so it can help me deal with the stress for the day.
<0> I do not help my dad,I lied too.
<1> You should just splurge on the first thing you see that you like!
<1> hp 2000. i may have to return it to the store to be quite honest
<0> No. I don't like to read very much, so I figure I won't like writing, either.
<0> No, not right now. And I am in no rush to get married, either. It's such a pain, you know?
<1> I don't think it is wise for you to date after what just happened with your last boyfriend.
<1> They don't have any movie options right now though.
<1> Ah okay. I guess it's just because the idea of different furniture and colors and all that can make such a big difference in how the same space can look. That's what makes interior design so cool.
<1> Well hopefully that was the last dangerous encounter.  Maybe you should write a book.  :) 
<1> how about the hobbit?
<1> My older brother isn't so bad but the rest are a handful.
<0> The knife was invented in the 18th century.
<0> Yes, oatmeal cookies are my absolute favorite!
<0> But the dry cleaning job is good , so stick to it.
<1> I'm not sure, but I hate steaks that are too thick.
<0> Sorry, I have to leave, I need to walk my dog.
<0> Just don't get OPI, they are not a good nail polish brand.
<1> I really dont care if they are upset.
<0> Reading doesn't take all that much thought or creativity. You barely use your brain at all when reading.
<0> I barely walk with living on campus for my studies. 
<1> He hasn't worked for it and should be jailed. 
<1> I like absolutely NONE of her stuff.
<0> I love cold weather with strong breeses
<0> Ohhhh that sounds delish! Macaroni is known in America as a comfort dish and I know it brings me a lot of comfort! lol
<1> This doesn't happen to me often. I was not distracted with whatever is playing in front of me and eat everything in my hands!
<1> It doesn't sound too bad. I don't think it is a big deal.
<0> I wish I would have gone to college.  I quit school after high school. 
<0> i love the company and support
<1> waiting in line drives me nuts .
<1> Okay, some sun block should be enough for California.
<0> It is more in this country or the country that came to be, focusing on more on two people and their relationship. Think Gone With the Wind
<0> Yes, he knows a lot of tricks. We saved a lot of money rescuing him from animal control center, only spent about $50. So we had plenty left to spend on training him.
<1> Oh yeah, me too. The Redskins are probably one of my favorites.
<0> They got really angry and started scolding me for wasting their money. I am so embarrassed I can't even leave my room.
<0> Yes some say he is a treasure of America. He was in several movies about national treasure too!
<0> "Sorry" by Justin is probably my least favorite song by him though.
<1> I'm glad you are getting along well with your roommates
<0> Whats your favorite animal to see at the aquarium? 
<0> Kia is the second largest automobile manufacturers. 
<1> No you don't have too. Little kids can just play with toys and not on video games. It's not good for them really.
<0> You can't sell things to people and become a millionaire unless you go to college.
<0> Yes, of course, I live there.
<1> I am not real sure, I don't know anything about law.
<0> That sounds cool, I want to try it sometime
<0> Yeah, I totally agree they are pretty great animals, I would know I have four cats!
<0> Ironman cool but doesn't really seem like a super hero since he doesnt have powers
<0> There are two types - tabletop role-playing (TRPG) and live action role-playing (LARP). In TRPG, people just sit around a table, but in LARP, they physically perform as their character. Which do you think you would like?
<1> I don't bake I have never been good at it.
<0> I've never done any volunteer work before, maybe I'll try soon!
<1> Wow,  I am sorry to hear that,  I wish I could make it a better holiday for you!
<0> I bought her an expensive diamond ring just to make up for my silly mistake
<1> I really like their song "Love Me Do" from 1962.
<0> That seems like it would be difficult. It takes a really skilled person for sure! 
<0> I am leaving now. This whole conversation has been boring. Good-bye!
<0> Mine too! He is considered one of the most successful skateboarders.
<0> That's cool. I'm not a big fan of cats. that's why I have a big dog name Brutus.
<0> I'm not sure of current policies, but it seems like the government and United States immigration is leanient on illegals.
<0> I don't work anymore. I'd rather be at home.
<0> Yes,  they put a huge crushed in dent in the back corner. They didn't get his plates on the camera :( And it's like $500 to pay the deductible to get it fixed..Seriously- insurance companies suck! 
<0> It is very popular. My Grandad used to have bacon and eggs and a strong cup of tea for breakfast every single day.
<0> I really don't like dancing its too much work.
<0> How is the military life?
<0> Oh I have unfortunately. He is in therapy now because I won't put up with those people in my life and he has to learn for himself how bad of an influence they are. Celebrating his bad behavior does not make a good friend. Thats an enemy truly.
<0> Welding doesn't really allow me to earn much money.
<1> It is not common to forget things in the middle of a speech.  Maybe you should go see a doctor. 
<0> 1845? That's a long time of history 
<0> Well, I should go now. I feel more energized in the morning so I like to get up early to get things done.
<0> cause there were werewolves out there
<1> books ! specifically fantasy genre . harry potter and the like .
<1> how many diamond lost?
<0> I bet! I'm not a lawyer but books overrun my house too.
<0> yea,  he gone.
<0> I am failing all my classes so I think I need to change majors.
<1> I hope that someone got hurt, so that you can get some medical claims done as well.
<0> Yeah that makes a lot of sense, that way government officials are safe!
<1> But still I am worried about the injured one
<1> Would love to, but I'm too busy with my job at the restaurant to have any fun. Last week I worked four doubles. 
<0> Me too, I haven't traveled in years
<0> Well, I don't like photography. It's boring!
<0> Yes a while ago but you can get to know him through his books read them at least one great man.
<1> Yea, changing your diet is very easy, easiest thing I had to deal with.
<1> Have you looked up your basal metabolic rate?
<1> I'm not a fan either, I don't even know the name of that super whatever it was you said.
<1> Oh, me too. I meant I have to go to work.
<1> Yeah, but that dog would probably have been better off not being taken in by you.
<0> scooby doo is my favorite show !
<1> I don't watch NASCAR so I don't know.
<0> Agreed, Some outlets  use machines to make them but to me its not as good as home made.
<1> no i just buy my clothes on the nike website
<0> Yes,  it is. I'm learning to just put my head down and get to work digging out.
<1> I also have my wife to support me.
<0> That is good. Well I have to go to work, I am a nurse and my patients need me. Bye!
<1> i've an exotic pet . his name is ragini . a lizard .
<1> i like superman too but i don't like the new stuff .
<0> Oh that's awesome--the bassist in Black Flag is kind of a loser and I hate his riffs, I don't like the band very much because of that
<1> what do you prefer to do in your spare time ?
<0> Me too!  And I am sometimes influenced by other shoppers.
<1> well me and the wife and kids love traveling in my spare time .
<0> No. I do not drink tea at all.
<0> My goal is to run 3 miles daily. I dont think i will need to increase that too much to be able to compete in the marathon. 
<1> that is your wish
<0> how many year do play ?
<1> i ride my bike to get to class
<0> I hear ya. Here in Nevada we have issues with the rock and clay as well.
<0> It's great! Such a tearjerker.
<0> Indeed. The joy of becoming a parent is overwhelming and I wish for my child to arrive in health and safety
<0> Wow. How many people lived there?
<0> It was a toy! I didn't know they did that anymore!
<0> That's awesome, it's great that you can help people in your job every day. We don't have too many hospitals here in Nebraska, it's a shame.
<0> i love the holiday season. it has a special feel
<1> i am actually cold ! do you not have a c ?
<1> I'm terrible as well, but I do enjoy comedians like Dennis Miller radio personality.
<1> we love it . just take what we can use and use all of the animal .
<0> He never had a white one but did have a black one.
<0> Oh, I should start drinking coffee.
<1> Most people show  good manners. That was not gross.
<0> For sure. I buy wine in bulk at costco. I quite like their Kirkland store-brand Pinot Grigio. I also get things like bottled water and toilet paper there in bulk.
<1> im sorry to hear that.
<1> I think you have overacted.
<0> my mother was a yoga teacher and my mothers mother and her mother
<0> You are right but sometime I can't keep think about it,  mainly when the coworker is not smart.
<0> I think it is more difficult for someone like me, who first learned to speak Spanish. 
<0> I don't have a cat actually. I wish I did.
<0> Yes they do, but I am hoping to advance my teaching career when I have my PhD a few years from now
<0> I don't think these hostages were ready to do anything in good faith. They wanted money and nothing else.
<0> Am usually busy at work and only have up to 3hours to sleep and chill
<0> ya of course you are right... i wish you have a good life
<1> The birthday surprise is very good to see.
<1> i actually volunteer at a local nursing home
<0> Maybe, i dont have any cup and i hate creams.
<0> I drive to work every day.
<1> Exactly, that's the reason why I don't have any.
<1> I'd love to see a ballet in person one day! Perhaps in New York City! Can you recommend a ballet I should see?
<0> I was watching the movie 'IT' and having a plate of fish steak.
<0> I wish I could say the same. I really need to find a job somewhere. 
<0> very true . what is your favorite food ? i love fresh mangos , especially for breakfast .
<1> If you wish to become a teacher you have some extracurricular talents.
<1> Punk is not really my taste.
<1> I imagine haha, although I don't know, I have never had a pet
<0> Aw that's cute! The few times that I went as a kid we couldn't stay very long. 
<0> I don't have a son. 
<1> I guess for some people. I'm not really into Italian though. I love Thai food!
<1> yes , i had to take out student loans to get money to travel abroad . yuck .
<0> Okay. I got to go. I'm about to watch this stupid show called The Voice. My gf likes it but I can't stand it.
<0> Actually I don't care much about it, I do it because my boyfriend likes it.
<1> Wow we are very similar I also like to stay home most of the time and dance.
<0> it is really fun ! i like to take my mom when she'sn't with my grandmother .
<0> Although I hate researching so sometimes if a story is there already I'l just jump on it.
<1> Soccer is fun! I play soccer, too. What position do you play?
<0> Oh I don't really like to draw. I think it's kind of a waste and the supplies are expensive.
<0> yes
<1> Some mum are just naturally wicked. Probably your mum is one of them and am sure she will always avoid you whenever you need her.
<0> Yes, let's go tomorrow!
<1> I actually lived overseas for about 10 years.  Loved it.
<0> Yea it cost me a pretty penny.
<0> That's for sure, I can't wait to find out if I will be accepted.
<0> I tend to become distracted during the day. Too many things happening. do you work better during the day?
<1> this is my last year for retirement of work  
<1> I've heard Australia is crime ridden. I would hate to have to go there.
<1> Nowhere in particular, just any rural area, I really like the small little settlements and villages in England.
<1> I was just a clown. It was fun for a while but then it got tiring. We weren't being treated right.
<0> I prefer hockey. But this my second time hearing about the company
<0> I hear you. I work at a restaurant during the day.
<1> I dont have any dogs
<0> I just don't care to watch them being made by candle makers.
<1> Oh, well I don't hope they return home then. You know, as a zombie.
<0> Oh thats cool i have a few cats and a rabbit.
<0> I think that just the word is Italian, not actually baristas.
<0> Seeing so much beer all day kind of makes me sick of it.
<1> I don't have a dog but I'll look into yoga. 
<0> Which one do you think is much better in terms of effectiveness as I'm unsure?
<0> My dad is a football coach while my mum is an occasional actress 
<0> Thanks. I have had a very strict manager before and she seemed a little stiff and reluctant to let me do anything but prep food and not cook. It was frustrating,  just watching but also being paid and feel like i was cheating them.
<0> Everything is black and white.
<0> Yes it is, great fun; my family loves to go and watch them in the summer!!
<0> Who's Ron Hardy?  I don't know who that is.
<0> I like the food they have too!
<0> I always seem to meet wonderful potential spouses.
<0> We managed to restore my friends house quickly. Luckily no damage to the floors so doesn't require any replacement 
<0> That's very good to hear. I don't want to start using something that goes belly up over night. 
<1> This is why I only buy pre-made frozen burgers.
<1> I've heard The Handmaid's Tale is very good! I'll have to consider subscribing to Hulu.
<1> I visit family and friends.  Use to live there.
<1> I think it would be better if you did this alone.
<1> I don't miss more money at all, I can do without 
<1> It shouldn't be that hard. Building a computer sounds easy.
<1> It's so dreadful outside that I wish I could just go into hibernation for the next few months like a bear does in the winter!
<0> O I thought you were in grad school, I start soon glad I do not have a job it would take to much time.
<0> Thats the hard part!  I feel like I don't know who I am.. or that like I am holding back from being me 100% while I decide.
<0> I have never been to the falls and would love to see that.
<1> pug , boston terrier , and a lab mix ! they are a handful .
<0> I actually want to go to New York, never mind.
<1> I guess so but it sure is a tough job to do.They have so many responsibilities
<0> Yeah, there was another person that I knew would get it since they were a better candidate, but I beat them out.
<1> Sure, the videos of my magic act are pretty entertaining! I'm meeting my partner today to practice a new trick.
<0> going to a friends house for her birthday , and letting our kids play together .
<1> yeah the green things . . . . . . . your body needs more than that .
<0> Which italian restaurant? My wife loves this italian place where the waiters know how to sign.
<1> There is no hurricane.
<0> no video game for me . my parents bug me about it .
<1> Oh I don't like cherries, their gross.
<1> Nope, I don't work in construction at all. 
<0> I hate pasta. i feel choked on them
<1> I already have glasses, i dont need to visit them.
<1> Tell me more about your experiences on the farm.
<0> Maybe I'll that tomorrow! I have to prepare some food for a picnic on the beach, it sounds like it would be refreshing
<1> I watch surfing competitions on TV every day.
<1> I wouldn't make any art. I don't dream of that. I dream of being a mail man.
<0> I agree, I would not want to embarrass myself with my bad singing. 
<0> i am not i just lift weights now
<1> my boyfriend is in the military . he bought me beautiful lilies tonight
<0> I really wish I had some tattoos. I'm afraid that it will hurt. 
<0> oh really? now that is very interesting. I did not know that
<1> i am good , probably going to bed here shortly . long day .
<1> Heck no!.  People are the worst!  Trust no one!
<0> I like to hike and do yoga
<1> Yes.  That looks life beautiful.
<0> I should think about taking some classes, I've always wanted to start working for myself.
<1> I need to get a job myself.
<1> i can understand your pain.. feel the same way
<0> of course i do. living in montreal its almost impossible to do anything with out knowing french. 
<1> Are you a student? Or in between jobs?
<1> I think she was in another film but mostly she has focused on singing and released several albums, beginning in 2007
<1> well what do you enjoy then?
<0> I believe the Canadian Maple Leafs and the Detroit Red Wings aren't rivals at all.
<1> Me too, I live in Japan and don't really see a lot of dogs.
<0> Maybe. She has a lot of mental difficulties that makes it hard to be around her. Short visits are okay,  but anything longer than that gets uncomfortable. 
<1> that would be way to cold for me . i'm a summer girl
<1> Ooh I am from New York I have never been to cali.
<0> I am a stay at home dad.
<1> Oh I know your pitbull likes attention. Being an orphan, you want people to notice you. I sure want people notice me.

<1> Its hard to enjoy it when I am working all the time. I need a break. 
<0> Seems like in the blink of an eye sometimes.
<0> They have many factories today, all over. I just love the idea that it was called "Dr. Pepper" because it was invented by a pharmacist, of all people.
<0> do you like to read ?
<0> actually yes for 20 years now

<0> Can't wait for this baseball game with my friends
<1> When I think about advertising, I think about drinking and realize I'm not drinking and then I get uncomfortable.
<0> EVen more then irresponsible but destructive. They continue to just destroy it and it's very hard to see when so many would kill to have their life.
<1> That is good. It sounds like you were able to be with her before she left. She is in a better place now.
<1> Honestly I think it would be pretty cool if an argument spurs and you guys start a fight
<1> It sounds to me like he won the contest and not you.
<0> I'm sure you'd find a quality product. For me, I'm just regretting I didn't buy stock back in 1994 when Jeff Bezos founded the company!
<0> It was extremely painful.
<1> Honestly marriage is quite dull, I hope he says no and saves you the hassle.
<1> I hope you don't. It makes people stingy, and besides the chances are too low.
<0> Yea, China is the only country that out does us in automobile production.
<0> He did,  I felt so trusting of him. I think I will call on him next time I need a babysitter!
<0> That's insane! How do lizards communicate with each other?
<0> why would we do that, I hate snorkeling.
<1> I see, I have never acted before. 
<0> It's no big deal. I didn't even care that I did it.
<0> It won 5 awards for short film.
<0> Working in an office doesn't seem so bad, you get paid to sit on your butt all day which sounds great to me!
<0> I sure am,  life is good at the moment
<0> i have never been to a music festival but it sounds like fun

<1> That's cool you were on stage for that. Were you one of the musicians?
<0> I loved that series so much that I've read it multiple times. My favorite character was Harry
<1> That wouldn't be too difficult.
<0> Yes,  I am. He is an awesome son. 
<0> That's ok, it wasn't anybody I knew or anyone important, just someone to set up the water service.
<0> Not really i don't understand these psychedelic at all.
<0> Thats what the shrink said. They gave me pills to get rid of him. But I didn't take them.
<1> Try to find a hobby, you need to keep busy.
<0> Yes I have,a pub is the focal point of the community.
<1> what did your friend do to you
<0> But I love my career, I never regret going down its path!
<0> Yeah. Im pretty sure they think I was born in the 50s or something though. They always say the shows are really really old. haha
<1> I can imagine! I've been to St. Lucia and it was beautiful. 
<0> Yes,  I was... self-pleasuring,  if you can understand that. It was definitely an awkward and embarrassing position to be in. I just went out there and tried to have a normal conversation afterwards so that we could move on as quickly as possible. But I was mortified.
<1> How many ?
<0> If I liked exercise I would love going to Central Park.
<0> that's good, I'm always busy with my four children.
<0> you got that right
<0> Only about 6 months really. I'm having trouble to be honest. Every day is a trial.
<0> Me neither I am glad I am in a relationship
<0> Right, and it doesn't usually leave a stain, unlike oil paint
<0> thats okay I have plenty of space in the basement
<1> no , do you ? my dad used to sell insurance . how about yours ?
<0> who does not these days ?
<0> it does , do you make your own ?

<0> it is the history that draws me . i love them all
<0> i like kids though , probably why i write try to write books for them
<0> It had a huge dent but,  sounded fine. I was pretty mad but,  I could tell it was an accident
<1> Oh, my wife has never left.
<0> The cats are fine as there is a screen,  but I am in a bad neighborhood so I don't know what happened and who did it? A bit frightening.
<0> I still don't get it. I don't see how someone like you could like choir.
<0> it just did not seem secure
<1> what ever floats your boat i guess
<0> Yeah, but it's too bad I had to wait until Wednesday for it to arrive.
<0> Sometimes. Do you know a lot about sharks since you are a trivia star and all?
<0> That is definitely alot of "drama". I do like that they keep coming up with creative new emergencies to deal with
<1> Oh. I've never seen an episode all the way through so I'll take your word for it
<0> I have never cooked a meatloaf. 
<1> Georgia is pretty hot right? Hot summers and cold winters there?
<0> Yes - I hadn't taken any before any they thought that classes would be a good idea.
<1> Oh no. Were you upset as well?
<1> That was probably the safest thing to do.
<1> pecan pie is my favourite
<0> My parents are 90 years old. 
<0> But when it comes to diet, I completely avoided cheese.
<0> Do you know how long the show aired before cancellation?
<0> When is the last time you saw your dad?
<0> They are 66 books in the bible.
<1> To retire! think that's gonna be a long time in the future for me.
<1> I am with me being 5'10 its rare that I meet people taller than me.
<1> Overall I don't enjoy dancing very much though.
<0> You seem very immature and dim witted.
<0> She is! Which was why I was irked!
<0> Thankfully not. I just got minor scratches,  but my car got seriously damaged in front as the truck was very heavy
<0> Yeah I love it there it is really nice I went there for a holiday years ago.
<0> It totally made my weekend!  I could not believe it.
<0> It made me miss the past.
<1> Oh me too. Definitely better than that upbeat stuff.
<1> I never had nightmares and was never scared of the dark. Kids should be strong they should not be scared of the dark.
<1> yes i enjoy cooking do you have a favourite food ?
<1> That's ridiculous though! It just a bad idea to do that. I'm sure he won't understand it clear.
<1> i don't like pizza with cheese on it
<1> I would have just got the spider myself because they do not scare me.
<0> It is always good to have someone that will help you in time of needs.
<1> yes i wish i could see old photos of my parents 
<1> Maybe they will party at your house after.
<1> I know it's not healthy, but I eat burgers and french fries at least once everyday.
<0> Win, win! Awesome.
<0> I also appreciate that during the processing spices, herbs, and even different kinds of smoked wood can be added as flavorings
<1> That's is really poor. There is nothing impressive about that, she might not be a good dancer

<1> i'm sure . make things more exciting and listen to avenged sevenfold
<0> I like to see animals on road.
<0> We think he might have some sort of mental illness. He doesn't really want to listen to reason. I'm a single mother,  can't exactly physically intervene in this situation with the best of results. Don't have any family I can call to have them come around either. Can't exactly have the police on-call for something that hasn't happened yet. Don't know what t do!
<0> That would be so awesome! I'd love to have a story all about her too. Seeing everything from her perspective would be awesome. Jasper's story was interesting to me too.
<0> I hope I meet a girl that will date me someday.
<0> Which other animal do you fear?
<1> I love it when it's that hot! My favorite thing to do is go outside jogging when it gets to 100 degrees in the Summer.
<1> No, not really. Bananas are very easy to grow and harvest - you can pick them whenever and it won't affect their taste or firmness.
<1> you don't sound like you know what you're doing
<1> Super slow because i cannot swim. i will drawn in water
<0> Did you read what Kamara said? I am not sure about that

<0> Yes it got pretty popular. Do you know the characters from my little pony? I like the blue pony!
<0> I like fish, but what I really love is a rare juicy steak.

<1> Oh wow! I didn't know that. I only know the ones I see at the supermarkets. 
<0> Yup, its subtropical climate near Miami (where I lived) attracts many visitors.
<1> Wasps are in houses all the time
<1> No, I don't want horses, they are too troublesome to take care of. 
<0> That does sound like fun! Is it a sand and sun or Mediterranean sight-seeing cruise? 
<0> Well South Beach is my favorite.
<0> Yes, they "live in the moment" and don't think about the future. It is too overwhelming for them to process.
<1> I know nothing about the computers.
<1> Same, I love working at a video game studio.
<1> You ex is not a jerk, maybe he honestly forgot it. I agree, I would never recommend anyone to go to Judge Judy.

<0> I dont know much about it or anything but I think it sounds really nice! 
<0> Because my little girl committed suicide because people called her fat :(

<0> No, I already know two, so I don't need to learn a third.
<1> Sounds, great. I work two jobs like a dog just to get by.

<0> Interesting, I knew it was an American dish, but didn't think it had French roots as well.
<0> Nashville?  I love the predators.  They are my favorite hockey team.

<1> Ah, ok. I've heard of the sin bin - is that where people go if they commit a foul? 
<1> so what

<0> I am going too soon. I have to save up for her ultrasound. I have rescued for years but this was unexpected and I don't have 100's laying around.

<1> Then you have all the germs in the pool and the kids pee in the water. How disgusting!
<0> Yeah, it would be cool trip for you
<1> I don't really see the appeal in that, to be honest. I don't have kids, but if I did I wouldn't let them look at ASMR videos. They're a little weird, in my opinion.

<0> I wouldn't know, I'm too scared to ride anything like a roller coaster.
<1> Yup I agree! It is a good thing I don't have cats because I couldn't go through that heartbreak.
<1> That's ok, I don't really care about that at all. 
<0> No one!? The passengers of the other car winded up in the ER!
<0> Oh I understand. I never buy second-hand good especially electronics. I hate a slow computer.

<0> Nervous about the person! It's always a risk having a stranger come to your home!
<1> I agree, but I especially hate choir music.
<0> Oh that sounds amazing
<0> My family does not gather at Christmas, which makes it a really boring holiday for me. 
<1> get me home please.

<0> I like to put all my candles in a large chandelier.
<1> Sorry I lied about the movie, I haven't seen it yet.

<0> Luckily no one I know has a mental disorder.
<1> yes ! so where are you from ?
<0> Thank you. I am so proud of myself and that gives me even more motivation!
<1> I tend to tell my best friend everything, so I started with her. Her acceptance and support led me to have the confidence to talk to my family and professionals.

<1> Thank you. Academics are a great way to get you where you want to be. The world'

<0> Well, almost. I don't think could ever eat a pickle with tea, they are so disgusting.
<0> Oh thats an interesting job title.
<1> what do you do for work ?
<0> Yes,  but I am awaiting a friend. They are bringing me the right medicine to help my pet.
<0> well done job 
<0> I have never gotten into those. They just don't hold my attention enough. 
<0> I agree, they should be aware of their own rights.
<1> Great. I can show my boyfriend his band, he loves rock.
<0> I do love watching it on the Olympics. Those people are so talented.

<1> Is there anything I can do to help?
<0> They truly make a house a home.

<0> GMOs are a great thing brought about by science. They have the potential to be good for our health.
<0> It is that! I think I would be partial to somewhere Mediterranean 
<1> it was pretty bad. My boss would not call me by my real name which is Jane. I think he's doing it on purpose.
<0> He's my landlord's father-in-law,  oddly enough.  I have let him know in the past and will let him know at a good hour.  Next time I'll just call him in the middle of the night and tell him its happening.  Its like he's an insomniac.
<0> i like those too , as long as i have a huge bowl of popcorn to eat .
<0> I could make you some, but sushi is not healthy for you. It is like junk food.

<0> i do not skateboard. i do not like it
<1> Damm. I thought you did that get the invite from AMY.
<1> Maybe, I should look in to a teller job. I don't know. Just keeping my options open.

<0> Scenic beauty is outside though, no air conditioning
<0> I live in Canada so I have nothing to worry about. 
<0> I've never lived anywhere else other than the United States. The law here is enough for me to handle as it is. 
<1> yes, they are doing an archaeological dig there now.  the interesting thing is that the counterculture movement that started in th UK and the USA and which is embodied by the Woodstock concert spread around the world and set the stage for the civil rights movement and the revolutionary stand against Vietnam. 
<1> I think it is fun though
<1> Yeah, they're not my favorite.  I think I'll pass next time they come through.
<0> i am not very good at it .
<0> i'm from michigan . i've some pets
<0> That they seem to mind their own business. Other than that, they are one of my least favorite breeds.
<1> That was very bad of the seagull. Maybe dangerous.
<1> Nice. I share the same birthday as Robert De Niro. Maybe that's why I like Italian food so much.
<0> I used to play soccer with my six brothers and I hated it!  They picked on me and never kicked the ball to me.
<0> No, I do not enjoy playing video games.
<1> Who is H.J. Whitley. I've never heard of him.

<0> I can;t deal with any problems . I don't deal well at all.
<1> Interesting. According to my friends I'm a bit neurotic when it comes to my hypochondriasis but I don't really think so.
<1> That's it?! No wonder she won't forgive you.
<1> Can't be bothered, I never liked the taste of chicken.
<1> That is not great to hear. I am jealous because my daughter is not doing great this year.
<0> Me too
<0> Ok, I will check them out when I visit and see how expensive it is to live in one of these five. Maybe if it's too much I can just go to Jersey.
<0> Yeah,  very,  but I found a good home but I'm going to miss him a lot!
<0> I don't think it would matter to our society, so I don't care. 
<0> We have two boys so i do not know either.
<0> I'm just thankful I have all my valuables intact.
<1> I like it when somebody picks out my clothes. 
<0> They do, Ronnie wood took the place of ian taylor in 1875.
<0> I'm not a fan of either! I prefer cats.
<0> oh, well that's no good. i guess it's not true what they say: "any pizza is good pizza"
<1> i want to move out, but i just remember that warren buffet one of the richest men in the world still lives in the same home he purchased in 1958
<0> I got it online from ....i forget!
<0> Thats very interesting! do you have any food allergies?
<0> oh that makes a lot of sense.

<1> country musics kind of suck
<0> I never want go there.
<1> but sound like pleasant job 
<1> It is probably not worth it to take the time off
<1> No problem. I don't think teachers are really very helpful.
<1> very cool! That's awesome you have that opportunity to do something you love every summer!
<1> Yes it's not normal to lose a loved one!
<0> Yea such as singing, which is way more interesting than boring cake decorations.
<1> Then you need to be more careful and don't need to change stores.
<0> i'm in school studying accounting , are you in school ?
<0> I try to,  but it just gets so hard sometimes. I appreciate you giving me the space to talk this out thank you. I just wish times were just as simple as they seemed when I was younger.
<0> Let's plan it. I love docs. I think you can learn a lot from them and they are fun.
<1> That's so cool! I want to try cooking some veggie burgers on one!
<1> I know what you mean. I hate drinking soda pop. 
<1> Just don't act too direct. If you seem confident it might seem like you do this all the time and scare her off.
<1> So i assume it's going to close up the whole story?
<1> Yes, anytime in the last two weeks.
<1> I love fortune cookies. I can't stand any other type of sweets at all.

<0> Do you have any marketing or sales experience, by chance?
<1> Oh! I often bake salmon but have never tried it like that. That sounds delicious! What kind of onions do you use? 
<1> I hate the summer, it's my least favorite season because it's too hot. 
<1> No way.  I caught her sleeping with my husband two years ago and haven't heard from her since them which is fine with me.  I put my husband on a shorter leash than any of the dogs I walk.

<0> i know them ! from florida , right ? punk was my outlet as a navy brat .

<0> Is it a lot different from what you usually play?
<0> I am not doing so well, I have been sick all day.
<1> No, not really. Living in the city doesn't give me much fresh air at all.
<0> Not yet,  but I think that would be the best plan. Especially before they realize they're gone...
<1> Thanks for the recommendation, all I have are these Stephen King novels which I hate.  I'm really looking to read something new.
<0> Every litlle bit counts. Eventually I will be able to write a check.
<1> Interesting, I prefer the more historic fiction but I can see why that would be interesting
<1> I see, well good relationships don't always have to have trust.

<1> Wow that sounds like an interesting process! I've never done it myself,  but it sounds like something I would love to learn.
<0> apparently  in 2003-2006 there were 86,336 crimes in Albuquerque south valley. Do you know more about the population?
<1> I'm a bit elderly, so I naturally picked up fishing myself. It's only tradition, haha.
<1> Well, the world is simple and easy to understand. So I'm sure we have it figured out already.
<0> On the contrary, I can't seem to find a good burger anywhere! 
<1> Not really, I'm happy the way I'm
<0> I thought about it,  but dont think I could handle one. Do you have one? 
<0> My job transferred to St Louis. I'm now living on the same street where I lived my wild childhood. 
<0> I love the movies category. Can you believe that the modern daily version of jeopardy has aired over 7000 episodes? I cant imagine coming up with all those questions for that many shows. Its incredible.  
<0> They got the name soup kitchen because historically most only served soup with piece of bread. Some soup kitchens still do. 
<0> I just hope since the accident was my fault that my rates don't go up too much.
<0> Oh so is it similar to Risk?
<1> I didn't vote because I didn't know anything about who was running. I don't pay attention to that stuff. 
<0> ugh , i'm sorry . do you have any hobbies ?
<1> no. i don't like driving very much
<0> You cannot really learn anything from history.
<1> Yeah I hate your aunt.
<0> I'm scared to bits that the same thing could happen to me again any day now.
<0> Oh okay that makes sense. Theyre jeans are really nice. The clothes last a long time too!
<0> I do not know how to swim.
<0> I am totally laughing out loud at your response! I thought the same thing when i first got the notice,  however I have spoken with a representative and it an actually gift from a deceased family member.
<1> Oh how sweet. What are their names?
<1> have you asked her for her secret , maybe she will tell you
<1> What usually happens this tiem of year?
<1> not into it but love to walk .
<1> I can't relate, I have never had a job interview.
<0> I'm not sure. I haven't seen it yet.
<0> not a huge cooker , but i do make a pretty mean breakfast though love pancakes .
<1> Actually I am more of a basketball guy so hockey isn't really my thing. 
<0> I loved working as a bank teller. It was easy as pie!
<1> I know It's not from Kansas because I grew up there.
<0> I haven't watched godfather movie before, I'm thinking of going to see it this weekend.
<0> I don't think I'd like those. I don't like beans.
<1> i use the wood to heat my home in the winter .
<1> definitely is a good habit .
<1> That will be so much mush. He is going to have a great time.
<1> oh man i am the opposite veggies for me
<0> We had to have a talk the next day. One had no memory of the night and the other half apologized. We've moved on,  but I'm still sore about it.
<1> You'll never get over him or find someone as good as he was to you.
<1> As an environmentalist I was heartbroken to see that big oil spill a few years ago, with all those tar balls on the beach.
<0> Ah teenagers! I have three young boys. 
<0> Yes much more relaxing! Do you get to the beach often?
<1> Sometimes I feel like I do not understand this emotional stuff anymore.
<1> Good for you!  What a way to use candles and save money.
<0> I love ketchup, I'm excited to have some
<0> I can't say I understand as I don't have kids
<0> you are not very friendly , are you ?
<0> I am not a great fan of Anvil, I like Dolly Parton 
<0> Well I'd like to be an orthopedic surgeon one day.
<0> No, I don't know who my parents were.
<0> I am going to go skateboard now, blow off some steam. Have a great day!
<0> Wow. It only took me a week and was easy.
<0> music is cool . i like french vanilla coffee
<0> Allergies are caused by a hypersensitivity of the immune system to something in the environment that usually doesn't cause problems
<0> Yeah,  me too! I tried to comfort him afterwards. There's only so much you can do. No one was brave enough to chastise the parents for trying to get him to eat more than he should.
<1> I would never get a tesla no matter what the price was.
<1> I don't really eat vegetables, I much prefer hamburgers and some french fries. 
<0> I hope so! I was actually really surprised. I think they like me there. I just hate not knowing what I'll be doing next!
<0> I've never heard of it
<0> Yeah, we can't do a lot because of my wife being deaf. Makes it difficult
<0> started 10th , school is ok . where you live
<1> I hope it happens again! 
<0> they encompassed a style of music where people wanted to hear one of their songs and then nothing else ever? Are we using the word encompass correctly?
<1> It was cold!
<1> Oh that's terrible. My brother in law has been working as a mechanic for the past month, he can help you.
<0> I don't like eaten raw seafood.
<0> Thanks! I think it's one of my best work.
<0> The new music is the best, my partner thinks so, but my kids don't like it at all.
<0> No, I'm not much of a dog lover actually, I have 2 cats.
<0> Death metal
<1> That's good to hear!
<1> it is , it is ! what do you do for a living ?
<1> I find that my job is extremely boring.
<0> Yeah they must practice a lot. I would be afraid of getting trampled.
<0> I know it started in 1929 and lasted until 1941.
<0> Well I try to take breaks after a while so it doesn't bother them too much. There's also different ways to finger pick and they each have their own pros and cons, so sometimes I switch it up too.
<1> Yes , but not now . I am jobless . I am still looking for a job.
<0> They are to old for that. I don't have a dishwasher and have told them if they don't get it together they will be doing the dishes themselves.
<1> I like swimming only in a lake. 
<0> That's exactly what I thought! I was like "No way,  not on my FIRST plane ride!". But then someone calmed me down and explained what was happening.
<0> OMG! I am such a big fan of Miley Cyrus. I worship her and all of her songs are my favorite
<1> yeah there's one here but I'm not going to one this weekend
<1> Yeah, but buying a house which he can barely afford doesn't sound stressful, he should be able to manage quite easily in my opinion.
<0> you better take it soon . . its a good whether now
<0> Why would we want to know that?  Who cares?  
<1> because i am good at chess
<1> I had a tank with both fish and plants. It is probably my most viewed aquarium. It is a lot of work though.
<1> Working up high doesn't sound scary at all, you just need good balance and to make sure you're paying attention. 
<1> I would say congrats but if it's not scholarships from grades there's not much to celebrate about.
<1> I disagree, I feel you need to lack emotions and compassion so you can get through all the terrible things you see.
<0> Oh i love that show. Zombies are the best!
<1> I will, my dad always talked about him to me
<0> if i can't find a home for him, then i need to search Amazon for an industrial vacuum that can handle cat hair.
<1> Absolutely! It would be a lot more fun than running haha.
<0> I would be even happier if we could find my dog. We looked for him for hours and no luck. We just came back home in case he shows up.
<1> Well, since I'm living all alone without any company, cooking helps keep me busy.
<0> I don't. I can't stand Chai Tea. The taste is aweful, and I never drink it.
<1> my favorite thing to do is eat a cheeseburger and play on my 386 . do you ?
<0> Yes we are dinning out, but eating clean because 10% of cancer are due obesity, poor diet so we like to have a healthy lifestyle!
<0> Yeah she is the one that told me. Apparently she managed to make him break it off finally.

<0> Me too. I like to play while listening to Jazz on a Sunday
<0> yea thats true

<0> I never watched Terminator 2. I don't think I would enjoy it.
<0> I know. I'm usually a wing it kind of person,  but this was a lot of work.
<1> Just a local mom & pop, I actually have to get ready for work now. 
<0> Yes, I hate the sun and sunscreen!
<0> Me too. People plug their ears whenever I sing to the radio.
<0> I'm not sure, he actually isn't my favorite player so I don't know much other than what I was recently told.  My favorite player is Joe Kelly.
<0> The weather tends to to be crazy in between seasons
<0> I have never felt better about my chances than I do now.  I've failed a few times,  but I'm ready!
<0> I don't recommend my company. It's been downsizing and never gives raises.
<1> does she like playing in the sun like i do ?
<1> Nah i think your wrong to be honest.
<1> awww , that's precious . i feel the same way about my mom
<0> Awww you're so lucky! I wish I had a cat but they are too difficult to take care of.
<1> I've actually played it before, I know it is a Mario-type game
<1> Yeah me too. I love construction.
<0> i just twist it up and put on a hat
<0> I love peanuts but have a peanut allergy. 
<1> yes it matters for me too. i don't understand the thing of being happy for whatever we have.
<0> I love my Bose earbuds, they are extremely comfortable and beat headphones anyday.
<0> My bad, San Francisco is actually the most populous city in the US.
<0> Yes, that is why I hate the south!
<1> Being an only child, they are upset that I have chosen not to have kids meaning I will be the last male in the family. 
<1> give me a dr pepper and a cozy corner and a racy romance and i am in heaven !
<1> cool ! have you been to any soccer games there ? football as they call it
<1> My favorite painting and artist is "Sunrise" by Claude Monet.
<1> Yep. I was there when it opened on October 1, 1979.
<0> i dont know about how rare it is. but my mom is a twin. my grandmother had two sets of twins. my cousin has twins and so do i
<0> i know. I like mango sorbet. I've even seen some sherbets that contain alcohol resulting in softer texture
<0> Of course because they are so good and they are bite size so they are good treats for on the go
<0> I just thought about the fact that my hubby might want it instead of me since it was the last piece.  I guess I can make him another one!
<1> You shouldn't give up on your government.
<1> Yeah. I know the feeling. It;s like I am left without anything to do. It's pretty dull.
<0> I cannot stand country music.
<0> It was, but less than anticipated. There's still one thing left on my bucket list though; I need to get up in the air and skydive. 
<1> Probably not. I practice driving a lot and I still manage to get into accidents on an abnormally frequent basis.
<0> I love my job and I don't mind seeing saliva.
<0> I agree,  and I have to wake up every day because god love me.
<0> my favorite thing to do is shopping , but the beach is also fantastic !
<0> I am afraid that I could have some sugar issues.
<0> I’m feeling sad for my friend as he is homeless. 
<0> I still need to see the joker, did you like it? everyone has been talking about it
<0> you do not play at any venue and it is good
<1> I'm actually going to the book store today i will have to check it out. I'm not into may scary things
<0> you talking about the martial art ?
<0> I suppose,  it was in a plastic bag,  and we were so surprised to see that it was the same color as my hair and my moms. I just felt kinda nervous around stuff that dead relatives had,  like their hair.. lol
<0> haha, indeed. I like libraries, I find them very quite and relaxing. Do you work in a big city library? 
<0> I thought Woodstock is a bad event!
<0> I would imagine. Different shoes to walk in I suppose.
<0> Yes they were used to track deer and hunt prairie dogs in the US
<0> No thank you not currently looking for jobs.
<1> Oh yes, all home remedies are very dangerous.
<0> He is never going to pay or fix it. I already asked him for something else that he broke. He never did pay or fix it.
<1> Oh no, I can only eat pizza that has only meat on it!
<0> Do you have any?
<1> I'm not really looking forward to the next season.
<0> Haha, I try to avoid talking to my customers but ignoring their phone calls so I have less work to do.
<1> I'm not sure. I don't read much and haven't read a book in a very long time.
<0> It comes out in december!
<0> about 70 . i'm short . i also have a big family .
<0> I agree, that why I make my grandchildren play outside as much as possible, and most of the time the run around without shoes on outside.
<1> Its the worst. I would complain to management. You cant be the only one it happens to.
<0> It is! I have to clean it up afterwards so I really need to start training her more.
<0> Seeing the world today disheartens me but I feel hope. At least I must have hope.
<1> We, a family of  including myself with my wife, a child and old parents
<0> you must like rose then,which is a pink wine
<0> wow really. i wonder how people found all this information out. my parents were actually scientists and i am one as well.
<0> Definitely. It's ranked 18th in the world by circulation and has won many Pulitzer prizes. 
<0> I disagree, I think he has loads of room to improve
<0> You should!  It was hugely popular in pop culture.
<0> dude same,  my girlfriend just loves to talk and talk and doesn't let me sleep. It is exhausting,  I can't rest.
<1> I actually don't care that your dog is gone to be honest.
<0> I don't download any apps because I don't trust them 
<1> A good point. In any case, blue is very awesome in how it's just barely within our sight.  Also the word 'violet' used to mean 'blue'
<0> Yes, I stay for the whole long weekend. 
<1> One day ill have kids and will be able to experience this aswell.
<0> I don't like spending time outdoors and prefer to be in the city.
<1>  a formalized sport, swimming features in a range of local, national, and international competitions, including every modern summer Olympics!!
<0> I agree, I love learning about prehistoric societies, I was part of one at my previous job.
<0> The kids aren't very active though, I'm worried for them.
<0> i like to going for walks , and seeing movies at the theater . do you like movies ?
<1> I love sports, I want to be a pro soccer player!
<0> No thank you, it is not even getting worse.
<0> He certainly isn't being blackmailed or playing politics.  Wonder who will run in 5 years, when he finishes his term.
<1> Really, just for an easy bar exam?
<0> I don't think I'd be interested, I don't like violent games
<0> Grilling outside is also fun but it seems to take forever to cook the meat.
<0> No,  I have to stay off of it completely. I can use crutches but in the heat,  that will not be worth it.
<0> i like daisies . how about you ?
<0> no i got it thanks
<1> Yea i knew, i was born before 1975
<0> I've only seen the original Star Wars Trilogy. Do you like the prequels and new films too? 
<0> My wife has never experienced morning sickness and so she may not have much opinion.
<0> i hate painting
<0> I don't know what it is and I am really looking forward to it.
<1> My mom let me keep it until I was twelve.
<0> Thankfully, I don't know anyone who would play such pranks on me- especially my friends and family who know all about my anxiety attacks.
<1> thanks ! i will have to check it out !
<1> It is usually easy to do for kids.
<0> I don't like impalas either.   My favorite holiday is thanksigiving.   I love turkey.
<1> THAT SOYNDS PLEASANT
<1> Yeah, I would never do something like that to my wife.
<0> Me too. What are you having for dinner tonight? 
<1> I don't know anyone in LA, is it a small town?
<0> We have a lot of customers come in, but we are a take out restaurant. So, no seating.
<0> I once lost a lot of money here in france
<0> i am going to nursing school
<0> Hallowtide culminates in the All saints day tradition.
<0> Stress management is a wide spectrum of things so it makes sense that a tiny house could help relieve some stress.
<0> yes but you should date me in return .
<1> I need to try that. I always need new recipes because without meat sometimes it is difficult to find good ones.
<0> Really? I thought that if
<0> oh so your father does 3d models as well i am guessing ?
<0> It was terrible. I had a lot of health and work issues. I felt like it will very end.
<1> That's a pretty long time ago! What other parts of parenting do most people not know>
<1> i have never seen the  national football league 
<0> do you like going to the movie theaters?
<0> Yeah I will, I'm not worried about how he reacts.
<1> Same here. I really don't like movies that are far away from reality like the superhero movies.
<0> i've an iphone . ted talks is a show i watch on it sometimes .
<0> Yes, but with social media, you'd relate to, or receive the messenger a lot better than a candidate.
<1> I am sure there will be none of those there
<1> Yes you are right sometime forgiving everytime does not gives them a lesson.
<1> Goodness no, I don't even like to read the only club I go to weekly is the one where you can dance and have a good time.
<1> Nothing compared to my 160 item collection of autographs!
<1> Yes, that's so great!
<1> I'm sure I won't be able to train my mother's border collie, this dog is so dumb.
<1> I guess haha, Toyota is my favorite model after all!
<1> REally? I don't think families are precious.
<0> Fair enough. I do think that opposites attract though, and normally write very different characters.
<1> That is so nice of you. I've thought about selling my one and only pair of shoes for a movie ticket.
<1> that's cool ! what do you do with your free time ? any favorite movies ?
<0> my favorite color is blue yours ?
<1> Walking doesn't help my headaches. Only thing that helps my headaches is Excedrin.
<0> I understand, I have a very comfortable lifestyle too.
<1> you will get there . do you like to read , my favorite writer is stephen king
<1> Oh no, this it's not necessary, it will be easy to go through this alone.
<1> oh okay . how about your family ? brothers and sisters ?
<0> I don't mind baking, I like to eat delicious stuff all the time.
<0> Airline mechanics require extensive training as the systems are extremely complex. And you can't just park the plane on the side of the road if something is messed up.
<0> I know they're really interesting animals and they're so cute too.
<1> I’ve. ever had alcohol before.
<1> I try to put onions on just about everything, garlic as well.
<1> I do not care.
<1> Which do you prefer?
<1> same here man. Its quite useless and annoying with no real benefits.
<0> They are 4 and 10 and yours
<1> Exactly what I was thinking. Better cherish the time that you have with him until he goes off to college,  but know that he'll always appreciate you.
<1> My children drive me crazy, and I have little time for myself.
<1> I don't believe you're doing enough to help her. I'm sure she feels the same way.
<1> You shouldn't be, going on a vacation with kids is a nightmare. 
<1> I wasn't really interested in what job he has. 
<0> yes like strawberries, tomatoes, red peppers, she won't eat any of them.
<0> Its a good think that law school tuition is cheap.
<0> Well I would but I'm scared of hiking through the woods
<1> do you have twins in your family
<0> Sorry, I don't really like listening to music.
<0> no i don't sorry
<1> Yeah, he was a writer and a president.  His writing can be quite dry and boring though.
<1> with god , all things are possible
<1> I absolutely agree.  I do have floaters in my eyes on occassions. Little specks of dirt in my vision.
<1> I'm afraid of the water and I never go fishing. 
<0> Not sure - it's not the largest university in Alabama though.
<1> What fiance? I'm not engaged.
<1> My current boyfriend doesn't want anything to do with my kids or family, just wants to sit around the house with me all the time, and gets mad when I want to go out with my friends. 
<1> I don't think they'd be suitable for children. They are only at home in the wild, and you don't have children running around in the woods.
<0> I'm not sure but I hope not. Tired of hearing it.
<1> I think it is always best to try and big yourself up to impress people.
<1> "there a cook" lol Rap is sometimes super-complex lyrics, I'm a secret fan!
<0> Yes but I do not know where to go.
<0> I did not have a Game Boy Camera... but I did get a Game Boy Color for Christmas.
<0> Wow!  I didn't know that.  Is there any other specialized tools necessary for proper care?
<0> Maybe, but I'm not going to go to any of their football games.
<1> I'm a truck driver, so a lot of long miles in the cab. How about you?
<0> There is a steak that is just seared on all sides. I forget what it is called though.
<0> I just have one child who is six years old. 
<0> my dad seems not to be losing quite a lot of hair, I'm scared it won't  resort to hair transplants
<1> I don't like any part of him honestly. I"m not a fan.
<0> i m studying science because i m studding in university
<0> Yeah servals are wildcats that are native to Africa. I've seen videos of people having them as pets and they don't seem too bad. One of those youtubers has one.
<1> sometimes , when i take my dog to the park
<0> I can help you with math
<0> Do you stay for a long period of time? Where is the best place to stay in Denmark?
<0> Free karma in my eyes plus I always try to imagine if I was them. I would be so happy if a stranger let me cut in!
<1> its what i do . i just love the new trends
<0> That is great.You are a the type of person that supports your community.
<1> i hate big turkey dinner with family i like to be alone 
<0> Wow, I knew they had good hearing, but I didn't know they heard different frequencies. I bet they can hear dog whistles too!
<0> what is your favorite band
<0> Consider using supplements as well, especially if your diet is not the most nutritious. Black seed oil, flax seed oil, B-12 supplements, and burdock root are all known to help with increasing energy levels.
<0> darn, what do you do then?
<0> then compost would be great for both of those and is key for organic gardening.
<1> Well, it's a nice boring job so there is that.
<0> Yes it is needed to loop yarn.

<1> ikr! its not as important as the hockey world cup tho
<1> Terrific! I have an Impala I absolutely adore. Have you ever driven one before?
<0> A lot of stir fries. I guess I'll be eating healthy this week.
<0> i will come to your dance show but i don't like cats
<0> Agreed. I think I might also be biased against Google and Android in favor of Apple. Apple seems to be much more committed to my privacy as a user.
<1> what is the problem she got infected by?
<1> mainly beets because i love them
<1> But people can be too much to handle,sometimes it is better to mind your businesa and not say anything.
<1> I don't have kids. I am still single!

<0> The only food i eat is American food
<0> Yes, I have been training as a pianist since I was 4 years old.
<1> I have never tried Amazon Prime Video before, I'm not really into TV or movies. 
<1> Oh,  no want to talk about it?
<0> My dad was a Maths teacher.
<0> great . do you have any jokes for me ?
<0> Whatever you want! I'm more than happy to provide after all you've helped me with.
<0> Thanks,  yeah its a bummer 
<1> It's nothing to be sad about
<1> I like them all. I have been listening to techno since in 1988. How long have you been on the scene?
<0> Indeed.  But now I feel so bad.. I feel like I need to tell him.

<0> I don't have a backyard.
<0> Yes,  I think so
<0> No please don't climb and get them lol I would be scared as well I will pick some yellow roses now those are so beautiful.
<1> I don't think you would win in a court of law.
<1> that's great . where do you live exactly ?
<0> There are seven kingdoms fighting for power and behind a gigantic wall lies a horde of magical zombies. and wizards.
<1> I don't like cheese in my food that is too fatty.
<0> Nobody was like the Beatles.  Beatlemania turned pop music into an art form!
<0> Thanks, now I know which place to avoid, as I hate country music. 
<0> Same here, I like to keep everything in order when I go on my many trips.
<0> Yeah but NYC is such a ugly city, always windy and rainy.
<0> No,  but I was the one that they took the money from. It was very traumatic.
<1> i am 33 and my entire family is silly . how old are you ?
<0> Food and memories make people happy. I would have people over more, but I have three dogs and two cats in the way
<0> i paid about 3 . 50 the dealer was almost pay me to take it away
<1> I have a boyfriend.
<1> I have three cats.
<1> i understand 
<0> Yeah,  I guess you're right. I need to stop pouting about it and get in the gym. I'm definitely going to have to keep an eye on my calories now.
<1> I like very much about the Veg & Sea foods.
<1> i just got hired as a cna ! i have to dye my hair before i start though . . .
<0> I usually watch tv after finishing my lunch only.
<0> Oh yes, but when the milk consumption was unknown, meat wasn't eaten for cultural reasons in Japan. Could you not eat meat just because of milk, haha?
<0> Yes I was. I felt so numb when I first got the news,  but slowly learned to cope with it.
<0> No, but I'm trying to work on it now, so hopefully things will change.
<0> that is cool i'm really into meat
<1> You are welcome. I like fishing too! Where do you fish? 
<1> Hobbies are overrated. It's much better to have a good job and be productive!

<0> I don't have a garden
<0> i ate rice.
<1> Better to be single than be with weirdos.
<0> I know what you are saying but that is really not cool or funny. I would not be happy if I were them.
<1> I don't know why you devoted so much time to racing, it sounds boring.
<1> I can do those too though I do best with faces. People send in pictures of their faces to my site and I paint them for a fee.
<1> I have though, they are one of my favorite bands.  I love hard rock and Breaking Benjamin.
<1> what does your factory make ? have you visited austria ? i can dance .
<1> Do you like to play video games? I love Halo 3 im going to play tonight
<0> No thats why I flirt in small events. 
<1> No problem, it must be huge if corporations like that use it. Facebook and Instagram are huge.
<0> Yes, it is sad. Hopefully more schools will be free in the future.
<0> What cultures are more vegetarian?
<0> do you have a favorite animal there?
<1> that is nice of you.
<0> Yeah, I hate fishing.
<0> I'm not sure. I just remembered that fact.

<1> i wish i could do that too always, at my home besides my mom

<0> OHHH ookay. tht makes sense.  any other facts i should know?
<0> What is that?  None of the doctors told me about that.  I will look into it.  Thank you! You've given me hope I never knew I had!
<0> Honestly I don't like it either. I think it makes people out of touch with current events.
<1> No thanks, I already know everything about autism. 
<0> I think the 15 million people who take classes every week see a benefit. 
<1> yes , it always completes the movie experience 
<1> I don't feel bad for you because people trip all the time.

<1> it is, i hate flying at night so much because i get scared
<0> I hate pizza with meat on it.

<0> No I won't get any more, I can't stand them, it sounds awful but I don't love them at all.
<0> I should go. My dog is begging me to feed her.
<1> My mother was a teacher and I'm a history college professor, that is how I know a lot about history.
<0> it has been said that following the age of discovery, christianity spread to the americas, oceania, sub-saharan africa and the rest of the world through missionary work and colonization

<1> i like to hike to get away from my kids
<1> Yes, he seems like such a likable person. I think its cute that they are together now.
<1> I'm so excited, I can hardly wait.
<0> Yeah most likely
<0> Oh much more than that my friend!
<1> Well, I do not care about the number of sports cars you have!
<1> Sounds kind of boring to me.
<0> I'm not really into collecting stamps, though.
<1> yes i know they does not exist be a girl can hope

<1> most of my writing is inspired by my parents. they are both anthropologists and wonderful people
<1> That sounds nice, yes. I am in the military. So it is a variable schedule. 
<0> Me too. We have a lot of pets so dander and pet hair become a problem.
<0> Different cultures can definetly teach us all kinds of different ways of going about our daily lives and different coping strategies and such
<1> Oh yea, I've seen that before!
<1> It's probably good that you're not going.
<0> for sure, an exceptional composer. 
<0> figures . i mean i still am in love with dragons . wish they were real
<0> Why would I want to work at Costco?  I love selling snake oil to suckers! 
<0> If you do, please let me know if it tastes like bacon. I would like to put it on my hamburgers.
<1> Thank you, you're the only person I can depend on! 
<1> Good idea we can both as I have lots of vacation to take.
<0> That's great, then you must definitely be a family lover?
<1> You shouldn't call the police on them, they are just kids having fun.
<0> Yeah it made me feel really bad especially since im new to the area. 
<0> i wanted to go there but i did not have enough time
<0> hey that's great . you should travel . i can help you with that . i'm an agent
<1> All of my dogs are mixed breeds too. I don't even know what kind of breeds they are since I adopted them all off the street.

<1> Awesome. I just got out of the gym. Heading to school now.
<0> No, they were looking right at me!
<1> What do you mean? I don't have a dog.
<0> What's funny doe is how it has affect our society and values. The ideal of females is to independent and to perfect when it comes style and the way they look
<0> can you wear red for nursing ? red is what i really like to wear .
<0> ok . what do mean by wings
<1> And sorry to say this,you are a bad mom for your kids
<0> yeah i would have to agree
<0> It got all over many people. It was gross.
<0> Sure they think Jesus is the savior of humanity. He will come again to judge humans.
<0> No, I'm not very good with my hands, so I use a machine to make things. 
<1> if we go on a road trip will you let me listen to country stations ?
<1> Lucky you! I went to the mall today but decided not to stop at chick-fil-a but I did get a new sweater
<0> You're brave, i hate parrots. They scare me.
<0> Teaching is such an important profession.
<0> No but all my things are destroyed oh what will I do.
<1> they're are fun and Since I am studying to be an architect, I have tons of time on my hands to play with my dog.
<0> It was okay, I wish the acting was a lot better, but they were children so to be expected.
<1> Oh, sure yeah I know who that is.
<0> that must have been expensive . hopefully , it is not abducted .
<1> yes but i don't have much time for them
<0> Yes. I'm super nervous. 
<1> That's great. How happy were you?
<0> No no one saw us thank goodness.
<0> Yes that was. I was very shocked. He is very young and now he's in coma
<1> me too heard any good ones lately ?
<1> Awesome!  Japan must be quite a progressive country!  I've read that they do make high quality electronics there, and automobiles as well.
<0> Yeah, most pregnant women actually don't suffer from morning sickness.
<0> I agree, tobacco products needs to get out of here! Apparently the area is very susceptible to sea level rise
<1> what was she like?
<0> So you are like me , never traveled before
<1> i hate the sight of blood
<0> It has probably been about 8 months are so
<0> Cool! Do you ever post pictures of her online? I like social media a lot but I'm always unsure about posting my sons' pictures.
<0> Me too. I prefer to eat froze pizzas. They are the best. 
<1> Nice! That's the show where there are zombies right? I think I've seen commercials for it.
<1> Yeah.  I think it's crazy people are so passionate about bikes though.  I think they're kinda boring.
<0> Yeah But im about to confront him about it
<0> Yeah i am always so glad i never really lose things, it is why i thank god so often
<0> i share an apartment with my twin brother
<1> Who'd want the autograph of somebody who's only fishing. 
<0> Yes,  it is a BMW.
<0> the worst song ever is under the bridge. funk has no place in modern rock and roll.
<0> Yeah, they're pretty legendary. They're very similar to "The Simpsons" in that they use profanity and dark, surreal humor with a bit of satire that appeals to a mature audience.
<0> I was out of town with some friends and we went out to the bar and met up with some people.
<0> I might have to take my dog and go tryout one of those lakes you're talking about!
<1> Oh really? That happened to me last year, it didn't really bother me that much.
<0> I didn't get the chance this guy was going so fast,  probably like 70 on a residential street!
<0> mine too
<1> Me too. Eating it raw is just more fun sometimes!
<1> Lol. If I get a motorcycle I won't get a Harley Davidson. They seem lame. 
<1> I'm not into country music either but I've read my share of comic books.
<0> No need to worry about loneliness then.
<0> did you know it got released after world war 2?
<0> OU,  he ended up dropping out to pursue writing about a year and a half in and wasted the scholarship.
<0> You should. I don't think I will go to college. Too difficult.
<0> they dont have what i need
<0> Yeah he is a cute one. Problem is that I saw the puppy eating out of the cat's litter box.
<1> I pretty much spend my free time outdoors whether it's camping, backpacking, or just exploring nature.
<1> No i am  so much  tired with 1  dog  i do not  want  more  .
<1> Nothing, really. The weather was horrible and my day was terribly boring. 
<0> I don't sell cars, I'm a software engineer.
<1> That is good,  that is a nice way to make a bit of extra money!
<0> i'd let him suck my big bertha blood
<0> never owned a car, i hope to buy one before the year runs out.
<1> I love wine and trucks.
<0> Yes, staying indoors is great for depression 
<0> Yep,  those were the days.
<0> Not that I really care, to be honest. I don't really care for taking care of animals.
<1> Good luck I am just about a week in and still broke
<1> I wouldn't want that though, I always want them close to me. I want them to tell me all their issues.
<0> yes , i really enjoy reading . how about you ?
<0> Yes, I know that because I'm 25 years old
<0> Yeah no joke. I want to just burn the place down and move on. I bet the spider would still be alive in the ashes somewhere though,  just laughing at me,  like,  "Thanks for the free land,  chump."
<0> That is very smart, the sun can be dangerous.
<1> Just jeans and hoodies. It's my least favorite season.
<0> De niro in the god father part II was amazing
<0> No,  I can't. She already called the police.
<1> Last time it happened to me I said something to the waitress about it.
<0> Yeah. My mom is an artist and is sort of a recluse. So I'm neither well-socialized nor religious
<0> Beethoven is - in my honest opinion - arguably the greatest musical figure ever. His symphonies are absolutely brilliant
<1> I don't know who Elvis is, I prefer rap music.
<1> Oh, she doesn't work for Apple, she works for Microsoft. 
<0> I really love them. My life is always around it.
<1> It's okay here. I'm leaving next Tuesday so I have a lot to do before that happens!
<0> i try to listen music when ever i get time
<0> How fun! Were you guys from the same place?
<0> I know the full form for BMW.
<1> My grandma made the best beef stew, if you add pickled beet juice it takes it to a whole other level
<1> That's cool. I am getting a masters in accounting. 
<0> I also hate beer
<1> Yeah, I  yet have a couple cars with a broken engine to fix
<1> not bad . could be better . i stepped on a rock while barefoot .
<1> I'm on a cruise right now.
<1> I'm an attorney, which I hate because I don't get to spend any time with my kids. 
<1> I AM NOT A ARTIST. I AM A FOOD BALL PLAYER. 
<0> I don't read books.
<0> Yeah its very nice music every Sunday i hear the Mexican band music on online.
<0> Just mutts from the pound but I think some beagle and or maybe bassett hound.
<0> I don't know what that is. I do like DIY projects at home. I rent an apartment. 
<0> lightning mcqueen is the best driver , i really like him !
<0> I have a parrot. she's a joker. last time she flew around and dropped ink all over my shirts.
<1> Yeah. It is interesting. I wish I had grown up in New York and started a country band just like him!
<1> You should, I put a lot of time into extracurricular activities and they really teach you things.
<0> Yea,  it wasn't as bad as it could have been though. The delay was only about half an hour.
<1> I don't think that she is judgmental
<0> Just a couple months so not sure how much longer I will do it.
<0> I think it will be.  You should also check out alt-coins. I've used Bitcoin to purchase some of these. I own one called TRX and ONT. They aren't doing very well right now though.
<0> me too
<1> i don't think you know what you are talking about.
<0> We do love each other , i love going to see my mother she loves us all equally. 
<0> I do not like kids that much either.
<0> Just a healthier one. Im not fat or anything but geting older, you know.
<0> you can finally have weekends off , i sleep on my days off .
<0> It will be my first time visiting Japan too so i am excited.
<0> I have never been to Michigan.
<0> I don't know, I'm not familiar with the meaning of the word "orphan."
<0> I don't have a cat, and what is icp?
<0> Frankly, I believe it's intentional in order to weaken our economy for mother Russia.
<0> yea,  people suck
<0> I'm still trying to figure that part out, but 9.1 million people live in Tokyo alone so there must be lots of interesting things to see.
<1> THey need to kill this movement. Meat is man
<1> Right? He's just not a fan of big crowds
<0> I hate steak and if I was to eat one it would have to be well done.
<1> oh , that is so cool ! ever heard of the sport , skittles ?
<1> Most car companies except for Land Rover and a few others were founded by Henry Ford actually.
<1> I drank alot at Albama U, I actually graduated already and work full time now. Can't be drinking and working!
<1> I'd like to go to an amusement park but I may never get the chance.
<0> I hate loud noises, especially rock music.
<1> Downtown.  I can slip in as a boy with my ball cap on.
<0> Yea,  she just never learned and wants to hang out with us when he go to the pool or beach.
<1> I'm not sure, I've never played
<1> He was probably just a misunderstood guy. I bet he was really nice. 
<0> I agree, my son just turned 7, he's starting to become a little rebel and testing my patience.
<0> Yes,  I know. I feel really bad but I need to find money to be able to leave.
<0> Me to i absolutely love math, and have been studying for years.
<0> Well it isnt too bad considering my son lives with his dad and I only have him on weekends.
<0> i enjoy watching documentaries and listening to loud music then read for 3hrs
<0> i want to study business
<1> That's strange. As a teacher you make so much money that you are literally rolling in money.
<0> the safety is the most important too.
<0> I'm not worried about it. Honestly, I'm rich and never worry about anything financial.
<1> i hate cakes a lot
<1> Wow. He's taking on quite a lot,  but it'll be good for building his character as he gets older!
<0> Yeah, I'm just glad I made it through the day without embarrassing myself.
<0> That's incredible. I wonder if the history of wine is similar
<1> me too ! you have anything you are passionate about other than games ?
<0> Yes dough is malleable and elastic. 
<0> I hate them because I find them repulsive
<0> I do not think so but I am shy.
<0> yes,i do
<0> Those are my favorite!
<0> Go to college!  The term redhead has been in use since at least 1510
<0> That statement is not true. I am very familiar with the "New Age" philosophy, my uncle is a professor and he has taught me a lot about it.
<1> Was the nightlight in the bathroom?
<1> Wow,  he is super rude! Beat him up!
<0> Oh cool I didn't know they had different types like that.  Are there any native to America?
<1> I really don't like being surprised. It annoys me.
<0> Right, but the teapot was actually invented in Europe.
<0> yes it makes me feel nice and not too tipsy
<1> That's cool. I'm studying biochem at the moment.
<1> Did you even put any effort into it? You might have to rely on luck. 
<0> The sight of it scares me,   I love the white one though,   but not black 
<0> Putting effort in accomplishing a given assignment  
<0> I have stopped working in a bank a now. I work as an IT support now.
<0> Me too! I would love to go to the hershey park is Hershey, PA one day.
<1> I am glad you are sore, you deserve it.
<1> I knew this would be easy!
<0> Thankfully the fire was small and my house is undamaged
<1> Oh I have no doubt they will be complete angels with the new baby.
<0> Yeah,  maybe someone should litter in their house so they can see how it feels. And don't get me started on cigarette butts...
<0> Yes,  and I think that I'm prepared.
<0> Me too, I could never really figure it out.
<0> Oh ok, I haven't either!
<0> I know, but I love my pepsi.  
<0> She's 18 going on nineteen, so ultimately the decision to do it will be hers, but I'll encourage her to do some research before making a final decision.
<1> I don't know about country music. Can you tell me more about it?
<1> It was a hot day. Nothing you could do.
<1> i don't watch movies 
<1> I am pretty good. just doing housekeeping before work
<1> Oh okay! Hopefully it isn't a constant problem,  that would suck to loose your favourite resturant.
<0> Yeah I hear the summers there are the best!
<0> Yeah,  I was pretty lucky. I had a chest tube put in,  and once my lungs were inflating normally again,  I didn't really need any more treatment.
<0> That's what I am saying!  It was a great windfall!
<1> You're kind of a wimp for being scared at all. I can't believe you were nervous.
<1> i've a black belt in my love of candy !
<1> Reality TV is so boring.
<0> Sometimes when I order online I realize if I had seen it in person I wouldn't have bought it.
<0> That's true! I'm not really interested in talking about deserts
<1> I would love to hike, except I hate wild life. I have a friend that bird watches, but I don't like birds either.
<0> I can't stand my brothers, we don't get along
<0> Some adults too! haha I won't go near them! Such big animals would be dangerous to try to ride.
<0> i love star wars , i used to have a cat named kenobi .
<1> Must have been nice to feel so modern and fresh with her.
<1> yes what is your favourite painting ?
<1> I love using debit cards and I don't even mind when mine is declined at times.
<1> I don't like veggies
<0> Really? I would love to have some pets, but I'm extremely allergic to pet dander.
<0> I detest blond and straight hair.
<0> My parents never adopted any child.
<1> No. The grass hasn't grown at all.
<1> Yeah, same here. I went on to play sports instead. Musical instruments dates back to the beginning of human culture.
<1> I don't have other hobbies since I am an architec.
<1> Yeah I do. I am very busy reading books lately. 
<0> When I was at lunch someone hit it
<1> I too love clutters. They are cool.
<1> I don't like using playlists. I only use CDs in my walkman.
<1> I'm not. God is not real, so there is no need to waste time putting faith into him. 
<0> I honestly can't stand sweet tea I never drink it. 
<0> Wow! When you say anaerobic,what do you scientifically mean?
<0> All of it sounds the same and it's awful
<0> what books die he write?
<0> I hate video games, they are such a waste of time. I have never played them. 
<0> It went really well! thanks for asking! I am very much optimistic about the results!
<0> good . do you have any pets ?
<0> what do you do for a living ?
<0> A cheese steak is good though! All that melted cheese over steak! I guess it's kind of useless for a vegetarian though.. 
<0> I feel you, it's quite an advanced concept to think about.
<1> I like puzzles. It's a calming activity. I don't know why I never get anxious in any situation.
<0> I've heard my dad talking. I am not very interested in the team. 
<0> Ah yes me too and I love black tea as well! I am sipping on a local blend from the mountains and it is so smooth
<0> You have a point there. Maybe I should be happy with my old clunker after all lol
<0> yes, my songs. bathroom produce various kinds of standing waves, reverberation and echoes, giving the voice "fullness and depth.
<0> Not yet,  but that is a good idea. I just really need to meet some new people I think.
<0> Oh I'm not nervous at all!
<0> i did ! thank you so much
<1> nice , i am still looking for a job
<0> Oh how nice! My mom works in a grocery store as well.
<0> i do not know how you feel.. i am the youngest
<0> yes, much more than I used to
<0> They always take advantage of me. I can't trust a single one of them. 
<0> It compels me to be a better person and try to be kinder to everyone for sure
<1> I do not like camping and Hiking but i love music
<1> I can imagine, you cannot drive without auto insurance here.
<0> probably all my friends ,  they are big fans too
<0> Too bad I don't like country music
<0> I still had to pay for it and wait but yes they did
<1> Oh I love swimming. I was going to be better than Michael Phelps.
<1> Yeah really i love all of his songs specifically Purple Rain, i only really hate Starfish and Coffee
<1> I am a work-at-home customer service rep. nothing fancy. what do you do
<1> I like to do anything, but I do not enjoy kayaking. 
<0> That is great to hear, I know running can be hard on the knees and swimming will just make your body feel better.  Also, you can swim anywhere there is water and its great to know how to do just in case.
<0> we named our dog bowie because she has two different color eyes, like david bowie
<0> what would you say your favorite band is ?
<1> I love One Direction. They aren't that old.
<0> No, my dog hasn't pooped in the house for quite a while.
<1> the girls and i will have a challenge buying a house warming gift !

<1> I haven't ever sold anything on Facebook. 
<0> Yes it is wonderful. It is like complete peace and harmony. There is nothing better!

<1> I will try one day when i get chance to do for sure
<0> i am from texas , my dad is from turkey and my mom is from alabama

<1> getting the refund is the most important thing!
<0> They do,  they can be way too forward.

<0> base ball in my favorite one and basket ball too.

<1> whether is good
<1> Well I wouldn't know. I hate dogs and can't imagine owning any.
<0> I don't know any teachers so I couldn't advise you one way or the other. 
<0> I'm deathly afraid of heights! I'm so glad I was able to overcome my fear because it was a great experience!
<0> I am probably one of them, because of the sheer joy it gives me to show off my stamp collection!
<1> Hawaii seems far to travel I haven't traveled that far before.
<1> No, I stay here in mainland USA, I do love to visit a tropical island in the future though.
<0> he is still missing after 4 days

<0> I have never lived in San Francisco, but I wish to some day.
<1> My niece loves baking cookies as well! Where's your mom from?
<0> Me either. I tried it a few times and wasn't digging it. I'm more of a salty guy.
<1> Stress has nothing to do with this
<0> Pasta is one of my favorite foods!!
<1> I didnt know that is could infect your mouth has anyone ever gotten super sick from that?
<1> I’d rather not drink
<1> That is a lot wow,  she must really love watching tv atleast it gives her something to do tho! 
<0> I was hungry,  I feel so ashamed of doing that.
<0> Yeah,  but we did move and it ended up the best decision ever! We had so much fun and really loved living there. At least beaches are always free!
<0> Yeah for sure, i cannot really remember what happened the last time we played the bulls but i know it ended bad.
<0> oh yes its very healthy . i  lke most all food .
<0> Fettuccine Alfredo is a favorite of mine too. I love to add grilled chicken, mushroom and spinach to it.
<1> that sound horrible don't think it would be much fun 
<0> That doesn't sound so bad, I would honestly be grateful for any job at this point, I've been unemployed for ages.
<0> I hear Donald Trump used to sell steaks called Trump Steaks. They weren't very good and they were overpriced
<0> Where do you go hiking?
<1> oh great, would put that down for a visit as well
<1> It's probably for the best, you should consider yourself lucky.
<1> I have plenty of energy. 
<0> Truely interesting when you think about all of the clothing that people use to wear, especially during the colonial times.
<0> I was just starting to feel bad and did not expect that to happen. I t just happened and I did not want to look at anyone or make eye contact. I wanted to crawl under the counter and hide.
<1> What is a stomach bug?
<0> I'm not sure, I only made it to episode 3 before I was kicked off the show.
<1> i see your point as well . luckily she was still there .
<1> it is, i never do it, i have a fear of horses
<0> I don't think that's such a good idea because the professor would think I'm a whistleblower.
<0> Me either, I would love to have a child soon.
<0> I thought you had already been.
<1> Sadly no. I'm not much of an artist and don't really have anything to show. I prefer playing games in my free time
<1> I am so scared of sharks, i can not stand them
<1> Why did they need to give you a gift? Were they apologising for something?
<1> Whatever you do, don't sue them. You will lose.
<0> Languages, cause I hate to make money for fun.
<1> I don't listen to Johnny Cash, I think he's a bad musician.

<0> Yea well I bought a dog from the dog pound and they over charged me by $50 and I was really upside by it.
<1> Most likely he will miss you. It might be a terrible experience for him.
<1> Well,  can only wish you luck!  You need to be bold 
<0> SOUNDS INTERESTING, I HEAR THERE WAS A SHOW ABOUT IT AND THE THEME SONG WAS AWESOME
<1> Wow. That is unusual. I would never do that because I do not like vanilla flavored food.

<0> I didn't say that i eat eggs.
<0> I love canadian women, I find them incredibly attractive
<1> Okay, Don't worry about that last year. Definitely you will got a money for coming xmas.
<1> Driving IS frustrating.  I walk a lot, allows for my mind to think.  It's important for art, planning, being creative.
<1> That would be really sad.
<0> I was very annoyed because I had prepared everything!
<1> I wouldn't be too mad. I don't like the color light purple, anyway.
<0> I work at a restaurant, it seems like everybody loves steak. 
<1> What kind of bad dreams?
<0> The plants are amazing
<1> Oh yes I love cheese. Manchego is my most favorite. Do you play video games?
<1> At least I still have one grandparent!
<0> I only want to listen to their songs on my phone. Seeing them live would be way too loud for me. 
<0> I doubt it. He's never really had a dayjob.
<0> Well it sure tastes good but I wouldn't make a habit out of eating them. I also like to get soft pretzels with cheese
<0> Mine are both solid white with brown spots :)
<0> Steak is normally grilled, but they can be pan-fried, or broiled
<0> yeah it really does sound good on my electric violin
<0> Yeah, I can't wait to get on a cruise again!  Exploring a new country every day!
<1> My mother was a vegetarian although she oddly enough could not refuse bacon of all things! lol
<1> I hope it all went well for you.
<0> No I'm still angry at her
<0> It sure had a surprise ending that's for sure
<1> That's why my dream place to live would be northern Alaska, or even Siberia!
<1> Ah I'm sorry to hear that. I'm lucky enough to be surrounded by family.
<0> No kidding, I had no idea they were that large. I think they look really cute with the teeth sticking out of their mouths.
<0> My son doesn't want Nikes, he's always been into Adidas.

<0> Yes, that is a good form of religious practice i should do

<0> She is an American actress, director, and producer.

<0> that's a lot . are you on your 6th ?
<0> Please give me advice. I am broke and poor. I am almost homeless!

<0> It's not as populous as Chicago though.
<1> exactly. i have to wear high heel shoes most of the time
<1> the whole experience annoys me . do you watch tv ?
<1> that is bad but you need to put the money back and not talk to anyone.
<1> No.  This is too boring of a topic and I am quite disinterested.
<0> I am making myself hungry too! Midnight rampage to the fridge! Biggest walk of shame! 
<1> Another one is a religious vegan. They eat any food including meats

<0> do you like to take walks ?
<0> thanks . i love going to see too
<0> I have never been to a theatre before what is it like?
<0> No, I don't think so.  Specializing in the care of ill or premature infants that may or may not survive would be too much for her I think.
<0> A steakhouse, I really want some ribs.
<0> Ew! Bugs? I hate bugs.
<0> That is always hard. You really feel like there is nothing you can do to help.
<0> Predator v Prey, survival
<1> I would go surf in the ocean but I am scared of fish.
<1> I saw my 4 sisters a few days ago and one of them studies mental illness.
<0> I never saw it as a kid. I watch cowboy bebop as an dult. Speed racer was actully adapted into anime by Tatsunoo productions appearantly. What age did you watch it?
<0> And you can never go wrong with a good old Alfred Hitchcock movie. He used different techniques to film and would sometimes allow the viewers in on a pending threat and draw it out for dramatic effect. Priceless
<0> There are five members and they were inducted in 2012 to the Rock & Roll hall of fame
<1> I have no pet currently, but I do love animals.

<0> a 2018 subaru WRX
<0> last night i was in a party and i could return home due to lack of taxi and it wasnt safe 
<0> I can't wait for my grandmother to come over for the holidays. 
<0> I'm sure there have been; in Beauty and the Beast, the theme song was actually a Broadway inspired ballad recorded before the film!
<1> That's a great paying job, I bet it keeps you active. I do micro jobs online as a source of income.
<0> i love cats and dogs
<1> It's not happened to me yet luckily but I'm sure it will one day!
<0> I am happy for you
<0> Not really, to gentle for that.
<1> That's good to know. Do you hook the tube up to like an oxygen tank and wear it?
<0> Yes,  I can't stand them!
<0> I haven't been taking part in any hobbies lately, I've been very depressed.
<1> Maybe be you can drive me to see my mom tomorrow at the amusement park.
<1> is there a chance for meatballs .
<0> Really, anything that can be stacked on white or brown rice.  Fish, fish eggs, Avocado, crab, lobster...mostly seafood of course.
<1> I left the home. I am currently at the hotel. She want me to come back
<0> Driving on the left is right
<0> I play Super Mario Brothers and Metroid. I even remembered most of the levels. It was really cool.

<1> Oh wow really? Didnt know it was trade marked
<0> I love cooking and baking! I find joy in creating my own dishes!
<1> You're welcome. It's good you're talking to me instead of getting a therapist. Therapists are a waste of time and money.
<0> Is exercise important too?
<1> That's good.
<1> You're welcome. You may not do well, but remember that there are other jobs out there. 
<0> But there's nothing that really scares me.
<1> That's true. It was hard after I was first diagnosed, but it's easier now. Everything gets easier with time, even missing your family.
<0> Absolutely, fantastic! Those toppings go great on hamburgs as well. In-fact I think those are the standards you'd expect from fast-food restaurants, diners, and specialty and high-end restaurants 
<1> Yeah I got to see a lot of things when I drove my truck too.
<1> I don’t have a car. 
<1> I have not lived there but visited recently. I would like to learn self defense when I get there.  There was some pretty tough crowds :)
<0> That is good to know! But like one time on my way to lunch someone pushed me face first into the wall. I just went to the bathroom and cried the rest of the day.
<1> i agree . i like staying home to take care of them .
<1> Interesting, what did Thackeray wrote ?
<1> That's cool! I don't like playing that much as other people do.
<1> no , i'm probably gonna go ride my horse tomorrow though .
<1> i am having fun down here
<0> I think you'd have to purchase a special package, like MLB at Bat or the NFL online package. But with most Internet content being significantly cheaper than cable, you'd probably still save money!
<1> Maybe you'll have fun and something unique will happen. It feels good when your day is spontaneous and unexpected things happen.
<1> not really unless i find a book that grabs my attention on the first page, and only book has done that for me
<1> I really detest yellow and I wish sunflowers were a different color.

<1> Well, I don't take it that much. Only once in a month or thereabout.
<1> I use to train MMA for fun to stay in shape but quit. I didn't want to get hurt.
<1> he is safe in canada, there is no snakes there
<1> Drinking isn't any bad though. Just let him have his freedom and fun. You'll trust him more.
<0> Agreed, but I don't really like the taste of them. 
<1> You really do not enjoy posting on instagram.
<0> She stayed with me for an entire week,  taking vacation time from her office.  I am one lucky girl.

<0> hope to visit myself someday
<0> what do you like to do ?
<1> I definitely need to learn how to take care of cars.
<1> It feels awkward. I wasn't even excited when I received a note about the selection for starting.
<0> I need to do something creative. My job is so boring. I feel like I've been doing it forever.
<0> May be that's because its only the mother that takes care of his kids with animals as opposed to human 
<0> I wouldn't know, as I have absolutely no idea what is entailed in homeschooling. I've never looked into it as I am long finished with school, have no children, and no interest in homeschooling.
<1> Oh! That's it! Thank you for reminding me of the name. That is the restaurant I am going to try. I will let you know if they sign or not.

<1> I hope you're not having a good day, then.

<1> new jersey , temporarily in my parents basement while my apartment is being renovated .
<0> You should try a little, but i do not like my family very much, so playing together sucks.
<1> No Big Mac's, No Queens of the Stone Age, what do you do in Texas besides horses?
<1> But it couldn't have gotten worse than that. Normally people are very good drivers.
<0> Nah. I can't bake at all, I'd be terrible at it. I usually just go to this local bakery down the street. It's so much easier that way.
<0> they are artistic and like to show diversity .
<0> I was,  thankfully! I couldn't be mad at her for too long either. She is just a young pup after all.
<1> ac dc is awesome ! they have got so many great hits ! i have one of their band shirts from the 80s.
<0> Yeah, 1940 for the original recipe is nothing compared to Coke back in like 1880.
<0> i love france. such a beautiful country. I have family that live there
<0> cello ! mom taught me . what do you like doing on weekends ?

<0> I can't stand Pink, her singing is horrible.
<0> I really can't wait for Fall. Love the autumn trees.
<0> And the surreal humour and profanity used especially as it was based around four kids appealed to me. What did you like about it?
<1> That's awful. I would move out of a town like that. I imagine it's very memorable as most people remember their lines.
<1> Too bad i am really broke
<1> i have a husky and a chocolate lab. what's your beagle's name and how old is he?
<0> Yes it is, some people may cry or laugh but in my case it was very boring.
<0> i do not have time to shop much any more , i'm in the gym daily .
<1> What do you do for living?
<1> i work 9-5 as a receptionist and then i like to volunteer too
<1> Yes,  that happens everytime!
<0> i have not had a frosty since i went vegan . i miss them , though .
<1> well, I think I intimidate people too much
<1> I wish i had a job
<0> No, the belly was small and it's meat has a bad flavor :)
<1> Awwwn, what is her color?
<0> I was suprised how energetic she was at the end of the day. She just doesnt get tired.
<1> Me too! Photography is something I have wanted to start for years but just can't find the time. 
<0> That's weird. I don't drink soft drinks anyway so it doesn't bother me
<1> Maybe so, but I hate it. I prefer Pepsi.
<1> lol i bet it is
<0> I did. They would not come to the door.
<1> Yeah the winter is awesome. The other three seasons are not outdoor friendly
<1> its all good. you are able to write very well. im jealous
<0> Me too. Tacos aren't that good.
<0> A lot of these events like to be set during the time of Queen Elizabeth I of England. People wear all the old clothes and really get into character.
<1> I will send you an invitation.  All expenses paid. I hope so though.
<1> I agree, that's why I went shopping physically today. I never do shopping online
<1> Whatever sells the most really which are currently portriats, i sold 10 last week alone!
<0> Pizza is my go to dish out all those Italian dishes. I like Pizza most.
<0> I read a lot of books and try to find other Filipinos to hang out with which is pretty hard
<1> i've been thinking about training dogs , weird past time huh ?
<0> Same here, I have really sensitive teeth. Sweet things hurt too
<0> That's so cool. Maybe I should teach myself how to inline skate, after all, it's never too late to try!
<0> I'll probably start once my kids are in school.
<1> I'm sure they care
<1> Yeah it ok here. I mean how come your parents abandoned you what happened? Did anyone tell you?
<0> Oh nice those are all very nice locations to visit in New York.  What was your favorite place ?

<0> I ended up dropping my lunch tray in front of a girl I was attracted to!
<1> Not really, on top of being 25 and living with my parents, I don't have a driver's license.
<0> It seems that way, but I live with my mom and dad and it gets to be a bit much.
<1> Am glad it sounds so fun for you,enjoy yourself when you get there
<1> Been to Spain last week for a vacation. Loved it
<1> I don't want you to talk to me.
<0> They will, but I absolutely hate eggplant.
<0> Thanks. Is there anything else I should know about treating my cold?
<1> You can have it. I hate sandwiches.
<0> Likewise! I love driving. I would never travel any other way!.
<1> I'm sorry that you have to deal with OCD. What else should I know about the disorder?
<0> I have to get some allergy shots.  I hate getting shots.  They are no fun at all.  I get so nervous just thinking about it
<1> I don't know. It doesn't seem like that good of a place.
<0> Honestly, I like pineapple on pizza.  I don't know why people think it's okay to put all sorts of toppings on a pizza, but not pineapple.  
<1> yeah and i am short so i can be more sneaky .
<1> I'd love to work in an office - but right now I work at a restaurant.
<1> I'm sorry. I hope you can work things out without too much drama.
<1> Why? He didn't do anything wrong.
<0> Yep and as immigrants my parents are very suspicious.
<0> Probably look into getting it fixed.
<1> I'm all over the place. I used to be a line cook so I learned to make a lot of things. Japanese, German and Southern foods are my favs though.
<1> Ohhh!!! I like butter chicken too, Chicken is my all time favorite food to eat.
<0> I speak only English and I wish I knew other languages
<0> I am well played cricket match in ground.
<1> Oh my mistake i was thinking about a different book
<0> All the terrible news on TV is giving me the cold feet and might be best to just stay home.
<1> I like to have a set of goals for the week to accomplish.
<1> For sure, I can teach you how to swim since you are not vegan.
<0> Oh, I'm not a janitor.
<0> I actually just had a big job interview,  and I am not sure how the results are gonna go.
<0> I plan to learn to play dodge ball soon
<1> Oh, it's a shame he doesn't have any interesting things to say never
<0> mechanical engineer, so have you got a job yet just from college
<0> I am not quite sure. And I wonder where auto racing originated from?
<0> I'll try. It's tough to keep a positive attitude because my boss has been quite mean to me recently.
<0> I love cricket but never played it.
<1> It might be good to talk to her more, get her to open up and discuss her feelings 
<0> A team meeting and I am presenting
<0> I am thinking about doing something,  maybe that too
<0> Lucky you to be so close! Yeah,  I had so much fun,  especially since I could spend a lot of time with my partner and a lot of time swimming! 
<0> Tiger Woods is actually not the greatest at golf. He played for many years before turning pro.
<1> Yep I love to travel so I went to cali to see them
<1> Well. if you like KFC, you won't find a store in Kentucky.They hate chicken there.
<0> one day you will be rich enough to come to argentina and have empanadas
<0> but i feel you just see the bad
<0> It's really not easy 
<0> Cedar Point! got the pass at a discount.
<0> Oh, I've seen some families go through some tough decisions in that regard -- whether it's with welcoming in a new animal or new human (aka baby!)
<0> That's a shame but understandable. They put out a lot of great music over the years.
<0> Maybe I should open up a bike repair shop and live the dream! 
<1> That's  amazing! I am terrible at those things! 
<1> a very good point ! what else do you like to do in your spare time ?
<0> i live in a small town my self and sometimes i will come into name brand stuff. 
<1> Advanced Calculus, I only have a 97 in the class.
<0> though i am a dancer,i don't like dancing 
<0> I am so pumped up. I would love to do that. Great idea.
<0> my car is not in the best of shape and if i take it to the repair shop I wont meet up,  so what I did is I left home very early
<0> it can be very tiring though
<0> Yeah, I've run in many marathons, so I'm used to the training.
<1> a lot of kids love burgers but red meat makes me sick , hate it .
<0> I hate guitars, I have no interest in playing one.
<0> my cousin's father in law won an oscar for art director
<0> The piano wasn't invented until 1700 in Italy and it was invented to have the strings struck by hammers.   I always thought the piano had been around longer than that!
<0> wow super, can you please tell me one law?
<0> Yes we did. Just another trophy to add to my collection.
<0> Hm.. Okay, I'll have to watch out for that. Are there any more details about the autism spectrum itself? If not, anything on what's helpful for those who have it?
<0> Huh, not really. They are just awful. I want to look for other breeds- do you have any suggestions?
<1> I'm pretty certain you won't get in.
<0> oh gosh ! that's scary ! what else do you like ?
<1> No. I wouldn't have time as I already have two boys and a girl of my own.
<0> I loved it! I was so sad when it ended.
<0> what is one of your favorite scenes?
<0> Thats stupid. Almost as stupid as writing a novel.
<0> No, I'm going to Beijing, in China.
<1> You are not lucky at all.
<1> I don't think i would ever be comfortable using cannabis. even if it's legal. but i'm really glad it worked for you
<0> only 19 years old . i still have imaginary friends . ll
<1> Don't worry about it. I'm sure you'll be safe enough.
<0> White chocolate is also cool. It a kind of laxative to the brain
<0> Oh yes I want to be a hyvrid of vincent price and tim curry. Thoughts?
<0> I do not sew anything because I hate tailoring, high fashion and dressmaking.
<1> jokes are always wonderful i think
<1> No, but it will let you know what an idiot Donald Trump is!
<1> Oh me too, since birth I have been a heavy church goer. 
<1> Man, I hate watching old movies
<1> Her first album came out in 2006.
<1> I hate running, but it's great exercise.

<0> Yes! I understood. By the way what is your favourite colour?
<0> Until Mexico's independence, winemaking was only allowed to be hobby there too
<1> i like your dog , he sounds cool
<0> Only that if they are all electronic, the scoring and positioning is the same.
<1> It's no big deal. This happens all the time.
<0> They really are. I would like to own one someday but sadly I don't at the moment.
<0> not me . i love to be with people ! do you have hobbies ?
<1> Really? I love my office job. 
<0> I have a lot of spare time because I have no hobbies.
<0> I bet her temple of worship was a lot of fun.
<1> It sounds like a terrible time to me. 
<1> I've never seen one either but I hear they are very beautiful.
<1> No, and I don't really think it is that important
<1> myself too.it sounds very cute
<0> I have lost a few pounds; however, the real reason why I started it was because it helps with epilepsy, and my doctor recommended me to try it. It has surprisingly has helped. 
<1> I never really want to go there. It is kind of expensive there so no for me.
<0> That is crazy, do you know why they wouldn't just shoot it where the setting is?
<1> I am at work and having an awful day
<1> I love playing games. We play together as a family sometimes. However, it is nice being single and having that free time. 
<0> Yes, of course!
<1> I don't think she's going to learn anything from this. 
<0> I like sci-fi too.
<1> Me too,it is nerve wrecking.
<1> I think the innocence of it all - life gets a lot more boring when you have to be responsible and not so oblivious haha
<0> Yeah, and like college, mechanics still typically need to be certified, which is like a degree in a way
<1> she recently moved back to the bay area . we lived there when we were younger .
<0> Yes, but it keeps me away from my pets and I miss attending to them properly.
<0> They've already been a huge help. Once me and my wife get back from our honeymoon we look forward to seeing them all.
<0> Despite being so important then, it only became in English word in 975 AD.
<1> I am good at approaching people.
<0> i have a few . they're older now .
<1> I love my Nintendo 64 the most. SNES was kind of boring and the graphics were lackluster.
<0> do you have any children ?
<0> Do you ever want to have a different career?
<0> I'm not sure...he's been acting up the past few years. I wish I knew why. I've never been so disappointed in him.
<0> I don't think so. It's just the flavor 
<0> I enjoyed seeing the Alamo. Texans have real pride for their state! 
<0> sure about what
<1> Yeah, if only her last album had done well, she would really be a star.
<0> I don't know how to make it and usually buy them in the bakery.
<1> that sounds a lot like me.  I always try to observe and then choose wisely.
<0> he left the gate open and my dog ran away
<0> That's the only time I have ever cheated on anything.
<1> I don't like the idea of adopting a dog,it really never excites me.
<0> Pretty hungry,  but the cake looks so good so I want even more. Strawberry shortcake style.
<0> Oh yea i hear tatoos hurt bad. 
<0> Oh yeah, I think I saw the UN building in a movie. What about the statue of liberty, why was it built?
<0> did that store sell yarn ? i need a lot of that to sew my own clothes .
<0> I have a big meeting with my boss.
<0> what is your ethnicity ? i'm white , and my hair is brown .
<0> touch . maybe some veggies can help . i love me some veggies
<1> Soccer is a fun sport to play. It would be good for you to do something you love also. I too can no longer run fast
<1> Same here.
<0> Prince really wasn't all that great of a musician. 
<0> I can understand that. It's tough to drive when gas prices are higher. 
<0> I always wondered if they raced more than just cars like maybe motorcycles so that really clears that up.
<0> There is a lot of one-on-one counseling, I know because I've been an alcoholic since I was 13. 
<0> I've never been to Las Vegas, I do all of my magic shows on the east coast. 
<1> I would love to visit Nashville. Is it as lovely as I hear?
<0> Bummer, cars can be harder to drive or less fun if you did not pick the car.
<1> Yeah,  just make sure that you aren't in too much of a rush like that.
<0> It can be but i have my cats to keep me company
<0> That's a while. Do you run everyday?
<1> That's cool! I was thinking of upgrading from the Wii U to the switch
<0> grunge . i am actually in a band with my sister .
<0> Our state volleyball match,  This was going to be a huge moment in my life.
<1> do you have all your teeth ?
<1> I dont have a favorite museum. I dont like museums to be honest. I dont have a lot of friends and there's nothing to do here so I just visit them.
<0> You're right! I work in an office and I need peace and quiet when I get home. 
<0> I type with one finger. I can't type very fast.
<0> Ok! Let's do it!
<0> That's interesting! Do you eat them like an apple? 
<1> Oh man..I just had someone go through that. It is horrifying. Yes a long battle can be good or bad. I am sorry.
<1> 3 years lots of corruption 
<0> Role playing games are not cool!
<0> I didn't want to only have one stinky shoe so I stepped in with the other foot. Then I jumped a few times. The smell was so nauseating.
<1> not steak , i'm a vegan . i write rather than cook .
<0> yes some times i don't really have a good social life though
<1> yes i can also make french , italian and chinese
<0> It was characterized by the individual changes involves in our body and mind
<0> They buy most of their items from expensive stores to make sure the hungry get quality food.
<1> Me too - there was an episode that was on HBO. It was interesting.
<0> you ready for football to start this weekend ? i'm a huge sports fan . been waiting .
<0> I was hungover and sick
<0> I had a meeting that day so everyone at the meeting noticed.
<0> He was in his mid 60s
<1> It's mostly in Wyoming and a little bit in Montana. 
<0> yes thats true, and the vet bills are very costly too
<1> That's awesome, being able to relate to someone like him is cool! Not everyone can say they're the same age as him.
<0> I am also still in high school.
<0> being a mom is undervalued in my opinion
<0> I could say major surgery. It is a surger for an ulcer.
<1> no, I'm agnostic and I never pray.
<0> Which is your hobbies?
<0> yes i'm, i hate pet its so nausea.
<1> Seafood is the best!
<1> nice . my inspiration is in the world
<0> I like to eat out a lot and don’t have a big mess anyway. Cleaning is not fun.
<0> I could never do yoga, it sounds too hard. 
<0> It's very fulfilling. I don't think I would want to do much else. "Equine-assisted psychotherapy" already sounds cool enough as it is, lol.
<0> I am a terrible builder. I want to try and build a dog house this weekend.
<0> Lol! I remember this one boy dressed up like Elvis and sang Hound Dog, and he won that year. It was adorable but I was still upset I didn't win. Haha!
<0> I hate museums, they are very boring, especially science ones. 
<1> I am ok. I like to drink tea before bed it help to relaxe. it getting colder here these last days
<0> I find candy too sweet and prefer salty snacks.
<1> no i usually fall asleep as i dont drink coffee
<0>  sweetness, sourness, saltiness, bitterness, meaty and savoriness. Meaty being my favorite.
<0> oh wow thats cool.
<1> Whatever you do, don't let them think you are interested in them by flirting too much.
<1> I love Apple, It's very good.
<0> yes ! just me and george haha ! are you married ?
<0> tofu is really bad with soup.
<1> Yeah morning is my favorite time too
<0> Steak is my favorite too. The bloomin onion is also a great appetizer.
<0> I don't know, maybe they just do not have the time or something. We all do have flaws after all. Being wealthy must be so hard to manage.
<0> Both of which can have a completely different experience. I'm looking forward to going to my next one.
<1> Nice do you mind sharing what it was...my mom had a cyst in her ovaries but it ended up being benign
<0> awesome been married 5 years and i work for a candy shop .
<0> Halo is such a boring game, I prefer Mario Kart
<1> Nah, I eat it all the time and I am a veteran.
<0> I just taught a class on teriyaki preparation at the college i teach at.
<1> Well it makes sense there's tension between you. If I were her, I'd be furious!
<1> That was kind of herr
<0> I dropped out of school so I could work full time. What would you go for?
<1> In Minnesota, I'm sure it wouldn't compare to what you can see in Alaska though. How long will you go for?
<1> Would love too but I'm actually pretty allergic to cats. :/ Have you ever owned a cat?
<0> Yes it had many seasons. The first season began in September of 2008. I loved the show.
<1> Friends are always gives you troubles and one can better off from them. 
<0> nah she did not ,  none of them did since they are in first grade ,  but now the boy leaves her alone
<0> I kept telling myself that I was going to do it "later",  but "later" never came. I can't blame her for being mad.
<1> I'm too frail to care for anything else.
<1> I don't really think you can really trust a dog though you know?  Like they are always waiting for your back to be turned- to get into something, or bite you.  You can always trust a scavenger to be disloyal.
<0> But i hate all kinds of music.
<0> Yes.  I tried, but found Spanish much easier.  Imagine learning Chinese or Japanese.  They seem very hard.
<1> that is a always normal day and nothing special in that
<1> Well that was not very nice of her.
<0> It is for a manager position. I just wish they would call soon. Its hard waiting around.
<1> Cool, I usually paint my dog.
<0> I am a school teacher
<1> I don't know I'm unemployed.
<0> i'm a baker by trade . and i sell or donate everything i catch on a hunt
<0> Gardens originated in prehistoric times along river banks and the foothills of jungle monsoon regions.
<1> i'm a little bit to paranoid for a job .
<1> how do you have time for so many cats ?
<0> They were scary, I really hated the fun house.
<0> well that's good ! i had a good friend of mine pass away from a heart condition
<0> Maybe that is true. Im an not sure.
<1> Yes, the day time is my favorite, also.
<0> I have a green Ford.
<0> I don't like going to museums. I honestly feel like the art is too try-hard. I think I'm great at drawing and can do better than them.
<1> It's nice that you've been able to see the positive that comes from such a devastating experience. I can see how that would bring you all closer together.
<1> but clowns haven't changed at all
<0> I don't think boycotts are that important, we should stick with social media.
<0> It definitley was. I was so proud of myself!
<0> Well I hope it goes well for you, it's important to continue learning all throughout life. 
<0> I have never been to or seen any Miss USA beauty pageants. I don't even know who the current winner is.
<0> thats cool
<0> i do ! even though i'm a grown adult i still like unicorns .
<1> oh yes , pizza is yummy ! i enjoy it but its hard to find organic only pizza .
<0> It is very cold here by the beaches too!
<1> Bummer. Meeting women is never good. 
<1> well i had one that did that and he lived to 17 so there may still be hope
<0> Not really too concerned, she's 21 and can read up about it on her own.
<0> Yep. I did. That $65 charge is no joke.
<1> I guess its different if you live where it gets cold during the winter. But there are places where it is always super warm.
<0> I adore dogs. My favorites are beagles and Labrador retrievers. If i sure see a snake 7 feet around me, I am running as fast as I can.
<1> I don't have any siblings, I'm an only child. 
<0> because i don't like pizza that much.
<1> I like going on walks with my dog, reading, and writing.
<0> Do you? I hate all that rock crap.
<1> It sounds really horrible and annoying
<1> I won't miss out on anything. I want three kids.
<1> No i do not work in the recruiting department i work in the purchasing department
<0> Classic rock? I do not like it at all
<1> that's great, I like this drinking game, did you say vagrant
<1> No, I never had. I think that we actually need less farmers to make our economy less agrarian. 
<1> Do you prefer to watch sports in person or on tv?
<1> They never give the quote and can't do it anyway
<0> yes because I was so ashamed of what I did.
<1> Reliable friends aren't as great to have as people think though.
<1> Not yet but would love to be on one, how about you?
<0> I just swim at the beach mostly
<1> Rhiana is very much alive, I though you knew that. 
<0> I should have bought him some food, I regret it.
<0> Probably fried chicken,  it's very different and much more flavourful than KFC
<0> no i have not been to the movies in awhile .
<0> though i don't like photography because i think it's a waste of time,i kinda find it boring.
<0> Cooking is such a pain, I only do it if I have to.
<1> food is so so good . it is so bad
<0> It's best if you don't ad pesto, you never want to put that in the sauce.
<1> I actually think they mostly know what the importance of school is, you need to have more faith in him. 
<0> Oh? Is the Island Carib known for cannibalism or something? That's creepy!
<1> yeah this is some spicy spicy stuff . burnt my ass
<0> Yes, and they starred in another movie together ten years later.  It was called Revolutionary Road
<0> No, I've never been very interested in CIrque du Soleil.
<1> I mostly like to stay inside
<0> yes , i've one boy and you ? they like movies ?
<0> Probably in a burrito from Taco Bell, they are disgusting.
<0> He is a custom built chicken mage yes. Tell me more of your knowledge of Magic the Gathering.
<0> Well satisfaction is defined in many ways, but I enjoy having good health benefits. 
<1> How sweet! So, what kind of things do you like to do in your spare time?
<1> What is the difference between the two?
<0> awww i am sorry to hear that
<1> I'm too focused on driving so I never will take time to acknowledge other drivers.
<0> It doesn't seem like you work very hard.
<0> that's not good . you should ride your bike , it really improves the mood .
<1> I can not think of what I did to make her go.  But she left.
<0> Oh that's great! Did you know armadillos eat fire ants?
<0> That must've been when I was in first grade. A long time ago,  but the sunshine and a warm breeze always makes me remember.
<0> It was history,  my favorite
<1> no to europe . can i fly with you ? i can grow potatoes .
<1> Oh great.  I grew up in Michigan.  I'm from Detroit.
<0> Haha, yes, you COULD try that! Like the native peoples of the Pacific!
<0> i get it . i also like to dress people up .
<0> Only a few times, yeah. It's too.scary for.my tastes. Don't you get scared?
<0> I just really wanted some ice cream! Now I know their hours,  though.
<1> i'm sure it didn't occur
<1> Honestly, I just don't know how I do misplace all my old videos as I'm careless when it comes to keeping things like that
<1> I guess.   But I can never seem to drag myself into the gym to do any of them.  It's been months since I saw the inside of a gym. 
<1> Rock music is awful. I would rather listen to country music.
<1> I like my calm country store maintenance job
<0> I'm not worried about what people think!
<0> I don't add any meat to my pizza, but I love to add cheese.
<1> Wow that's really gross! Maybe next time you should have something more simple, like a grilled cheese sandwich. Those are delicious!
<1> I would feel completely different.
<1> You should have given it to  your baby to plau with.
<0> That child was so rude and interrupting everyone at the party.
<1> My mom and older brother. My dad left me when I was 2.
<0> I am ashamed of how much money I make,  I barely make a livable income
<0> Oh really? I've only seen a few episodes here and there, I get bored by science fiction
<0> My father teachs also, at least in the since of very small young children.
<1> It certainly is very special. Are you a vegetarian or do you like meat?
<1> I don't think so, I do not like it
<0> The company I interviewed for has very low paying salaries and the interviewer seemed mean.
<0> Of course .We love each other
<0> oh wow ! what are your kids favorite music genre ?
<0> That's true. I'll get him something more personal for Christmas
<1> do you have an ax , i have a huge one
<0> She was furious. I've never seen her look so stricken. Be turned the car around in perfect silence. We knew we were in for it.
<0> I like the Stars!'
<0> do you like italian food ? i've to watch what i eat .
<0> Yes,  that's what I was thinking. I almost thew up.
<1> O no I hope you tried to stop him
<0> took the kids out to peter piper pizza!
<0> yes sesame seeds are my favourite topping
<0> I haven't thought about the Beach Boys in a long time! My dad was a big fan. I grew up listening to them.
<0> Its so much fun,  really pretty down there too. Oh in a few hours! 
<0> It isn't. I hate it and never make it. 
<1> You are so lucky. I am with my family now. I missed them so much. 
<1> I actually think its kind of lame, but you do you.
<0> I'm a disc jockey at a local radio station. 
<0> Yes. I am still in the marine and don't have plans of retiring soon.
<0> I couldn't with work and all.
<0> It was not popular in Greece.
<1> Yes sure, I'm a yoga instructor and there are many other yoga poses
<0> That's good. Tragedy can do that. I never had any siblings so I'll never feel that pain of loss. 
<1> yes, u can say that aagin
<1> I'd rather just pray indoors than go outside.
<0> no I was scared out of my witts!
<0> but i like blue color very much
<0> gonna get chocolate wasted!
<0> Sorry ,  I mean my salary. But I didn't get it this time.
<0> probably ! there are clients for everything !
<1> Being hot is nice, but working out and shedding pounds like a drag. 
<0> YEah, that test was so easy
<0> Yeah,  but that's the trouble. I've talked too much about it.
<1> Same here, I am so glad I do not own a dog. 
<1> I understand.  I rarely have time off.
<1> You shouldn't seek revenge.
<0> texas . i love nevada too .
<0> Colony on USA. It was just getting good this season. I hate it when they do that!
<0> For my first it was because I didn't know what to expect,  but for my second is was more exciting than anything.
<0> I'm so proud of you. I'll plan to come see you at the booked gig. Make sure to send me the info.
<1> wow 6th place in what
<1> That is a great one too!  In fact, according to Publishers Weekly, Dr Seuss has 16 of the top 100 best selling children's books of all time!
<1> You know, I don't recall either.  I do know he was a high school dropout in 9th grade, and he then became a carpenter, and lost part a finger!!
<0> chool Supplies have less competition over the years with many companies out of business or being absorbed, only 1-3 brands on average are in a store
<0>  My grandson hate Kings of Leon though
<1> I hate running! I get bored with my thoughts
<1> I hope to get some alone time soon
<1> Me too, I have never been before but I would love to go.
<0> Yeah they talk like they know it all but they are terrible at their jobs. 
<1> Well I usually have enough time after work to spend with my family and I really enjoy that.
<0> i like christian electronic dance music , you ?
<1> Join the club! I've been vegan for almost 8 years now. 
<1> That's great. I also enjoy the privacy and comfort of living alone. That's the best thing!
<1> I can keep a secret.
<0> I know most people do.  I guess I'm rather a hermit who prefers not getting calls and texts. :)
<1> same  for me i'm mostly outdoors playing football
<1> Why? Was it not your birthday?
<0> I totally get that - I love animals. The ancient Greeks and Indians sound as if they were good people.
<1> i have a lot of free time so i might take up cooking some time, who knows!
<1> what sport do you play ?
<0> No they didn't change names they have always been Radiohead. 
<0> best ! i'm actually going to be cooking them up , want to come on over ?
<1> do you have any favorite bands ? i like to listen to kings of leon
<0> I see, those are the two big shot cities so that makes sense. 
<0> I do have more just not large possessions like my truck. I listen to Adam Levine on the sound system I bought for my room when I moved back in with my folks.
<0> I love stamp collecting and have done so since childhood.
<1> Yeah, it is somewhere in South Dakota that they are headquartered.
<0> No,  I am not nervous at all. I know it will go great.
<1> But It's not a comfort food.
<0> agreed. have you ever seen a shark?
<1> Why are you still telling me about the coast, I want to hear about Africa.
<0> We mostly watched TV but we also made cinnamon rolls. I want to try this putting strawberries in the oven thing next time.
<1> i bet they are , are they in school yet , kids love school
<0> Is that what you did?
<1> there is something always special about an old car
<0> I like soccer and long tennis and cooking at home.
<1> That is a good point, I don't like how the iPhone keeps using the same hardware.
<0> I think I will name the boys Tyler and Michael. 
<0> Doesn't he play for the Golden State Warriors? If it's the guy I'm thinking off, he's pretty nifty on the court!
<1> I always order well done. The blood in medium rare makes me queasy.
<0> ok
<1> I hate surfing, it irritate me a lot.
<1> That's cool. I wish I knew how to play a classical musical instrument!
<1> Jesus! I hate opening my mail already because it's bills,  I can't imagine trying to do something that ambitious which in of itself is a lot of work to get a business started and you have to learn so many different things,  and then on top of it being sent stuff like that. Agghh! I hope it ends well for you,  though.
<0> Ground beef is an pretty amazing invention.  The recipe has been used in everything from spaghetti to cheeseburgers.  Do you eat ground beef often?
<1> Lol yes. The southeast is a nice place to live. Although mostly I just really love our food.
<0> Yes when I came home the next day my mom had found him and boy was I happy.
<0> I would love to restore mine one day, I do not think it would cost a lot.
<0> I wish i knew how that feels but i have no business of mine.
<0> some . i prefer to play drums in my spare time .
<0> I have to disagree, I think Mcdonald's is disgusting and the thought of it makes me sick.
<1> I loved it. I was in the 5th grade and it was for my friends birthday party.
<1> Oh no, I hope your eye is okay. She could have easily blinded you.
<0> there are a lot of left turns
<0> oh, I would never eat blue jello - I'm allergic to the blue dye they put in it.
<1> i do because i normally sleep early every day and i do get 8 to 9 hours of sleep everyday.
<1> Right and you want the meat to stay juicy and tender. 
<0> i have a bachelors degree in psychology .
<1> Yeah it's not a big deal at all. I'd be happy about it. 
<1> Are you gonna try to keep that sort of balance going forward?
<1> I guess that gives you some motives too, so that you can act in a certain way
<1> My favorite comic is Spiderman. 
<1> i eat a lot of vegetables . i just started to grow a garden .
<1> i love it, especially my superviser, he's cute
<1> I love to read. Tell me the names of some of your favorite authors.
<0> 2 million people doesn't seem like very many hikers a year, considering that it is over 2000 miles long. 
<0> That's cool you like to sing but I am not a fan of singing.
<1> They are new. So I wear them while playing football because I don't really care if they break
<0> Yes, it's the same kind of job I had previously, and I hate it.
<1> That's terrible,  I hope they are ok now.
<0> I agree, eye contact is important
<0> Human resources probably deal with this alot and gets tired of having to manage those situation and polices.
<1> Yes , although it feels like summer today fall will definitely be here fast .
<0> Its a well known fact that people sound better in solos than in choirs. 
<1> very true . what color are your eyes ?
<0> I am not sure, but it is most popular in Canada Russia and the United States
<1> that would be a great one. I like tattoos that mean something. I should get a piece of fried chicken tattooed on my arm, that is my favorite food lol!!
<1> Oh, then I guess you are feeling very popular!
<1> I normally spent a lot of time working out, normally 3-4 days a week! Helps keep me in shape
<1> Well, I hope everything turns out fine. Rain is such a nuisance and just all around bad.
<1> I stayed up late last night and had to get up really early, so I didn't sleep well at all last night.
<0> Yes,  I have a special place in my heart for classic music. 
<1> I try to be a honest person at all times.
<0> ok then, I don't know anything about electronic game.
<1> Yeah, I should really look into online grocery delivery. I'm about to head to the store with my two boys but I wish I could just take a nap instead.
<1> gotcha , do any reading ? i do i like agatha christie
<0> I don't watch TV so i don't know.
<1> interesting 
<0> I already have plans, but i have heard they have a HUUUGE halloween party with lots of adult fun
<1> cool maybe you could design me a house
<1> Well good luck with your future projects or your future job.
<0> Where does your family live? 
<1> Did the dream feel like it was really happening? Strange indeed.
<1> i met this girl at the community theater i go to when i am not in school
<1> ham is my favorite . what do you do for work ?
<0> today is a good day.
<0> I've heard of those ones too, especially the Cayenne.
<1> I don't think space is needed. It would be bad.
<0> No, I didn't know about that one! It's difficult to imagine such an ancient civilization doing one of the most popular forms of literature nowadays!
<1> Must find some cool things while doing it.
<1> I dont like playing soccer, i play basketball
<1> Well, make some day I can invite you to my football game. Im sure you will enjoy it.
<1> usually my flights are not more than 3 hours as I fly only domestic desitnations.
<1> I'm sorry to hear that. I can't wait to move out myself.
<0> But 90 percent of the US regions are filled with buildings as Urban.
<1> Being single also makes me busy. Specially the weekends when I go party.
<1> She's 4
<1> You should be a better friend and help her find it.
<1> Just one cat.....well nearly no cats as it happens! Have you got any pets yourself?
<0> I have never heard of them actually, but I guess that makes sense since I am relatively young and country music has been arouind so long
<0> Through the never was agreat movie, Metallica has done a great job as a band
<0> Maybe, they should not have puppies and kittens because of the liability issues though?
<1> I've never even heard of Henry Bergh
<0> Nice! Do you have any pets?
<1> i am afraid to though because i lost my parents in a plane crash .
<0> I need to learn how to swim 
<0> Thanks for all of your support, I hope the same for you in your quest for a job
<0> I actually just moved over the couch a bit while they were in the restroom.
<1> You should probably just let him go. You can't coddle him forver.
<1> Yes, it is such fun. Have you ever baked or made candy?
<1> Thats fun I most play video games during my free time
<0> I make less than 30k a year and it is not enough to pay my bills.
<1> nice but i dont really like pie
<0> I have never trained any other frozen dairy deserts other than ice cream, but I would love to.
<1> i believe people fall in and out of love throughout their lives . not right now .
<1> I have my own place in New York its small but I get by. 
<1> She is really remarkable.  Did you see her on Dancing with the Stars last year?  Amazing!
<0> Nice ! How about the other laws in physics?
<0> That is really good to hear
<0> Thanks. It's hard all of the time but the anniversary always just brings it all back. Makes me feel really down.
<1> i paint picture stories, because i never enjoy writing 
<0> around 6 years ago, he was 10 when he was diagnosed.
<0> No I didn't watch it because I don't really like Queen Latifah. 
<1> It's not that sad.
<1> No, I hate cats and I am allergic to them. 
<0> and lot's of Italian dishes that were only regional,  have proliferated with variations throughout the country.
<0> I recently went to the Philippines and saw so many wild cats everywhere on the streets. Lots of dogs too... Lots of breeds of dogs too
<0> i love to eat tacos with them
<1> Sounds good, would love to play with you guys.
<0> Yeah. Foster care is more individualized I suppose. What do you think about the situation?
<0> Me too, I just watched it last week. 
<1> You should stop playing. You're never going to win.
<1> yes ! I have two cats actually, one for each of my kids!
<1> Yeah,that's too bad.
<0> it's okay. lol. what do you want to do in space?
<0> What are tropical animals?
<0> No I was grossed out by him digging through the trash and eating it.
<0> Not really, I'm not a pizza guy.
<0> we met through a friend and the first time i saw her i knew i was gonna be with her for the rest of my life
<1> no i don't like biking . but if you have fun with it that's great
<0> l have some friends coming over, can't wait to catch up with them
<1> Same here! He cooks pancakes, eggs, sausage and bacon. My daughter loves it too. lol
<0> Not really, I despise her and her family.
<1> Do you have a dog? i never had one, i hate dogs.
<1> Oh, good you can enjoy yourself.
<1> good that the nap helped you to feel better without getting it pulled out.
<1> I watch all kind of movies
<1> That's great. I went to Europe for a while and came back to the more of the same stomping around above my head. It was a dream to get away.
<1> that is wonderful . i am a librarian myself !
<1> I hate it. I can't stand the cold. I much prefer summer and spring.
<0> Well im not excited to go blind since visual impairment may cause people difficulties with normal daily activities
<0> I don't rap, so no.
<0> wow that's not good. did you tell your boss that she lied?
<1> People usually notice when people are drowning, it's not really luck
<0> Yes, my doctor told me that I probably came into close contact with an infected person. I also could have picked it up indirectly through contact with objects. Like shopping carts.
<1> Do you cook by campfire as well?
<1> I'm well mostly,  but ready for Fall to come.
<0> my own abilities,  i am so smart,  i am scared of what i may become 
<0> lol I usually don't carry cash!
<1> Maybe it's a thing of the past?!
<1> i'm a chef , i love to cook
<0> That's neat I'd like to visit  London. 
<0> that does sound good . we are having pasta with scallops tonight .
<0> I'm not sure how many are in the NHL, which is the biggest hockey league. I know that it is also popular in Belarus, Croatia, Russia, and Sweden, so there's probably a lot of teams.
<0> I know that dog food is formulated and intended for consumption by dogs and other canines 
<0> It;s so shady, i am certain it isn't the best for me! the F-150 is in the 10th generation. i will go for a better one
<1> i would never pray to live there 
<0> Pineapple is a fruit for sure, its the only fruit I like on a pizza.
<0> Neat!  Are those two breeds related to each other then?
<1> I hope to visit the campus someday.
<0> That's why I take so much medication all the time.
<1> I don't know what happens in the movie either
<1> a calico cat named majora . she hates it when i sing in the shower .
<0> oh yea those are pretty powerful a friend of mine has one
<0> I'm a smoker and get winded when I run.  It sounds like I should get some basic training as a boxer first.
<1> I can understand you.
<1> I followed her career from the beginning from when she first started in New York. I know all about her.
<0> I have a "Pig Day" tshirt from a festival last year.
<0> Cool. I am not a cardigans person. So I don't wear them.
<0> The movie is irrelevant to American culture, 
<0> Yep, they've been around a good while, and don't look to be going anywhere anytime soon!
<1> Finally, its about time you started working.
<1> That's bare minimum though. I believe you should do more to be a good friend.
<0> sometimes , yes ! i'm just addicted . do you have any addictions ?
<0> They are too huge, I wish I had got a smaller dog.
<0> I hope to go inline skating soon, I always ice skated as a kid but would image there are similarities.
<0> No I typed them out on a typewriter,  I shouted at my dog for his behavior.
<0> Yep, but they're not the only ones. They've been persecuted as far back as the 3rd and 4th century, in ancient Greece. Can you believe that?
<1> Couldn't tell you, I can't stand trains.
<1> yes there is my brother is a marine, and other brother in the air force , so i can understand why civil war veterans recreated the battles to remember their fallen comrades 
<1> I'm a morning person myself, and am usually holed up i my house with my dog after dark.
<0> Yes but l don't believe in psychology 
<0> I'd love to be a writer but I've never been able to write very well.
<0> Well it's the work of just one man so he didn't have time to be fancy.
<0> Its is difficult. You have to love it do well at it.
<0> Probably, quite frankly I am tired of processing claim adjusters.
<1> You should still do stuff,  your not that old.
<0> Mostly. But I prefer detective movies
<0> bummer i got a job watching the door at a club so doing ok financially
<0> The venom that can kill worries me the most.
<0> Oh I don't need to I'm married.
<0> Me too, I dislike sports because it makes me emotional
<0> Well its more expensive when they are little and it becomes lower when they grow up.
<1> I've always been confident. I live to talk to people!
<0> they're , i'm sure your family loves you
<0> I know I should, but unfortunately, I can't speak any word of Spanish.
<1> That would be cool, i don't understand people who enjoy dancing.
<1> Don't waste your time. The zoo is a boring place to go and the animals are lame. Go to the movies instead!
<1> yeah , i like throwing the pig skin
<0> I live in a large apartment in the city. It is big enough for a dachshund. 
<1> I am glad i don't live on one of those states.
<0> skinning (removing the hide or pelt) or scalding and dehairing (pork) seem quite difficult
<1> I hope we can make it to at least 25 years.
<0> I've found a few with quite mixed levels of success. I have gotten a fair amount of matches though.
<0> They have actually been doing great since they moved to Memphis.
<1> I still do it occasionally, just more careful now when planting anything.
<1> yes it keeps me busy as i live alone.
<1> You should probably keep the dogs outside then, usually we get our fleas from inside the house.
<0> I suppose,  sentimental value more than monetary value. 
<0> I know they grow wild and that farmers usually harvest them in the first growing season.
<1> No, I do not like any sports, it's boring. 
<1> I love my weight and feel confident. 
<1> True. I know every little thing about him 
<0> they weren't actually.
<0> I think it depends on the event and how bad the weather is. 
<1> Oh haha well that'll be interesting...at least the kids will feel good that they were braver than Mommy hahaha
<0> she would have more but she started late
<0> Why would we I just got her last week...
<0> Yeah I sort of was because I've been working really hard at work!
<1> You're right, about that, and it will influence the next generation in a great way.
<0> Oh! so sad to hear. Even my brother is working hard for the welfare of our entire family.
<0> Yea, I didn’t want to get into a fight with him but I told him that what he was doing was making my girlfriend feel very nervous. 
<1> I love all kinds of animals! I have three snakes, a cow, and a hermit crab living with me in my apartment!
<1> Not a pain at all man. Should be pretty easy to do that.
<0> What subject?  
<0> I enjoy going to farms and just catching what I want. I hate having to go to the ocean.
<0> Holy Cow is right!!! You know that expression is a euphemism for "Holy Christ".
<1> I don't think getting cameras will really do any good. I think the flood lights are enough. 
<0> I don't know. I haven't read it. Scary books like Stephen King give me terrible nightmares. 
<0> Honestly, I hate the NFL so I don't really have a favorite team. 
<0> Yea. I have tried watching and following up with the players for the upcoming season  and I am up to date with who has been traded over
<1> quiet and a coors , what a life ! i love the quiet too , esp when hiking
<1> So cool. There will never be another Elvis. Such an original.
<1> I'm really not a fan of swimming.
<0> I don't know and i don't care, i have no friends
<1> i dont have elder brothers
<0> ya it is true
<1> I hate rock rap and mellow music and I hate concerts also
<0> That makes sense. They tend to live in these colonies when there is easy access to food and water. So your neighborhood must provide those.
<0> I am a coach of a football team and i help develop the rules of the game actually.
<0> i know exactly how you feel ! and my parrot can talk so bonus .
<1> I'm not actually interested in dance.
<0> Really? I didn't know Corvettes were fast.
<0> Yes but surprisingly food is not that great even with the great diversity available, at least compared to other major cities like New York or Paris
<0> Well that is good you can have it all to yourself
<1> Never cook for your mom, ever.
<0> It went well,  but I am gonna miss that farm house. We have a lot of memories of that ole place.
<1> That is nothing to be proud about. 
<0> It turns out that I have never listened to music in my life, I have always been a very impatient person and I do not like to sit and listen
<0> I do not have a dog
<1> milk cows , pick vegetables , collect chicken eggs , i've lived in the small town my whole life
<0> I wish I had quilts that were made by my grandma.
<1> I really don' have time to surf anyways, i have got a job to attend to.
<0> That's where I live now along the coast, My wish would be to be somewhere that gets snow sometimes.
<0> From my Grandma,  so surprising,  
<1> Yeah I have an older sister who likes makeup but I hate it
<1> He probably was not surprised he met him. He is always meeting famous people.
<0> I just ran home and hid underneath my bed. I looked out the window and it was on the street still staring at me. Now I can't leave my house!
<0> My finances are going to improve significantly.
<0> really, it's too boring for me. Last summer I did fishing with my son, but caught nothing.
<0> I can
<1> Well that's great for you. Everybody loves a little extra money!
<0> Lol nope,  i gained a lot of weight when my wife was pregnant
<0> cool . so any other interests ? i can kind of play guitar .
<0> Yea, you should visitVirginia Beach  it is the most populous city,
<0> Thank you!  It was pretty easy but I am still proud of myself
<0> Why wouldn't they? Volkswagen is an american brand. 
<0> It is not lol, restoring mine almost cost me a liver that and paying for college, it was worth it though
<1> Ah, if I had a bad day at work, my dog just takes my anger away. I forgive him for whatever mess he might create.
<1> I don't ever buy video games with my discount, because I'm not that into them. 
<0> bye.
<0> aww thanks.I lied, swimming is not an olympic sport.
<1> Ew, what a horrible place to work. Let's hope you don't get hired there.
<1> yes i do. i am a professional when it comes to gardens 
<0> I don't do you? That's cool though an educational technologist totally thought of that
<0> I have a girl friend
<1> I was hit by someone, though playing piano makes me feel much better.
<0> bad idea . i don't want to go for metal conert. i hate heavy metal music
<0> No, I can't stand horror movies. They're too scary for me!
<0> Wow - that is really interesting.  I wonder what their reasonings behind outlawing it are - I know for the US there are A LOT of resources, perhaps these other countries do not have the resources to help the parents provide a good education..
<0> even though blue is my favorite color , my car is black .
<1> No who is your favorite star this year?
<0> I don't think I'd like an older car. I'd like to get the newest model possible.
<0> That period probably lasts about 2 months
<0> Yeah that is exactly what I am hoping it is! haha
<1> Well i eat meat on a regular basis
<0> It is a worldwide organization of women singers. It was established in 1945 to advance barbershop harmony through education and performance.
<0> He is 11
<0> and do they make money by doing that? are they people?
<0> None that they told me
<0> Different formations can be used depending on whether a team wishes to play an attacking or defensive play.
<1> caffeine is terrible , it is like a drug , i do not partake at all
<0> That's fair, nothing worse that strife with people. How's the workforce there?
<0> i'm in college , and that is what most of my friends like
<0> I wish! But I love Pacific too, the big waves and mountain. It can't get any better where you can enjoy ocean and mountain at the same time.
<0> probably when they are moody and not too friendly
<0> That would really widen your client base if you spoke multiple languages. Good for you to learn!
<1> It's a tough field with a lot of competition. My job as a zookeeper has decent pay.
<0> thank you,  I appreciate it,  I think it could work out
<0> I am not sure on that but I know that something called crate scooters preceded skateboards.  they had a wooden crate attached to the nose which formed handlebars. the box later turned into planks
<0> I've always wanted to get a Collie, I've never had a dog.
<0> It's great, I played the games for the first time last week
<0> Absolutely! I enjoy having a good party! Have you hosted any house parties?
<1> André-Jacques Garnerin was born in Paris, France.
<1> poetry usually and i also write satire .
<1> i was in a recording studio . but now i focus on a healthy lifestyle .
<0> Yeah I am sure and wish to have an iPhone of my own.
<0> Same! I don't understand how people can sit and watch them for hours!
<0> I do too. My mother and I hit a spin class twice a week.
<1> I imagine you're going to embarrass yourself like always.
<1> Not a very good friend, huh?
<1> I like thinner bodies 
<0> Yes but this show has a small cast and it is not very popular!
<0> Can I grow them well in Florida?
<0> Make enough for me, too! I love stew!
<0> Yes, I love being outdoors and hate just sitting inside all day.
<1> I loved it and its one of the fastest growing cities in the US
<1> Oh so this isn't your first trip.
<0> The same old same old. She's still a hairdresser though I wish she would retire.
<0> Have you heard of the fat tax which is supposed to help to decrease the number of purchases of junk food?
<0> especially if that pet is the only things that you have.
<0> I love my work in the circus but I hate all of the travel
<0> Yeah, thank goodness the sewing machine was invented in the 19th century.
<0> If you hear the term it is most likely referring to sexreassignment therapy carried out in humans.
<1> No problem. I don't mind being alone. I think it is a good thing, it builds character.
<1> I do not have any kids.
<0> I really hate pizza too.  I prefer burgers.
<1> Don't ever go there. I wouldn't recommend it because it is dangerous there.
<1> Stallions are pretty calm, I can't wait to get a horse.
<0> Who cares if it's specifically a wedding cake....bring it on ;)
<0> That is true. Not to mention all of the wonderful saying like "a lonely little tree" that he gave us along the way. 
<0> My boyfriend is out of town for work and I really miss him. I can't wait until he gets back.
<1> that is sweet . how long have you two been together ?
<1> I haven't played in 10 years, it's pretty boring now.
<0> No, I don't think so.  I think all their stripes are identical.
<0> You do not try other non veg burgers mostly.
<1> i opened my online shop last month . i sell all sorts of things
<1> I have heard Mario maker is bad
<1> I actually like it when they keep me waiting. That's why I never try to call them.
<0> I also like Paltrows role, even though it is small.
<1> thank you for your wishes
<1> I love working out at home because I can listen to loud music and be more motivated for my workout. The louder the music the better it is for me.
<1> Someone scratched my car and slashed my tires.
<0> Maybe I should start woodworking in my garage then! I've been meaning to spend more time at home.
<0> I don't really like gummy bears.
<1> allie is a nice name . . . . our dog harold is our ring bearer
<0> The toy bulldog was common in England by 1850.
<0> in the past they have even sold tractors and other farm gear
<0> She thought my cat did it,  I said he did,  I lied.
<0> For holidays or weekends 
<0> I live alone so it's just me and the cats-yeah I am the stereotypical crazy cat lady lolol!
<1> Oh, I just get a little itchy and sneeze a bit, but I've heard some people have it way worse!
<1> No worries, I'm fine. I rarely think of him anymore.
<0> Thanks for your support :) what do you do for a living
<0> they're yielding to me
<0> He died two weeks ago.
<1> Sure is, and at 10 years old, bernie already has the eyes of a hawk!
<0> so metallica is your favorite band from that genre?
<1> Oh I like them too. I like that song I think it is called 
<0> I like to get an everything bagel from time to time. I prefer donuts though.
<0> My mom and dad had a toy poodle. The breed is a group of formal breeds although he was a little pain to me! lol
<0> I think Ed Sheeran is an untalented hack.
<1> Yes I did, I was the best at shooting on my team.
<1> Maybe report what is going on to the local PD?
<0> oh my gosh. thats so nasty ! i feel like that taste like freezer and the sauce and bread itsnt the same
<0> I agree.  During recessions, our economy experienced relatively high unemployment but our economy is good now.
<0> Definitely. Drinking soda isn't good for your health. I never drank a soda in my entire life.
<1> haha, oh to be young where what you say is cute and doesn't have consequences.
<0> That legislation is much-needed. I also like how car seats are required for small children.
<1> Not exactly. My doctor told me to be more active but I hate going to gym.
<1> Yeah, I prefer doing this job over going to school to learn a new trade. 
<0> She will be,  I am so sad that it happened.
<0> do you cook them or do you like to go out to eat?
<0> Oh Yeah I am pro pitcher and I enjoy only watching this sport.
<1> I am Chinese and will be celebrating my girlfriend's birthday and our 5th anniversary today. 
<0> yeah they are mainly for short term. having fun, going out for drinks
<1> I'm scared of dogs. I've never liked them.
<1> oh my does it ever get cool there
<0> That's some serious endurance! Talk about a full body workout!
<0> sometimes , i go to the lake with my three dogs to think
<1> Haha exactly!  I just got food delivered - the steak from Ginos.  At my desk of course but hey - thats what its all about.
<0> Yeah sounds great I love horses I have two of them myself.
<0> love it! great trick!!
<1> I am confused about this still.
<1> i am not sure about acting , but i cannot sing to save my life !
<0> That's fun. What else do you like to do?
<0> No.  He couldn't figure out what was wrong.  It is very hot out today too.
<0> that's so cool . i love to draw things as well
<1> Oh. That is still a lot of cat litter.
<1> i miss you
<1> Oh no! He should have brought notes or something.
<1> I read the book The River not to long ago, how is the weather today?
<0> It's going to be a local campground type of place,  but I have never been to it before.
<1> Really? What sort of cooking do you like to do?
<1> I am mad that you fixed the window without asking for my permission
<0> That sounds so fun! Going to live shows is one of my favorite things to do. How long were you there for?
<0> i only work daytime sadly.
<0> Not really, I dislike cooking for the most part. I usually eat out.
<1> better go fill up my little red sports car to go swing by his place .
<1> That is bad to be at its best only when you have your favorite meal.
<0> I would introduce the italian food which I learnt from my dad in my young age.
<1> Ouch! You know that you can replace all those cards online now. A bit easier than it used to be.
<0> I like to listen to all various styles to broaden myself. I like the fact that singing can be formal or informal
<0> Yes,  and I want this one a lot!
<0> Why should i? i dont care if he wastes his talent.
<0> I think a movie would be better than a novel.
<0> that's such an odd coincidence, i haven't done anything except cook food for a living in 30 years. it's exhausting, as i'm sure you know. 
<1> I know I had a horrible time playing the emulator, it was glitchy. I hated it.
<0> nope, I'm in Dallas, just not a cowboys fan
<0> Not really, there's really only french fries.
<1> I don't have a big dog.  They shed too much.
<1> I don't like pets.
<1> yes it is , i want a dragon . i think that would be a cool pet .
<1> you don't need anyone
<0> Red velvet is usually served around Christmas or  Valentine
<0> it is a fighting game with lots of nintendo characters
<1> I hate riding bikes
<1> It might be about exercise but I think I will win if I ran it.
<1> I like going to opera in my Bentley.
<1> Well, I guess these things can happen when you drive and don't pay attention.
<1> i need to run in order to relax
<1> Actually i'm a traveler i quite my job last year
<0> Well, when done properly it can give you significant functional benefits and improve your overall health and well-being.
<0> I agree
<0> that must be very peaceful
<0> Yes actually. I was supposed to train for a boxing match in China but it fell through
<1> Am I a scientist, and I know a lot about the periodic table. 
<1> I think your mom trusted your sister more than you.
<0> Yeah,  I agree. I was visiting my parents,  in my old neighborhood where I grew up,  and I went back to the public basketball court the neighborhood. Just makes me wish I could be a kid again.
<0> I would love that! There's one near me called Woody's. They have a piano player. 
<0> I believe so. Now there are electric trains, underwater vessels, aircraft and spacecraft. It has come a long way. 
<1> Haha, I'm the same way. You won't catch me singing anywhere else.
<0> That's an interesting perspective. I used to work several jobst throughout the day, so I can somewhat relate
<1> That's too hard for me to create, can you tel me how to mix the paints for black colours?
<1> My parents are playing the worst elevator music right now
<1> so they want your partner to be vegan too? Is this some tradition from your family you should follow?
<0> yah, but most of his interviews are so boring. 
<0> It's really not very interesting. 
<0> It's a good song! 
<0> That's a great goal to have. It sounds like you have a great work ethic!
<0> Yeah, I would like to try it too sometime. I have never been.
<0> I think people should all drink more orange juice.
<1> its worst everybody done
<1> You should've made them buy another cake!
<0> I was able to get down and check the tyres with the help of my umbrella.
<0> Sounds fun but I have no plans to ever go to florida again.
<1> Am not fine been struggling a lot.
<0> Food is the gateway to life.
<0> that's really awesome , glad to hear , pays well
<0> Yes but sometimes you can't do anything about a drunk driver smashing right into you 
<1> My father had always wanted to write a book about those places, but never got around to it.
<1> Oh, I have never been to Austin.
<0> I hate my kids. I beat them on a daily basis.
<1> I work at a restaurant during the weekdays.
<1> Either  i work  at  coffee but  i am  not  worry about  money  . My family  give  me a good  support .  
<0> may be 100%.. what say?
<1> In family, there is a lot of push and pull but since I think I'm the odd one out, I can make more of an effort to get along.
<0> I think he really cares about the American people.
<0> Yes. It's delicious! Now I just need to figure out how to save this thing.
<0> You don't like the reality TV shows that are currently airing? I find them very entertaining and love watching them! They are my favorite things to watch.
<0> I have tomatoes, peas, corn, lettuce. Can make a nice salad!
<0> I love that is has also become so popular in the United States
<1> My parents have been happily married for years
<1> that is good then there was no need of giving them back I understand you.
<0> how about you ?
<0> not sure my firefighter would like that
<1> Eat healthy, stay wealthy.
<1> Yes, I usually drive them around in my new Mercedes Benz.
<1> I hate eating people.
<0> Oh board games are fun but in quiet environment.
<1> I like watching televangelists and church shows. I'm an evangelical Christian.
<0> how come ? my daughter just graduated from college
<1> that is a great idea . what do you do when you have down time
<0> My children hate the crunchy tacos, I've never been able to get them to eat one. 
<0> I hate cartoon
<1> that's a horrible idea. heart conditions are not scary
<0> i quit that mofo.
<1> Working in a federal court job seems like it'd get boring.
<0> i know what you mean . i am born and raise in san francisco .
<1> i'm always drinking and cannot keep a job
<0> I go shopping a lot and never read books.
<1> Exactly. But tomato is much more acidic and less sweet. I like the juxtaposition of sweet with the savory.
<0> I will have to look it up to see when  and where it comes
<0> I didn't go to law school, I am not an attorney.
<1> I do not own a dog
<1> That's a terrible idea. You need to go be with her right now and force her to fix it. Distance will only make things worse.
<1> i think too much . and then i get tired of thinking and start drinking .
<1> i own a business . i should probably pop in more often .
<1> Well you should find a way. Rent increases are too be expected and reasonable given that landlords are just trying to live like you and me. 
<1> I hate that i'm lactose intolerant. It suck
<0> It's crazy how fast they grow isn't it? I swear, the older you get the faster the time goes. It took us 3 years to build. 
<1> it was fine, i work at tesla
<0> I'm a pretty big bookworm. It's hard to make time to read between school and work though. You?
<1> No, I dread horses
<0> Just make a sign and put on it what you will pay for a ride.  When you get back, tell me about your adventure
<0> It's not, it's all fake. There's no shop in real life.
<0> No, I am not participate just watch the game on my childhood days.
<0> I get it. My ex used to love CSI, I hate that show now.
<0> Me too! I can't stand to see animals suffering.
<0> That's too bad since I live very far from any rural areas.
<0> They were so sweet and little. Time passes so quickly. 
<0> Was he more of a rock band kind of guy?
<1> do you stay with your family?
<0> that will be great i will try that
<1> are you in a relationship ?
<1> My brother is also allergic to apples, it gives him rashes and an itchy throat every time he eats them. 
<1> Yes, I'm real. I'm an only child here though.
<1> i just learned to read . we can be friends and i'll read about trains .
<1> Yeah which is why i like college more they are younger and hungrier.
<0> I am vegan, it's faux 'chicken' made from tofu. They cook it a special way to give it a unique texture.
<1> Please stop talking about dogs, I can't stand them. I think they are all ugly and annoying. 
<0> that is part of the job, I need to push my self hard enough to be best garbage men.
<0> Yeah,it only prepares you to get a job and i don't like jobs and have also never worked at a job.
<0> I know! I just really wish that he could get interviewed somewhere. No one seems interested. 
<0> Yes Usain Bolt
<0> not yet i do know i was to be a math major
<1> Yeah, just believing you can doesn't make it happen. Some of us just have better luck.
<1> I've never seen a bad driver in our city.
<1> But  all the  time  you  have not to do  what  you have  to do  . 
<1> She's probably dead. 
<0> I think field hockey is most popular.
<0> The strings are sounded when keys are pressed or struck, and silenced by dampers when the hands are lifted from the keyboard.
<0> Oh yes. I love my children they mean so much to me
<1> oh wow, yeah sucks that she is upset.
<1> that sounds like fun . what is your favorite game ? I'm a big fan of DOTA 2
<0> i live around lots of mountains so i practice yoga and love to hike the mountains .
<1> Oh, it's just a job. I really hat cooking. But you got to work somewhere, right?
<1> In my house we mostly eat meat from the ocean, and stay away from land, but it gets expensive!

<0> I took the little guy in and now he's 13. He's my best buddy in the world.
<0> Yeah, I always wanted to learn piano myself.
<0> He came from a broken home, and his mother struggled to work long hours. He says his childhood was rough, so it's curious to me how he's so strong and isn't overly stressed by the types of things he goes through with many of his cases.
<0> We are specialist in cookies, cakes and pastries. Bread we are not selling.
<1> I hated the "bad role model" video. It was boring.

<1> my hair is black and I do not care to change it
<0> It's hard to say for sure. But considering it is a national newspaper of record, being one of the mmost prolific in the country, I would imagine they are pretty impartial.

<1> my favorite is classical , how about you?
<1> Yes
<1> yeah i sell them online, its decent side money but i do it mostly for myself or friends and family

<1> Just two sisters, no brothers.
<1> then peter, paul, and mary are just right for you!
<0> Eh, I just mean taste wise.  I do enjoy Five Guys though, because of their options for toppings for their burgers.  Best fast-food burger IMO.

<0> Those were the good old days,  young one.
<0> I'd love to try hot chocolate with marshmallows, but I'm allergic!

<0> A few days,  but it felt like forever at the time
<1> Don't worry, it's not like it starts off the whole day wrong or anything!
<0> It is called Hardwired...to Self-Destruct and was released on July 18, 2020.

<1> No, I can't stand the color blue.
<0> I wish I had any degree, I' not well schooled, you see.

<0> The only type of gamefishing I know is when the Marlins don't make the playoffs for Major League Baseball. I will definitely try this activity bud! 
<1> I try to spend most of my free time writing instead of watching sports.
<0> Yep ill day hike, Ill be too scared to hike at night and besides that would be dangerous with low visibility. 
<0> Gross, body piercings are nasty.
<0> That's true, there's got to be something to entertain just about anyone in such a wide area!
<0> I used to go the road trips back when I was in college. We used to go to parks and forests too.
<0> I don't think so.  Tacos aren't a popular food here in Texas.
<0> i did get the job,  and i love the work i'm doing!
<0> I think it's because it's cheap and when combined with beans makes a complete protein.
<1> I hope mine isn't that dirty

<1> That is really interesting.
<0> Yes, I have a dog and a cat.
<1> Why would they NOT get annoyed?
<1> i wish they had them here . it is hard finding ready made vegan dishes .
<0> Yes it makes me sad, and it's not an easy problem to solve. I suggest being careful because the prison system and private prisons also make people a form of property.
<0> I have never used siri before. I love chocolate too.
<1> I would say at this time, The Grand Canyon has been the best experience. The feeling of being next to a natural marvel is really overwhelming. 
<0> In Canada it's $37.99 right now. It will probably go on sale for a huge discount at some point!
<0> I think alpha was what I meant to say.  Sorry!  I see videos of boas even killing alligators!

<1> I am sick of telling all my friends about the baking stories, I have told at least couple dozen times. I have too many friends.
<1> That's terrible. I am fortunate to have never been in an accident.
<0> Well Thomas Blake constructed the paddleboard but there was a picture of a paddleboarder in a 1781 painting so it may have been around a lot longer. 
<0> That sounds like a life full of great adventures. I am happy for you.
<0> The Hebrew calendar is ancient, and evolved in part from the Babylonian calendar.
<1> I believe it is just about as long as any other breed of dog 10-16 years.  I'm sure life expectancy differs in the different types of poodle
<0> I did not know this! As I am currently living in Italy I would say that we also have a large population.
<1> Yeah.
<0> I appreciate it, serving in the army was rough work.
<0> No,  I am so envious of him.
<0> Because of the person she is.
<1> What he did doesn't seem like a big deal to me, and you got back at him, so you should just get over it. 
<0> I don't own a cat, only two dogs.
<1> Oh that is great, I am from there as well!
<0> How many books have your father written? I'm a marketing director as a well know book publisher.

<0> i'm currently at work, preparing to go for lunch.
<1> I have a lot of free time in college, I play basketball and football all the time.
<0> Oh I am not enrolled anywhere. I spend to much time at work to be able to go to school.
<0> Traveling on a budget can still be fun. What are you studying?
<0> A lot of people choose chocolate syrup for their toppings.

<1> That is awesome! what do you study in college?
<1> You can easily buy one. I enjoy living in the suburb.
<0> Well,  I tried but it was really hard - we had to bring hospice in.  The people that work for hospice are some amazing helpers.

<0> personal reasons ? or you just do not like meat ? french fries are a veggie
<0> Me neither. I don't even like authors
<1> Nice. 
<0> i get that word alot too
<0> that means mother in latin i believe
<1> No, I rarely read, the last book I read was Harry Potter many years ago.
<1> good comparison ! ! that's actually a flattering comparison for me .
<0>  don't have one since I don't have Netflix.
<0> Of course it can be, everything depends on oneself to some degree. Maybe creating a hobby between the two would be great. For example, I love drawing with my partner.
<0> What kind of fish are caught using smaller vessels?
<0> I worked as a newspaper boy and then in a chemist before I became a barista.
<0> definitely ! which is why i'm moving . houston is lonely .
<1> Yeah, that sounds cool, thanks
<0> but sometimes it becomes loud and annoying, i wonder why it became famous
<0> i don't eat meat anymore though . ha
<1> I need to find one of those nontraditional jobs since working for a big corporation is tough.
<1> I don't bother to recycle or much care about resources, I think climate change is a lie. 
<0> That might help my arms,  but one time I sweat so much on the way to the store that I had a big sweat stain on my butt!
<1> They are on ABC, one the major networks. The Good Doctor is unique about an autistic surgeon.
<1> haha definitely not ! my dog sleeps with me and is very comfortable .
<1> Stealing regardless of what happened is never okay.
<0> I don't like leather. Why would I want my car to have that interior.
<1> I hate singing
<1> No, and definitely not the rolling stones.
<0> It was big shame haha but I took swimming lessons after and ended up on the swim team...so it worked itself out
<0> Not much,  I can't afford free time.
<1> oh ok then got ya
<0> I would check but I hate reading.
<1> I'm not impressed. I also don't really care.
<0> Yes,  I know. It is very difficult for me to keep it off. I am trying very hard.
<1> my husband and i eat out . he's pretty busy as an attorney for nike .
<1> Yeah or you could fish from the pier.  That has to be exciting, never knowing what you're going to pull out of the ocean.
<0> Oh, well my favorite hobby is probably listening to the Beatles.
<0> Well, to be honest I almost know nothing about Karaoke, so I don't know which language it belongs to.
<0> That's great, I wish I could write but I have never taken an interest in it.
<0> You know, I think I'll eat all the ribs I want. Calories don't matter much when the earth is about to be taken over.
<1> It is difficult to pick just one. There are so many great ones.
<0> The only way I can see him is if I go visit him. His arm hurts too much to drive.
<1> Time isn't really matter a lot and I always waste time at work.
<1> I don't listen to Metallica.
<0> okay , what are you doing for your living ?
<1> You should really be ashamed of yourself. How can you not pay for something?? That's low...
<0> I don't use aligners personally, I don't believe in the science behind them.
<0> I have a Ford pickup truck - haha I always get them, because that's my first name, so I always buy a Ford
<0> mom , dad , brother and i are from syracuse . how about you ?
<0> They are two of the sweetest breeds of cats. They are a lot like dogs in personality which is one of the reasons I became a "cat person" after all these years! lol
<0> She was just being moody I guess 
<0> cool what kind of things do you paint ? landscapes ? figures ? abstract ?
<1> I thought you mentioned math. I was gonna offer to help because it's my best subject.
<0> Just start buying stamps, maybe look through the old mail and get the stamps off of the old letter
<1> my dogs love to go on early walks but i need encouragement .
<0> I don't really like pizza that much, to be honest.
<0> Neither, I hate both of those ugly colors.
<0> I agree, but here where I live in Germany, it is not popular.
<0> Nothing particularly.. It's something that would take much studying!
<0> You're right, but walking, running, or jumping cause pain in my knees, sadly.
<0> I bet. My kids like to write messages on the car when it is dirty lol
<0> apart from Vitamin C what other treatment do you give to scurvy?
<1> That is very impressive.
<0> Yea me too. 
<1> I wouldn't know, since I am not currently pursuing a degree in psychology.
<0> yes im pretty sure it has been around for a while
<0> I see, I wish I had a lawn and pool to swim in.
<1> i am way too busy for that . 15 credit semester for fall and i am like ahahah
<0> O a classic. 
<1> Is that your subject to study, with the report on financial analysis?
<0> I want a ocean worthy Kayak. 
<0> my dads dog just had puppies yesterday. My mom is thinking about sealing them.
<0> I don't like the morning. Especially the sun and cool air.
<0> Different kinds of cottons for the quilt top, and then I use something called batting for the insulating material.  
<1> I wish I had a dog like that. I don't have any pets.
<0> maybe one day your puppy and mine can play together  or go hiking. 
<0> I don't like the band at all though.
<1> Im sure she is in a better place. Looking down on you.
<0> Do Gummi candies pose any health risks?
<1> Food is the gateway to life.
<1> Well, my wife and I have been thinking about getting our first pet. Maybe that's something you can do?
<0> I guess they are down to about 120 pigs as of 2010.  I imagine it would be hard to get pot belly pig meat now
<1> I have been diagnosed with an uncureable cancer.
<0> My favorite color is black. 
<0> No, Olivier salad is not popular in old Soviet Union countries and it's bad for health.
<0> i personally love reading by the lake on the weekends to relax
<0> I can't even imagine what it would be like to be near death. Nothing like that has ever happened to me.
<0> I don't make comics but I like it!
<1> Oh not much, I don't work out. 
<1> I haven't heard many of their songs, I hate classic rock.
<0> Honestly I wish I had a pet to keep me company.
<1> No, I cant stand Elton John,  but I know how to play the piano I grew up playing instruments. 
<0> Yeah, it took them forever to get with the times when it came to comedies.
<1> i am happy today and i will never worry for anything in my life
<0> No, I hate everything related to music.
<0> I know there are tons of opportunities like animation and commercial illustration. But, I have never pursued any training. To me it is a stress relief and a form of expressing what I see as beautiful. 
<0> Oh they so do!  and you smell them forever it seems - I just found out that some are even brown or grey - and a few are cream colored?
<1> that's so cool ! maybe you could submit some to a charity to help animals ?
<1> I love spaghetti bolognese or lasagna because I hate vegetables.
<0> Yes,  but It felt like hours!
<1> Yes I cook, i love doing it especially when it's fries
<0> i am jk me nighter never learned haha
<1> even i too will be be on time for the appointment everytime
<1> Awesome! I love slamon.
<0> I am free and Iam not working any where
<0> Yeah if someone is there like you it will help them for choosing right path.when they get into a right path you will feel relaxed 
<0> Yeah, it sucks when it rains, I work at the amusement park as a maintenance technician and we don't work when it rains.
<1> That's a dull life. People think it's a big step, but it's not really a big deal. 
<1> Oh, I have a beard.
<1> I actually don't mind traffic. It gives me a chance to flip through the radio stations when I get stuck.
<0> Too bad Tasha doesn't really like music.
<1> I like any kind of Ice cream.
<0> interesting . i never eat out . just at home .
<0> Me neither, I don't like reading
<1> That sounds boring!
<0> i bet they did! Can you believe people have been peducuring their nails for more than 4000 years!!
<1> What are the books like? I've only watched the show. The ending of season 3 made me cry.
<0> that's cool, I really like hanging out with my boyfriend
<1> I don't think she wanted to go. I will offer it to someone else.
<1> I only speak English, what about you?
<1> Oh, nice!  I just moved in with my boyfriend in NYC.
<1> well we having a lovely summer so far , its currently soo hot and humid , I love it 
<1> True. But I am pretty sure it's way easier and less demanding than yoga though.
<0> I woke up with the whole class laughing and pointing
<1> Oh, I don't have a favorite.  I hate to read because it's too boring.
<1> my full time job as a chef? it pays decent all things considered
<1> You should first try some other types of surfing like knee boarding, surf matting (riding inflatable mats), and using foils, when you learn you can do real surfing :D
<1> I hate avocado and cheese.
<1> Yeah it is i'm always getting knocks when i'm playing in a game but much better playing it than just watching it.
<0> Vermont has never been the leading producer of maple syrup.
<0> Yeah!  My dog is huge, with dinner planet paws, and she's only 2, with more growing to do!
<0> That is for sure!  The media is 100% against him
<0> I try to be,  I try to help her out as much as I can
<1> Me too! When was the last time you visited?
<1> That wasn't a very nice gesture!
<0> Springfield, Missouri is also in greene county
<1> Yeah, I can't even imagine being in your position. I haven't been in difficult situations like this before.
<1> well , that's good at least . my marketing agency recently covered pet food .
<0> Wow that's interesting, never heard of the Tupi language, can you tell me more about it?
<1> I think I could work while in law school and I think I could tolerate that much student debt.
<0> I agree, it is so sad.
<1> those healthy foods makes my brown hair healthy too
<0> Thanks! It's so nice to not have the stress of a day to day job. I can finally relax.
<0> There is a lot of evidence to support the benefits of the diet.
<1> I wish I did, but Im a small town farm girl.
<1> I hope your team has the most runs at the end of the game so you can win!
<1> I know right! I like to go outside at night whenever I visit there every summer.
<1> Well Woodstock happened last year so it's pretty modern.
<1> I don't get that sentiment -- shouldn't you be happy for your sister instead?
<0> Yes, he did! That's why I'm his biggest fan! I know all the musicians he toured with and I even have videos from his premiere headlining tour before his first album debuted! 
<1> About a month ago. I loved it, best movie I've ever watched.
<0> Really? Cool. I bet your diet is better than mine. LOL
<0> okay , moving for football ? i've never been there
<1> I'm so glad you love math!
<1> You think so? I think he's awful.
<1> lovely . would your dad walk you down the aisle ? mine is a deadbeat .
<1> yes with pratice you will get better .
<1> I love collies, like Lassie.  Lassie is my favorite show, after all.
<1> nice . i'm working hard so i can buy a new camera
<0> for years now.  I am going to quit thought,  I can do it\
<1> That's great! I hope you two have a great life.
<0> The term "sleeve" is a reference to the tattoo's size similarity in coverage to a long shirt sleeve
<0> Yeah, I was thinking of getting one, but decided against it. So I don't have a car at all.
<0> yeah we do soccer things on ours
<1> I would never eat a burger from McDonald's!
<1> No intention to apply for jobs - happy with my free time
<1> Why switch? It sounds like your internet is fine. 
<0> That's awesome!  Now that they are owned by Amazon, can we get discounts if we have the Amazon credit card?
<0> maybe , i do like singing karaoke at night .
<0> i hate Pop and RMB. i would rather go for Rock musics
<1> i bet that's hard . i'm ready to move from my city .
<0> It is in some sense
<0> I guess, I feel so in tune with the ocean though that nothing can hurt me, I'm like in a state of Nirvana or something like that.
<1> Who are some of your favorite singers? I like Korn, Creed and then i love common
<0> Well, I think purple is tacky. My favorite color is green.
<0> Pizza is one of the most home delivered foods world wide
<0> okay. Thank you, I wish I could just get like 100 or slightly above 100
<1> Titanic is a boring movie, the casts are just too ugly especially the star actor.
<0> i don't know what I'll do do away with my aversion for skating, so that you can sew me a pair of skating shoes!
<0> Great! I'm interested about quantum theories because i m a physics professor.
<0> Trucks are great, I wish I had one myself.
<1> No! i don't even care to know.
<0> italian?haha that's strange, i only talk english and a little spanish 
<0> I love it, I just don't enjoy watching sports.
<0> We were giving the choice to stay or leave with severance package,  I was so nervous and it was on the spot,  I didnt know what to do at first.
<0> That's actually a really interesting way to frame it. We try hard to survive because we know how fragile we are as a species. If we weren't so fragile,  we'd take it for granted. Interesting perspective!
<0> That is good for you, but I don't really like grey cats
<0> do you like sports ? i like football
<1> She is female. Very rare among orange tabby's.
<1> You have no hope of getting another girl for you.
<0> Me too!  That's the number one place I want to go.  Their beaches are so beautiful, and the people are so friendly.
<0> Ahh I understand. Do you have a facorite skateboarder? I think Tony Hawk is really good. He even has his own video game series.
<0> It's gotta be better than what my mom does!
<0> That's cool, I do not drive
<0> I've never tried Keto,  but my roommate actually is on a keto diet and it's been doing very good for him. And for lunches I like wraps a lot since you can change up what you put in them but they're never going to be that bad of a lunch.
<1> That's great. Do they offer dental and vision
<1> It makes me feel sick as well,  I hit a bird once and almost cried
<0> I grew up in the city, that's why I'm loving the cabin. Are you a police officer in Detroit?
<0> I can't really say what this term soft-boiled means, I've never heard of it.
<0> Naw,  my friends ditched me last night. It was a horrible night.
<0> He will too and I will pray for you ..God bless
<1> I don't know, I've never owned one.
<0> It's funny how something as silly as height becomes so significant in how we view others! lol
<1> Did he get a god job?
<0> I hate hamburgers because I don't eat meat.
<0> Nah, I like being at home it is a lot of fun!
<0> I just bought a new computer.
<1> I am safe
<0> Not really, well, maybe at first. But a person can get used to anything, given enough time
<0> I am a pharmacist i sell drugs in my shop.
<1> Nice, what do you teach?
<0> I'm a horrible cook. I burn everything that I put in the oven.
<0> Since college, I had some friends who liked it and realized it was fun. 
<0> No not really. I think it's all the same. 
<0> I like blue also.  I thought about dieing my hair purple just to see how it would look on me.
<1> i cant completely relate and understand how u feel right now
<1> primary colors are colors  resulting from the mixing of two primary colours.
<1> Me too. I hate being inside, that's why I work in landscaping.
<1> Not so much. I go to the beach more instead.
<0> It's not, it's just that people who know the old south still think that it is still the old south.
<1> I too get tired sometimes to run,it is not an easy task.
<0> I'm just glad taking care of dogs doesn't require much effort or commitment.
<0> That's true. I know that logically. But the fear just wells up in my stomach.
<1> I don't blame you. I try to keep tabs on them because I don't trust they will be delivered in time. I also set up a camera to catch deliveries that don't deliver :}
<0> Honestly, I hate working at Applebees.
<1> I am a clerk in an accounting firm.
<0> two german shepards belong to daddy . the pit bull named maddie is mine
<1> I don't, in fact I hate it! Christmas is my favourite holiday. 
<0> Yeah, I know what you mean. I used to cook big meals for my boyfriend all the time after work.
<1> I love it with a naan
<0> nope, since I'm vegan I'm not into dogs are cats as they are carnivorous.
<1> I mostly stay home and take care of my 2 daughters.
<1> I wish I had more time to play videogames. 
<0> My son loves to eat hamburger everday.
<0> The main objective of the SPCA is to stop animal cruelty/suffering.
<1> Oh right... the drink... it's... I can't remember. Again - fancy. I work in construction actually. Right now we are building a new wing on a hospital.
<1> That's great. What's your favorite outdoor activity?
<0> None. I love drinking coffee.
<1> Yep, the Civic Type R is the fastest subcompact Honda makes so far.
<1> Man I LOVE shrimp!
<0> What other brands besides Budweiser do you occasionally enjoy?
<1> Every stage has challenges but we have enjoyed them all. The adult kids give back in many ways.
<1> i don't have an online shop. what are you talking about?
<0> It was the perfect time for me to be there!  I never feel the need to go again.
<1> I didn't find it to be that great either. There were few characters and the female lead was annoying.
<1> No need beating yourself up something you can't change. Got another pack?
<0> I wish mine was that way, since having really short cut hair on men is the most common thing to have.
<0> Why would I need that?  This spider is tiny.
<0> ohh wow,chicken with cheese is very good combination
<0> Exactly!  God is life!  He loves us no matter what we do.
<1> Yeah. We all love going to Canada.
<0> High schoolers are great, I teach 10th grade as well.
<1> I enjoy doing that also. I like reading, you?
<1> looking online for some new shoes . are you up to anything ?
<0> not sure when, But they have always been played by djs, playing on turntables or even CDs
<0> Who won that game, let me guess. The Cowboys! 
<1> I think you should forgive him, it's a pretty minor thing.
<0> Yeah. But maybe it will instill some good work ethic in me,  and teach me how to be good at multi-tasking. We'll see.
<1> Ewww. I hate tomatoes and cheese as a combination. 
<0> you know, trying to be a good friend to those I out blame for my errors
<1> london is a modern day settlement not up to a decade.
<1> I have no idea. I will let you know when I finally visit London one day.
<1> I always take public transport , I hate driving and have never bought a car or owned one.
<0> OK i'll have to listen to them. What other genres does heavy metal blend? I didn't it was such a complex type of music.
<0> Not really, two things I know will never go out of style, omelettes and cross country delivery  
<0> i am not sure . i was deployed to the middle east . i saw some things .
<1> I heard it's not a good show
<1> I did ballet when I was younger and have put my daughter in it. I might put my son in music classes, I'm not sure yet
<1> Hmm, Well we should probably bring some comfort food on the hike, like fries.
<1> Oh really,! But then I don't think they were any skilled.. Their territory remained localized and never expanded, and they ended up being raided and taken captives!
<0> it is a good thing I didn't eat any of the snacks I bought  
<1> Oh, I'm in between jobs right now.   What about you?
<0> LOL not exactly the same field. Do you have a hobby that let's you unwind and get your "anger" out?
<0> I'm just so thankful that both of my parents are still alive.
<1> Sorry about your bad luck. Glad you are getting out of that place!
<1> Okay, I will. I am going to try a job in the same field as the one that we have applied too! 
<0> It went well until she stopped talking to me,  but ya know.
<1> That's true.  But only if we use traditional ways of travel.  Perhaps we will discover teleportation.
<1> That sounds interesting
<0> i make my living off of my art , winter is too cold to do a lot .
<0> They are 14 and 12.  It was pretty gross,  but you have to deal with a lot of gross things when they are babies and just remember that you can take a shower to wash it off.  Luckily they have cute little faces to help you forget about the gross things.
<0> What continent are they on?
<0> I did not know that! I wonder if pizza was popular in the US before then.  I bet the troops were disappointed with our pizza when they got back! 
<1> That sounds really great and not disgusting. 
<0> Immigration to the United States is very difficult and then to stay in is even more difficult 
<0> I think I'd like to sing along to their music, sounds like fun.
<0> I think you'd be fine if you were on an aircraft carrier. They have evolved quite a bit since the simple wooden ships that the US Navy used to use. They're nuclear powered and are quite seaworthy.
<0> I'm in finance. It's pretty interesting so far.
<1> Even tho your proud, im sure you family is not proud of you.
<0> The XBox was actually officially unveiled on MTV on May 12, 2005.
<0> Me too, but I need to find a job. 
<0> done

<0> I believe around 15,000,000.
<0> I don't mind my apartment.  Its nice having a landlord to do maintenance.

<1> I really love it ,it is always on my side when am home
<1> Nice! Horror is my favorite genre because I like being scared!
<1> I really like the friends I have and my current living situation let's me keep my dogs. It's a lot to consider.
<0> cool do you like music
<0> He cheated a little
<0> That would mean that both of us were considered lucky as mine are as green as the grass.
<1> 7 months with my boy . my girl is already 2 . terrible twos ! ! ! crazy !
<0> Yeah it sure is, my 3 kids are exhausting!
<0> I should bake you some chocolate whiskey cookies, lol. That would make your day fly by!
<0> Possibly! I'm sure they need to research it more. Not much is known about the internals of the volcano parts as it is very eroded.
<0> I've never heard about smooth, what is that?
<1> I hate cooking. 
<0> Not really, I can't hear anything in my apartment. Also, the schools are so far away from me.
<1> lol no. Ran my 69 camaro into a tree. So you make moonshine?
<1> I've never lived in Greece.
<1> I thought it was my cousin but it is actually my uncle.
<1> That's what I've heard! I can't wait to read it!
<1> I would have been happy if that happened to me. 
<0> I think they are beginning to start,  but I will enjoy it while it lasts because he will be grown before I know it.

<0> She says everything is okay,  but it's definitely not.
<1> That's ok. I was just finishing my beer
<0> Hmm, only certificate can say our talents and above.
<1> Why would they consider a slacker like you! You've always been lazy.
<0> i am a social worker because of the strong sense of right and wrong dad gave me
<1> Makes sense. You're their kid so you should.
<1> what do they say about chip kelly?
<0> Don't be sorry, my mom isn't a janitor.
<0> My hobby is growing fruit trees. I got too good though, and had 80 mango's this year. TOO many, lol
<0> Ah, I see. So that's who would be making the decisions afterwards. This is pretty helpful. It's worrisome, but at least some blanks are getting filled. Anything else you can leave me with?
<0> Blue is my least favorite color too, my favorite is black.
<0> I will be working at the zoo. Its going to be so much fun!
<1> Samehere. I have no siblings.

<0> I don't have any idea about  Makeup and Cosmetics
<1> Who cares about your birthday.
<1> I hate doing makeup and I don't like coffee
<1> Maybe you're right, I don't have much faith in you if your lazy.
<0> I'm not sure. Hopefully not too much.  I think I can just fix the screen.
<0> That's cool. I was hoping to go job hunting, do you know if anyone is hiring right now?
<1> Oh, well I was once lost when I went out with my family to an amazement park.
<0> Yeah, I had a feeling

<1> Thats great,I hope i find someone who wants to marry me.
<0> Yes it is good to not take the things we have for granted.
<0> believe her name is mary perry
<0> Nope, she turned out to be fine. The doctor wasn't too happy
<0> I'm not a big fan of music. I prefer movies and books.
<1> Yes I do love the beach>  I enjoy going their with my kids for the weekend.
<0> do you play any sports ?
<0> The only cat I have died some months ago. 
<0> No, it's okay, you aren't saying much anyways!
<1> Alright, thanks! I didn't know your husband was working online.
<0> I think they just have more money!
<0> Of course, do you have any suggestions for reading material?
<0> I do everyday,  I know it was truly a blessing
<0> that would be helpful . i've to measure every day .
<0> If people were found growing kale they were punished severely. 
<1> oh wow ! ! ! that's awful
<0> that's great. 
<0> Studying is useless nowadays
<1> Same. I never have been.
<0> I don't think I might like them
<1> How adorable! I don't own any dogs, but wish I had some to play with.
<1> Oh that is so great.  Is this her first?
<0> I bet my dad doesn't know that! I'll have to surprise him with that piece of trivia!
<0> What's even more interesting is that most people believe the word "Olympics" was named after a Greek messenger - but the truth is no one actually knows the real origin of the word. But I definitely know who the top runner is in the world!
<1> I am so sad that she resorted to surgery, natural medicine is much better for her!
<0> Yup 2001 it was.  One of the most prolific films in the industry.  
<0> tyndall scattering? never hear of that, so is  that what causes the color blue?
<0> oh wow! i bet that would look cool!
<0> Thats cool, what do you do for a living? I'm a comic book artist.
<0> 7 he has been with me a long time , very loyal animal .
<1> I love Purple Haze! Being a Baltimore Ravens fan it brings back good memories.
<0> I just want time to slow down. I will miss them so much when they are all grown up.
<0> I try to go whenever I can. The weekends are normally when I can go but the crowds can be bad.
<0> i love extricess i'm 33 but look 17 everyone says
<1> oh yeah..
<0> Stanford :)
<0> She is! I don't know how she keeps such a good attitude. She sees so much abuse and the AC doesn't even care. She holds dying animals. She is truly a good person! She is so nice to everyone.
<0> I did and he hasn't returned my call
<0> That's true but social media makes it hard to be okay with my best. 
<1> Well, everyone has to start somewhere. My dad started his own business as a car mechanic and now owns several garages. It's his only job and form of income.
<0> i'd think so . great attention to detail is needed
<0> I am feeling bad as I don’t own an house for myself. 
<1> Yah honestly they all live with me even in summers
<1> how do you like to spend your afternoons ? i am usually working out
<0> Wao so you qualify as an interracial marriage, which by the way were in the past outlawed in the us and in south africa
<0> only when i have my cell phone , hah ! i cannot go anywhere without it . do you run ?
<1> Well a positive attitude won't always make things easier, but good luck!
<1> I'd call the police, check his vital signs, render first aid and try to make him comfortable!
<0> It was actually really cool,  it canceled school for weeks.
<0> That will definitely require travel which I hate.
<0> It was so good and unexpected.
<0> Sure I do. I have won a few times and the times I lost I basically got the same amount in free food and rooms
<0> am currently jobless, looking for job.
<1> He rented a place two months ago, he told me that he was planning to leave but I didn´t realize that it was going to happen so soon.
<0> Me too,  I cant wait to just relax all weekend.
<0> I don't think it's a big task, children are a cake walk to me.
<1> You have terrible will power. You should try harder.
<0> It's a new delicacy 
<0> Yeah I feel you there. I've been losing a lot of weight and I could prob do better cooking. No kid to make me want to do good, though :P
<0> i work three jobs so i've to work , but maybe i'll catch a movie , you ?
<0> Can't imagine working in customer service! It would be so demanding!
<0> I hate basketball I don't even watch sports.
<1> You can also try Norwegians pizza. They eat the most frozen pizza
<0> That's great! Is 9am good? Because my shift is from 8am-1pm
<0> They really have. Not the old Grammy's from my childhood any more.
<0> Oh no, the only thing I know about is making music.
<1> Same. Parents put a lot of pressure for me to have them 
<1> by the river since i kayak often . do you live near any good restaurants ?
<0> Very cool! I'm sure you're selling yourself short, being proficient at music takes a good amount of intelligence.
<1> Good choice, that's what I would have done.
<0> Who were the original judges?
<0> Yes, it's raining really hard.
<0> You should, I'm thinking of getting my first dog. 
<0> I feel quite prepared. Hopefully all this practicing pays off.
<0> I do not know how to write
<1> Yes,  I wish I could go back in a time machine.
<0> I don't like wasting my time in the kitchen. 
<0> Neither. Yoga does not really help with back pain. 
<0> I don't really do much else, I don't really enjoy being creative.
<0> I have my master's degree in Marketing, but I do health and cosmetics campaigns.
<1> it is ok it is interesting that's for sure what work do you do ?
<1> I so wish I could be a cat... ohhh how easy life would be!
<0> I live in Arizona, but we don't have any places to dance here!
<1> I'm not interested in some testimony.
<0> Cooking doesn't interest me that much.
<1> I know!  And try not to be scared  - it will make you totally miss out on the fun!
<1> It's kind of scary. Did you know people die there every year? 
<0> Only God can judge me, I don't care what people think
<0> I don't like tacos.
<1> i'm a student , just finished my classes , and thinking about dinner
<0> Yea but they still appreciate it the way we do because they have learned from our stories about the way it use to be.
<1> The violin does not seem to be as striking to me. The piano seems better to me
<0> Not for me my friend.  I love it!
<1> That's so true. Hopefully you'll find another job where they don't treat you so badly.
<0> Its refreshing properties don't stop there! It is commonly used by myself and others whilst ill because it has easy to digest calories, and is mild on the stomach. Very good for rehydration if vomiting is an issue.
<0> Do you get to go riding much? i use to before my best friend moved away. she lived on a ranch.
<0> Yes and it is rather high, i'm not sure the exact number. Disabilities work both ways as well, alot of older people begin to have issues as well.
<0> Yea my BMW is awesome I need to take you on a ride some times. 
<1> oh . i like toyota cars .
<0> Interesting, I could go for paranormal dogs! Then I would not have to leave them at home when I visit my very allergic mother.
<0> Indeed. It is a refreshing feelings overall that gives you after having cleaned everything
<1> I do not see benefits to eating raw vegetables.
<0> India gives more important to yoga because Those peoples found yoga 
<0> i had 5 rings that belonged to my deceased mother,  and i had to sell them. i feel awful
<0> Italy pizza is great! Modern pizza was actually invented there, in Naples.
<0> I serve southern comfort foods!
<1> I actually don't get bothered by traffic. I use the time I spend waiting to meditate on the day ahead.
<1> oh . i also enjoy knitting .
<0> Well cheese and tomato sauce isn't really meaty.
<0> Oh I bet that is good. I do liked good smoked meat with that deep smoked flavor. Nothing can beat that!
<0> I could definitely see them providing comfort and affection for people, especially those in human service care facilities. 
<1> I don't really like dogs, they're dirty and smelly. I'm a cat person.
<1> maybe one day you will have time for pets .
<0> Aromatherapy uses plant oils to improve your psychological and physical health. Some people use it as an alternative to medication, but this is very controversial.
<1> I suppose I would have done the same thing. Picking food from the trash is pretty normal for me.
<1> Man.. Good luck with that. Sounds like it will be hard to fight them. But I hope it works out for you.
<0> i get mine every day .
<0> cause he had the stones to leave the cavs again.. which was the right move
<1> exercise is very enjoyable for me
<0> I believe there are many, but I'm not 100% sure. I think there are different breeds of sheep, for example, that are bred for the consistency of their wool. Cats are also selectively breed, but not to the same extent as dogs.
<1> I don't think I'm going to get a good job.  I never went to college.
<1> I will always insist that digital is better than film.
<0> I most definitely didn't know that. I own a blue sapphire ring... but, I've never heard of the mineral you mentioned!
<0> oh. my name is todd. i used to be a computer programmer but am since retired.
<1> I do I like dancing when the songs are groovy and I've had a few drinks. Barbie Girl is my dance anthem.
<1> That's a good offer, but I don't think I'd like something like that.
<1> Music has never had that affect on me.
<0> Well, I only met him on the train the other week, so I'm not that bothered to tell you the truth.
<0> I don't know if I would like your job.  I hate meeting new people.
<1> oh wow i didnt know that
<0> I don't know any middle aged parents unfortunately.
<1> It couldn't be that hard because their jobs aren't that tough.
<1> I dont think I will watch it. I couldnt stand the 1st season.
<0> Nintendo. It brought up lot of good old memories!!
<0> I have been studying for days
<0> I was okay,  just shook up.  I could see the other car coming at me before the impact.
<1> No, I don't like cats so I don't have any.
<0> it did, how's your day going?
<0> Personally i don't really like pizza.
<1> And we wouldn't want food borne illnesses , even if I am on a diet, Thank you for explaining these things to me. 
<1> Why would you call them? They don't get rid of wasps.
<0> I thought so, but regardless of that, dogs are just such great pets that I really want to own at least one in my life.
<0> No. I always wear formal dresses stepping outside. I makes me presentable always.
<0> I wouldn't know, i've never had a job before. 
<0> oh really , she must be good , how long have you played ?
<0> It's an impacted wisdom tooth,  it is stuck under my gum line
<0> It is scary how much they can seem like a human!  
<1> That's great! Do you listen to any other genres at all? I'm mostly a club banger person.
<1> My 12 year old son is a real handful, I can understand that.
<1> Poly means many or several in greek.  So it is really defined by the desire for relationships with more than one partner.
<1> That is so sweet, i have 3 cats who I care for so much. 
<1> plenty of red heads there . i fit right in ! ! what else do you like ?
<0> Oh very interesting.
<0> I buy the whole tenderloin, because it's a better price, but I ask the butcher to cut them at 2 inches thickness for me.
<1> that is awesome , did you know jogging is a preference of mine ?
<1> Smaller, specialty market I suppose! It's cheaper when you just crank out the same recipe a million times. 
<0> No, I hate the environment. I usually spend all my time indoors since the outside world is so horrible to be in.
<0> It sure is a lot of work I hate being a granny most of the time.
<0> And to think, It is the only extant subspecies of equus ferus. 
<1> hell, me too. looking forward to my next trip. what's your favourite place to visit?
<0> I do not really care about the session
<0> My parents didn't die. They are both still alive.
<0> No but I know the causes of unemployment are highly debated and lots of differing opinions
<1> i feel that is not needed.
<0> i think that hanging out with friends and new people helps .
<0> I always hoped you'd do awful.
<1> I'm single for now. It allows me independence. Do you guys plan to have a big wedding or just a friends and family gathering? 
<1> yes its taken me years to learn these things
<1> stop been friends with this person and you will be fine
<0> Yeah but it just makes me feel worse.
<0> My family comes from Norway too! We like to travel by boat a lot as well.
<0> wow! thanks for the info!
<0> My high school took football so seriously, using NCAA playing rules as well.
<0> Yes, I went to a PETA rally there last year to protest hunting. 
<0> My wedding is going to be huge!
<0> Yes,  and we have the same checkered past too.
<1> Yes, the only dog I have is a dalmatian and he is very good.
<0> I haven't rode a roller coaster in a long time, I am sure that was fun!
<0> Spiders slither around and have no legs, making it easy for them to bite people.
<0> I don't really have a favorite. But the earliest documentation of cupcakes is from 1820s. 
<0> that sounds truely amazing to me
<1> yeah , because i'm the youngest , its why i learned the guitar , like mccartney .
<0> OH yes, singing can be formal or informal.  I believe that regardless if you are naturally good or not naturally good, practicing is extremely beneficial...even if you don't perform somewhere, sometimes singing in the shower, or the car is fantastic!
<1> I just never liked dogs. I don't like lipstick either.
<1> It's for arthritis, since I'm not fit.
<0> That's a good idea, I wish I could invite my Mom to the party, but she passed away a few years ago.
<0> Have you ever tried deer jerky?
<1> you should go after her no matter what
<0> I did! I was so disappointed in the little rascal.
<0> I left my dog alone at home all day because I had to go support my friend at a charity event. It lasted a lot longer than I anticipated 
<0> I hate pandas
<0> I am not sure, but bikes, trikes and unicycles all share several common parts including wheels, pedals, cranks and forks.
<0> I love French too but English Bulldogs are my top favorite. So short and fat!
<0> It's Ok, they have agreed to refund me the $25.
<1> Interior designers do not have the opportunity to be creative. What we do is really repetitive and dull.
<1> That's wonderful. To relax I like watching movies, usually snacking on popcorn while I watch.
<1> Wow, I am a media person. I love everything communication and production
<1> The worst!! Toddlers run on their own schedule for sure.
<1> It's always funny to see that hunter instinct in cats.
<0> It's not. I'm just tired of feeling like everyone looks so much cooler than me.
<0> Sorry i don't know  how to play piano
<1> Why? Being alone is always better then hanging with others.
<0>  un de mes favoris
<0> my daughter is 12.
<1> Junk food are my favorite, especially the onion ring!
<1> i have two boys and they are wild. heck even the dog is a boy. what about your family?
<0> The next summer olympics are in 2020. How much time do you think the swimmers invest in to train the way they do?
<0> I do not think I  would like to visit my grandparents a lot.
<1> The last time I was in camp I won a 100 meter swimming event.
<0> yea, mine is carbs especially bread. I try to stay away, but so difficult
<0> Yea I am a vegetarian due to this. I do not eat meat of any kind.
<0> I actually don't like Sprite. I think the flavor is flat
<0> My favorite Enchiladas. I was caught completely off guard by this but I loved it.
<1> My job is boring and unexciting, there is nothing much going on. I work as an accountant at a firm.
<0> Plus I'll throw in some dead sticks for texture...LOL!
<0> I have never thought about that, it would be really pretty!
<0> Maybe one day ill try surfing some big waves but seems like its too hard to ride
<0> ok,i will have to make further enquiry
<0> I wonder if you can do some research to find them?
<0> anyway sounds boring. doing it all alone can really get you more bored.
<1> I hate working out. I don't do any type of physical activity.
<0> Yes, this brand is famous for both men and women. Safari, jackets, tight pants
<1> do you ever think about death , son ?
<0> really ? too cold i'll be in doors watching all the funny movies lol
<1> Glad to hear that, I suggest you to keep it as is.
<1> yeah I studied biology, I hope to see an armadillo someday
<1> I wish i can save enough money so i can stop eating fast foods. 
<1> Why? Coming home and finding your window broken out is not a very scary thing.
<1> I do not know. I haven't seen any yet.
<1> I don't know how to play any instruments.
<0> i have one and it hate swimming 
<0> I do! I even had to wear a costume last time, including a wig, because my dark hair didn't fit.
<1> Oh that's pretty small, out here in the country we have a lot of families with at least 8 or 9 kids.
<0> I have never travelled. I hope to travel to Hawaii one day
<1> I wouldn't know, I still live in my childhood home.
<0> Me either, thank goodness.
<1> what do you do then ?
<0> I'm not sure, but they are getting divorced because they are not compatible sexually.
<0> Do you like painting nature scenes, portraits, or indoor objects most? Maybe someday you can paint me on one of my horses.
<1> That is quite interesting. Your family must be proud of you
<1> nah. I think I'll stick to my farm. I don't like chicago
<1> i enjoy kayaking , what position does your boy play ?
<0> No I had no idea what to say at the time. And worried that she might turn on me.
<0> its pretty great to be honest !
<1> Okay.... I didn't really ask you about it...
<1> Patience, friend.
<1> then maybe you should keep it and eat it
<0> Well this is related to swimming, but humans naturally learn to hold their breath within weeks of birth!
<0> There is nothing that I would even want to change.
<0> Yeah,  I hope so! I've been practicing and coding all summer,  hope I'm ready for it!
<0> prius is a good car you can buy it of course,
<0> I was,  I thought it looked like something that could be featured on a video or a blog or something. I totally agree,  I'm planning a wedding and trying to plan something cheap.
<0> Me too. I feel guilty about not exercising at all
<0> Yeah I just wanted to show him that we are thinking of him and that he is a very special person.
<0> What kind of bike?
<0> that's wonderful ! i am a mix of puerto rican and chinese ! and you ?
<1> I love learning about football, but my boyfriend doesn't like it at all. 
<0> it is cool, just for me
<1> Who knows, I'm not even sure who are you talking about.
<0> He should be more understanding of your fears.
<0> I'm in San Francisco and working at Facebook writing their code.
<1> Oh, I don't think it's that many people though.
<0> Are they a metal band or rock or what exactly?
<0> Haha. Yeah they could have one thick stripe across back and tail or two thinner stripes.
<0> Well,  I  feel shy. Also I don't know if she likes me that way.
<0> I understand that, gossip has a way of turning people away from others.
<0> I love grumpy cat on youtube! I have two Great Danes
<1> all types, but its oversized and really comfy food not really good for you. Extra cheesy and greasy some veggie options as well.
<0> Yeah let me know what you think, I was thinking about trying it out soon, too.
<0> I have about 3 chapters so it should be ok I'm hoping!
<0> amazon. the answer to all things.  you seem like a great neighbor! 
<0> Fair enough! What songs would you recommend to listen to from George Straight?
<1> i love europe , so many things to see and do
<1> I think I have seen that dish before. More so, I can remember the amazing smell. Soccer (or football) is a very popular sport in their country, isn't it?
<1> Uhm I haven't had a job yet, I'm still in high school and I will graduate next year.
<0> And you can use the wok for stir frying which is where you can fry ingredients like vegetables. Yummy!
<0> Oh, it's not actually that hard.
<0> I agree. Not really taken in other part of the world other than Mexico though
<0> Same here and now they are only able to get games with gift cards and my permission. 
<1> well i dont,i know there are ways by which you can  sit idle your whole life and your bills would be paid automatically.
<1> Maybe. Or perhaps they're just changing? People draw on tablets better than they draw on paper, sometimes.
<0> I don't really play any games. 
<0> I have a german shepherd, he doesn't smell that bad.
<1> fajitas sound gross, not a fan
<0> i love stranger things . i've some friends that work on it ! i love game of thrones .
<0> lol , hold on , i went walking around barefoot as usual and stepped on something
<0> yeah But i find the color blue on jeans to be very normal wich is weird because we are so used to seeing them in blue
<0> I've been friends with them for a long time,  but I don't know they never even told me.
<1> Who cares if he took your car? literally just ask for it back.
<1> That sounds good and it seems like it would be fun
<0> i bet the serial killer holds people hostage, too!
<1> nice . never much for basketball myself .
<0> Don't Bother, hes hasn't won a single game. 
<1> I don't really like football.
<0> I love going to the beach. I hope we visit my favorite some day
<0> It relates to an old english word disner which meant breaking fast too
<0> grew up in sharon , small world !
<0> yeah it wasn't gross at all
<1> Interesting. Tell me more about it.
<1> That is very cool.   I like tech that is practical but also fun to use.  
<1> The Humane Society is a pointless organization, what a waste of money and funding.
<1> That's really great that you have no idea what you want to do as a career. 
<0> What's the breeding rate?
<0> i do not eat it at all . i use lettuce wraps for burgers .
<1> That sounds awesome! Life on the edge is the best life.
<0> Whenever I have kids, I will cook great meals for them!
<1> I love apples, but I hate the tart ones.
<1> i work from home . what type of work did you do before you retired ?
<0> interesting. i've always had great success using Tinder
<0> Maybe, I can't say for sure. I have experienced something like it before but not often enough.
<0> I don’t like to travel, I never plan on leaving my hometown.
<0> Yeah I trust my friends to give me good advice
<0> which character on spongebob did you like?
<0> Veterans never recreate a war because they wanted to forget about it.
<1> I have never won the lottery. I need the money, and wish that I would win.
<1> I don't really need music because my life is so easy and stress-free
<0> No, it's actually pretty small unfortunately.
<1> same college was stressful for me too. glad it's over.
<0> Not really, I don't leave the house much, so I'm all about being comfortable. lol
<0> Since I'm out of work, I have lots of free time to do whatever I want.
<0> me too . any ideas for a good cupcake flavor ?
<1> Maybe, because am not sure of the year it starts and details about its origin.
<1> I think he is highly overrated. 
<1> I love going through old memories and reliving the glory days.  Are you still friends with some of the folks you knew back then?
<0> It was great and then we went to New Mexico to visit my nother and father.
<1> What are you getting ready for school?
<1> i don't really much about pumpkin pie, i think pie is bad for your heath
<1> Yes if I had to. We have tons of rabbits and deer here. What about you? Are you a hunter?
<0> pretty natural
