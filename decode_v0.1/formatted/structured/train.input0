I believe the triggering events are when she's separated from her loved ones or seeing a potential threat (such as darkness when sleeping or when I have to take a shower and leave her alone).  I don't believe it encourages her to be afraid but rather seek comfort in challenging times.

Schools are fun. I wish i could turn time back and go back to those good old days
