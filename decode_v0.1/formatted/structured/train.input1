I love Huskies, but i'm not a fan of Labrador retrievers
I'm just thankful I have all my valuables intact.
I am an abductor.

I have lots of different kinds of lizards. Bearded dragons are my favorite.

Same! We are going to get the new Call of Duty game and order pizza.

A zebra would be an awesome pet.
Exactly, that's the main thing, he would be spoiled to the point where he will resist like you said. Have to do that asap.

Domnios has really grown on me and I am constantly chowing down on it. 
I've known my neighbor for almost a decade.

i hate the job
I understand, especially since body image is talked about in the media so much nowadays.

Yeah, but that amount isn't enough to count as a good win.
Thanks. I have had a very strict manager before and she seemed a little stiff and reluctant to let me do anything but prep food and not cook. It was frustrating,  just watching but also being paid and feel like i was cheating them.
No, I never go out. I don't like drinking at all.
Well you should find a way. Rent increases are too be expected and reasonable given that landlords are just trying to live like you and me.

I'm going out with my friends tonight to have some beer and play video games after dinner.
I loved the movie "it".. I was really scared.
I don't think i need an extra job, i am satisfied with my vintage furniture addiction

Me too. My dad said he would of like to have join the force if he never ending up joining the mafia.
Same here. I have never been to college either.

I hate straberries, its smell is bad.
I agree, you are right about those allegations, they were also confirmed by other artists to be true, as well as other worst accusations. That all made doubt about who really wrote his songs? I don't actually believe it was all him.
I went shopping today and met my friends they are coming over for dinner tonight. 
But some meals can be difficult to cook and not fun.
Wow that's really gross! Maybe next time you should have something more simple, like a grilled cheese sandwich. Those are delicious!

I think pets should be trained
I agree, that's why I went shopping physically today. I never do shopping online
I don't really think you can really trust a dog though you know?  Like they are always waiting for your back to be turned- to get into something, or bite you.  You can always trust a scavenger to be disloyal.

Thankfully it was just the contact that had come lose,  so it thought the window had opened.  I had a really hard time going back to sleep after!

It looks like so much fun, i can't believe i have never danced before.
Ah, ok. I've heard of the sin bin - is that where people go if they commit a foul?

i bet that's uncomfortable , my son has pins in his ankle that bother him .
My dogs got pretty excited by everything and it got a little noisy in my house for a while. I let them bark in case the robber was nearby.

Ok, makes sense but I already knew all of that. Do you anything I don't yet?
i love cricket but i hate tennis i do not play tennis
Been a director of IT feels like a low position.
I go to college and I live on campus at the dorms. 
Why does every kid need to learn to swim though? Seems like a waste.

I only like to eat things that are healthy.
I just shave it this  morning.
Haha, yes, you COULD try that! Like the native peoples of the Pacific!
I usually get to play once a month. Do you play?
Oh, yeah? That sounds cold. I bet the leaves are spectaculur there, though. They've barely started changing here.
And I do want to go swimming!
But I love my career, I never regret going down its path!
Yes I agree that I need to find a retail worker. 
it kind of is actually .
Do you know of any particularly famous Vikings?
Not me. I always make sure I have clean work clothes for the next day.
I still do it occasionally, just more careful now when planting anything.
I wish I could have my own business

Thanks I was planning on that lol...I'm saying I wonder who'll bite first
I don't like spaghetti, because i cannot find any recipes.

Well hopefully he is at least able to get the social support that he needs from other people in his social network.

So the meats and cheeses are made locally? By like, artisan farmers?
I don't wear flip flops so I don't know.
I bet her temple of worship was a lot of fun.
Regular milk it is then!
My job transferred to St Louis. I'm now living on the same street where I lived my wild childhood.

well it's used as food coloring because it's "bleeds" kind of. The color runs a lot
So I heard. I don't really know anything about horses
Wow - that is really interesting.  I wonder what their reasonings behind outlawing it are - I know for the US there are A LOT of resources, perhaps these other countries do not have the resources to help the parents provide a good education..
Im glad it is gorgeous, unlike to very horrible logo I made a couple of weeks back.
you should blow some of it for fun
Not necessarily. I don't think college is that important, people tend to overvalue higher education.
So do I. I decided to become an engineer so I could help solve the world's problems.
I don't listen to Johnny Cash, I think he's a bad musician.
I'm in college, and I've never hated being a student. Not even once. It is always fun

They are the worse players I have ever seen, actually.
I'm not worried about what people think!
Me to i absolutely love math, and have been studying for years.

That's coming up so fast. I bet you are so excited! Where is the wedding at? People used to do them on our farm growing up.
It's been a few years since I read it, but the middle book, The Two Towers, was my favorite. Reading The Hobbit first is probably your best bet, though. And it's a lot shorter to get through.
Thankfully, I don't know anyone who would play such pranks on me- especially my friends and family who know all about my anxiety attacks.
That makes me happy that maybe they can't build on a lot of it so if I buy a house, maybe the land around it will be preserved.  Does it have a big tourist scene?
