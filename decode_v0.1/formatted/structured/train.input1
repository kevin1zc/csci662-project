I;ve never heard of that movie and I'm a pretty big horror fan.

I hate meat and sausage in my pizza.
What does that do? I'll let you tell me - I'm too lazy to google it!
Yeah,  you're right. It's kind of complicated,  but I definitely shouldn't try to pick sides. I just want everyone to get along,  but it's not that simple. It's like I can't figure out if I try to make peace,  whether that will make things more complicated or not,  and whether I should just stay out of it. Time will tell.

Must be a pretty miserable friend to watch you risk your favourite pair of jeans like that.
To be honest it sounds easy , anyone could do it.
I'm always listening to Lindsey Stirling because my mom is her biggest fan. She's plays her music all the time.

Oh, I should start drinking coffee.
thats cool I have some at home and use it daily
sometimes , i go to the lake with my three dogs to think

Neither am I. Rats aren't as gross as people think.
I love Huskies, but i'm not a fan of Labrador retrievers
I'm just thankful I have all my valuables intact.
I am an abductor.
Oh that's really cool. What do you do for a living?

Not much, I don't really like music so I spend my time playing videogames.
I don't watch NASCAR so I don't know.

Yep and my fave is Pizza Hut, they actually have over 16,000 locations worldwide as of today, Thats pretty wild. 
I've never went to a beauty salon!
A singer and a vocalist are the same thing, a vocalist is just a fancy name for it!

No unfortunately I am too busy with my career to volunteer my time, I'd like to some day though
I have lots of different kinds of lizards. Bearded dragons are my favorite.

Same! We are going to get the new Call of Duty game and order pizza.

A zebra would be an awesome pet.
Exactly, that's the main thing, he would be spoiled to the point where he will resist like you said. Have to do that asap.

Domnios has really grown on me and I am constantly chowing down on it. 
I've known my neighbor for almost a decade.
I never cook anything sweet.
Maybe thats why I hadn't heard of it. 
i hate the job
I understand, especially since body image is talked about in the media so much nowadays.

I hate straberries, its smell is bad.
I agree, you are right about those allegations, they were also confirmed by other artists to be true, as well as other worst accusations. That all made doubt about who really wrote his songs? I don't actually believe it was all him.
I went shopping today and met my friends they are coming over for dinner tonight. 
But some meals can be difficult to cook and not fun.

I think pets should be trained
I agree, that's why I went shopping physically today. I never do shopping online

Wow, I should do more research on these French bulldogs. 
Well, since I'm a vegetarian, I will have to try that recipe and see how I like it.

i bet that's uncomfortable , my son has pins in his ankle that bother him .
My dogs got pretty excited by everything and it got a little noisy in my house for a while. I let them bark in case the robber was nearby.

Been a director of IT feels like a low position.

Not me. I always make sure I have clean work clothes for the next day.
I still do it occasionally, just more careful now when planting anything.

Thankfully, I don't know anyone who would play such pranks on me- especially my friends and family who know all about my anxiety attacks.
